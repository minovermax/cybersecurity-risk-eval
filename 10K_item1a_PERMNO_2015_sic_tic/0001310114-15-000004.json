{"cik": "1310114", "company": "SERVICESOURCE INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their agreements with us and expanding their use of our solution for additional available markets. Any decline in our customer renewals, termination of ongoing engagements or failure to expand their relationships with us could harm our future operating results.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results and grow, it is important that our customers renew their agreements with us when the initial contract term expires and that we expand our customer relationships to add new market opportunities and the related service revenue opportunity under management. Our customers may elect not to renew their contracts with us after their initial terms have expired or may elect to otherwise terminate our services, and we cannot assure you that our customers will renew service contracts with us at the same or higher level of service, if at all, or provide us with the opportunity to manage additional opportunity. Although our renewal rates have been historically higher than those achieved by our customers prior to their using our solution, some customers have still elected not to renew their agreements with us. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solution and results, our pricing, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customers or their end customers, the effects of economic conditions or reductions in our customers\u2019 or their end customers\u2019 spending levels. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us, renew on less favorable terms, terminate their services with us or fail to contract with us for additional service revenue management opportunities, our revenue may decline and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur revenue will decline if there is a decrease in the overall demand for our customers\u2019 products and services for which we provide service revenue management.\nOur revenue is based on a pay-for-performance model under which we are paid a commission based on the service contracts we sell on behalf of our customers. If a particular customer\u2019s products or services fail to appeal to its end customers, our revenue will decline for our work with that customer. In addition, if end customer demand decreases for other reasons, such as negative news regarding our customers or their products, unfavorable economic conditions, shifts in strategy by our customers away from promoting the service contracts we sell in favor of selling their other products or services to their end customers, or if end customers experience financial constraints and terminate or fail to renew the service contracts we sell, we may experience a decrease in our revenue as the demand for our customers\u2019 service contracts declines. Similarly, if our customers come under economic pressure, they may be more likely to terminate their contracts with us and/or seek to restructure those contracts, and for customers whose contracts are up for renewal, they may seek to renew those contracts on less favorable terms. We have experienced a decline in our opportunity under management from our managed services\ncustomers in 2014 as compared to 2013 and we expect a further decline in 2015. If we continue to experience such a decline in opportunity under management, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf close rates fall short of our estimates, our customer relationships will be at risk, our revenue will suffer and our ability to grow and achieve broader market acceptance of our solution could be harmed.\nGiven our pay-for-performance pricing model, our revenue is directly tied to close rates. Close rates represent the percentage of the actual opportunity delivered that we renew on behalf of our customers. If the close rate for a particular customer is lower than anticipated, then our revenue for that customer will also be lower than projected. If close rates fall short of expectations across a broad range of customers, or if they fall below expectations for a particularly large customer, then the impact on our revenue and our overall business will be significant. In the event close rates are lower than expected for a given customer, our margins will suffer because we will have already incurred a certain level of costs in both personnel and infrastructure to support the engagement. This risk is compounded by the fact that many of our customer relationships are terminable if we fail to meet certain specified sales targets over a sustained period of time. If actual close rates fall to a level at which our revenue and customer contracts are at risk, then our financial performance will decline and we will be severely compromised in our ability to retain and attract new customers. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our solution depends, to a large extent, on how effectively our solution increases service sales. As a result, poor performance with respect to our close rates, in addition to causing our revenue, margins and earnings to suffer, will likely damage our customer relationships and overall reputation, and prevent us from effectively developing and maintaining awareness of our brand or achieving widespread acceptance of our solution, in which case we could fail to grow our business and our revenue, margins and earnings would suffer.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could slow our revenue growth or cause our revenue to decline.\nA substantial portion of our revenue has to date come from a relatively small number of customers. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, our top ten customers accounted for 51% of our revenue, with one customer representing over 10% of our revenue. A relatively small number of customers may continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of revenue from any of our significant customers for any reason, including the failure to renew our contracts, termination of some or all of our services, a change of relationship with any of our key customers or their acquisition as discussed below, may cause a significant decrease in our revenue.\nOur restructuring plans may not produce anticipated benefits and may lead to charges that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are currently implementing restructuring and other cost-reduction plans designed to reduce our overhead and our operating expenses. As we experience changes in our strategy, we will continue to determine whether additional restructuring efforts are required. These restructuring efforts may result in significant restructuring charges that may adversely affect our results of operations for the periods in which such charges occur. Additionally, actual costs related to such restructuring plans may exceed the amounts that we previously estimated, leading to additional charges as actual costs are incurred. We incurred restructuring and other charges of $3.3 million in 2014.\nWe are also going to invest and re-focus our efforts to improve efficiency in our managed services business. These investments and changes will relate to technology, processes, and people. If such changes do not result in the improvements we expect, we could see a decrease in our performance in certain accounts, lower customer satisfaction, and therefore increased customer churn.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, many of which may be outside of our control.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain existing customers and/or maintain the size of our engagements with those customers;\n\u2022\nthe renewal rates we achieve early in an engagement and the time it takes to achieve the close rates expected for the term of the engagement;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively sell and implement our cloud offerings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of end customer contracts delivered to us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in close rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in our commission rates;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nloss of customers for any reason including due to acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe mix of new customers as compared to existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe length of the sales cycle for our solution, and our level of upfront investments prior to the period we begin generating revenue associated with such investments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations of our business, including the development of new products or cloud offerings;\n\u2022\nthe rate of expansion, productivity and realignment of our direct sales force;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of the introduction of new technologies or new services, including additional investments in our cloud offerings;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in delivery of our solution;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs, including data privacy;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our stock price and the impact of such changes on our convertible notes and related note hedges and warrants;\n\u2022\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nMany of the above factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in these Risk Factors. Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of such factors could result in our failing to meet our revenue or operating results expectations for a given period. In addition, the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our operating results to vary widely which could lead to negative impacts on our margins, short-term liquidity or ability to retain or attract key personnel, and could cause other unanticipated issues. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nOur customer relationships and overall business will suffer if our cloud offerings do not meet expectations or if we encounter significant problems implementing them for our customers.\nIn the fall of 2012 we introduced Renew OnDemand, our next-generation service revenue management platform. This platform is offered on a subscription basis and initially served as the core foundation for our customer-facing cloud applications. We have now expanded into other cloud offerings such as ServiceSource Revenue Analytics and ServiceSource Customer Success on the Salesforce platform. Renew OnDemand and our current cloud offerings remains relatively new and we have limited experience selling and/or implementing it for customers, as well as limited experience migrating customers from our traditional platform to Renew OnDemand. Given the complexity and significance of this ongoing transition, including as a result of the amount of customer data within our systems that will need to be accessed and migrated, our customer relationships, our reputation, and our overall business could be severely damaged if our implementations or migrations are poorly executed. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of our near term plans to run dual technology platforms as we move toward broad use and adoption of certain cloud and technologies internally while maintaining our existing technology platform. Similarly our business operations and customer relationships will be at high risk if our cloud offerings do not meet our performance expectations or those of our customers. This could harm our business in numerous ways including, without limitation, a loss of revenue and customer contracts and damage to our reputation.\nIf we cannot efficiently implement our offering for customers, we may be delayed in generating revenue, fail to generate revenue and/or incur significant costs.\nIn general, our customer engagements are complex and may require lengthy and significant work to implement our offerings. Changes in our go-to-market and technology strategies also will increase costs and create implementation risks for us. We also have limited experience implementing our current cloud offerings in general. As a result, we generally incur sales and marketing expenses related to the commissions owed to our sales representatives and make upfront investments in technology and personnel to support the engagements one to three months before we begin selling end customer contracts. Each customer\u2019s situation may be different, and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of our failure, or that of our customer, to meet respective implementation responsibilities. If the customer implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, we could incur significant costs without yet generating revenue, and our relationships with some of our customers may be adversely impacted.\nThe market for our solution is relatively undeveloped and may not grow.\nThe market for service revenue management is still relatively undeveloped, has not yet achieved widespread acceptance and may not grow quickly or at all. In addition, we are still promoting market acceptance of our cloud offerings. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of companies to engage a third party such as us to manage the sales of their support, maintenance and subscription contracts and subscribe for our cloud offerings. Many companies have invested substantial personnel, infrastructure and financial resources in their own internal service revenue organizations or in some cases have built or modified software applications to help manage renewals-and therefore may be reluctant to switch to a solution such as ours. Companies may not engage us for other reasons, including a desire to maintain control over all aspects of their sales activities and customer relations, concerns about end customer reaction, a belief that they can sell their support, maintenance and subscription services more cost-effectively using their internal sales organizations, perceptions about the expenses associated with changing to a new approach and the timing of expenses once they adopt a new approach, general reluctance to adopt any new and different approach to old ways of doing business, or other considerations that may not always be evident. New concerns or considerations may also emerge in the future. Particularly because our market is relatively undeveloped, we must address our potential customers\u2019 concerns and explain the benefits of our approach in order to convince them to change the way that they manage the sales of support, maintenance and subscription contracts. If companies are not sufficiently convinced that we can address their concerns and that the benefits of our solution are compelling, then the market for our solution may not develop as we anticipate and our business will not grow.\nDelayed or unsuccessful investment in new technology, services and markets may harm our financial results.\nWe plan to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our managed services offerings, and SaaS cloud offerings and other new offerings that will appeal to customers and potential customers. We have undertaken the development of our cloud offerings as our new technology to offer improved and more scalable service revenue management, including enhancements to our applications. In addition, we have continued to develop our cloud offerings to utilize a Salesforce based platform for our solutions. The development of new products and services entails a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk of diverting the attention of our management and our employees from the day-to-day operations of the business;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with research, development, operational and marketing activities; and\n\u2022\nwrite-offs of the value of such technology investments as a result of unsuccessful implementation or otherwise.\nIf our cloud offerings or any of our other new or modified technology does not work as intended, are not responsive to user preferences or industry or regulatory changes, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market, we may lose existing and potential customers or related service revenue opportunities, in which case our results of operations may suffer. The cost of future development of new service revenue management offerings or technologies also could require us to raise additional debt or equity financing. These actions could be dilutive to our stockholders and negatively impact our financial condition or our results of operations.\nWe sell subscriptions to our cloud offerings separately from our integrated solution, which may not be successful and could impact revenue from our existing solution.\nWe currently derive a portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud offerings for a few customers, and we package and price the applications we offer on such applications on a subscription model. We may not be able to fully develop a successful market for our subscription applications. In addition, because we have limited prior experience selling technology subscriptions on a stand-alone basis, we may encounter technical and execution challenges that undermine the quality of the technology offering or cause us to fall short of customer expectations. We also have little experience pricing our technology subscriptions separately, which could result in underpricing that damages our profit margins and financial performance. It is also possible that selling a technology solution separately from our integrated solution will result in a reduction in sales of our current offerings that we might otherwise have sold. An unsuccessful expansion of our business to promote a stand-alone subscription model for any of the foregoing reasons or otherwise would lead to a diversion of financial and managerial resources from our existing business and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset our investment costs.\nWe have separated our business units and such plan may not produce anticipated benefits and may lead to charges that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have separated the Cloud & Business Intelligence business unit and the Managed Services unit. Though both units still have the same finance, legal, Human Resources, and high level executive oversight. The establishment of these two separate business units may not be achieved in an efficient manner, and may not fully realize the anticipated growth and costs savings for a variety of reasons. Some of the risks relating to this plan include potential disruption of our operations, diverting management from other important work, failure to obtain anticipated growth rates, a loss of employee morale and productivity, including the effects of employee attrition, and costs relating to such plans exceeding the costs previously estimated.\nOur estimates of service revenue opportunity under management and other metrics may prove inaccurate.\nWe use various estimates in formulating our business plans and analyzing our potential and historical performance, including our estimate of service revenue opportunity under management. We base our estimates upon a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Our estimates therefore may prove inaccurate.\nRecurring revenue opportunity under management (\u201copportunity under management\u201d) is a forward-looking metric and is our estimate, as of a given date, of the value of all end customer service contracts that we will have the opportunity to sell on behalf of our customers over the subsequent twelve-month period. Opportunity under management is not a measure of our expected revenue. We estimate the value of such end customer contracts based on a combination of factors, including the value of end-customer contracts made available to us by customers in past periods; the minimum value of end-customer contracts that our customers are required to give us the opportunity to sell pursuant to the terms of their contracts with us; periodic internal business reviews of our expectations as to the value of end customer contracts that will be made available to us by customers; the value of end customer contracts included in the SPA; and collaborative discussions with our customers assessing their expectations as to the value of service contracts that they will make available to us for sale. While the minimum value of end customer contracts that our customers are required to give us represents a portion of our estimated opportunity under management, a significant portion of the opportunity under management is estimated based on the other factors described above.\nWhen estimating recurring revenue opportunity under management and other similar metrics, we must, to a large degree, rely on the assumptions described above, which may prove incorrect. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Our estimates therefore may prove inaccurate, causing the actual value of end customer contracts delivered to us in a given twelve-month period to differ from our estimate of opportunity under management. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which customers deliver a greater or lesser value of end customer contracts than may be required or otherwise expected;\n\u2022\nroll-overs of unsold service contract renewals from prior periods to the current period or future periods;\n\u2022\nchanges in the pricing or terms of service contracts offered by our customers;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in the end customer base of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the renewal rates we achieve on behalf of a customer early in an engagement affect the amount of opportunity that the customer makes available to us later in the engagement;\n\u2022\ncustomer cancellations of their contracts with us due to acquisitions or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers\u2019 businesses, sales organizations, sales processes or priorities, including changes in executive support for our partnership.\nIn addition, opportunity under management reflects our estimate for a forward twelve-month period and should not be used to estimate our opportunity for any particular quarter within that period.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail, resulting in unauthorized access to customer data, our solution may be perceived as insecure, the attractiveness of our solution to current or potential customers may be reduced and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur solution involves the storage and transmission of the proprietary information and protected data that we receive from our customers. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as other processes, to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of such information. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee negligence, error, malfeasance or otherwise, unauthorized access to customer or end customer data may occur. Improper activities by third parties, advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a compromise or breach of our computer systems. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or\nimplement adequate protective measures. Our security measures may not be effective in preventing these types of activities, and the security measures of our third-party data centers and service providers may not be adequate.\nOur customer contracts generally provide that we will indemnify our customers for data privacy breaches. If such a breach occurs, we could face contractual damages, damages and fees arising from our indemnification obligations, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, possible lawsuits by affected individuals and significant remediation costs and efforts to prevent future occurrences. In addition, whether there is an actual or a perceived breach of our security, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed significantly and we could lose current or potential customers.\nWe may be liable to our customers or third parties if we make errors in providing our solution or fail to properly safeguard our customers' confidential information.\nThe solution we offer is complex, and we make errors from time to time. These may include human errors made in the course of managing the sales process for our customers as we interact with their end customers, or errors arising from our technology solution as it interacts with our customers\u2019 systems and the disparate data contained on such systems. Errors may also arise from the launch of and migration of our current offerings to the cloud offerings. The costs incurred in correcting any material errors may be substantial. In addition, as part of our business, we collect, process and analyze confidential information provided by our customers and prospective customers. Although we take significant steps to safeguard the confidentiality of customer information, we could be subject to claims that we disclosed their information without appropriate authorization or used their information inappropriately. Any claims based on errors or unauthorized disclosure or use of information could subject us to exposure for damages, significant legal defense costs, adverse publicity and reputational harm, regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such claims.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively against current and future competitors, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe market for service revenue management is evolving. Historically, technology companies have managed their service renewals through internal personnel and relied upon technology ranging from Excel spreadsheets to internally-developed software to customized versions of traditional business intelligence tools and CRM or ERP software from vendors such as Oracle Corporation, SAP AG, Salesforce.com, Inc. and NetSuite, Inc. Some companies have made further investments in this area using firms such as Accenture, Plc. and McKinsey & Company, Inc. for technology consulting and education services focused on service renewals. These internally-developed solutions represent the primary alternative to our offerings. We also face direct competition from smaller companies that offer specialized service revenue management solutions, typically providing technology for use by their customers\u2019 internal sales personnel. With our acquisition of Scout Analytics in January 2014, we also face competition from other SaaS and enterprise software providers and service providers that offer products and services that analyze recurring revenue management.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:\n\u2022\nrecurring revenue industry expertise, best practices, and benchmarks;\n\u2022\nquality and reliability of software offerings, including convenience and efficacy of cloud-based offerings;\n\u2022\nmarketing resources and capabilities;\n\u2022\nperformance-based pricing of solutions;\n\u2022\nability to increase recurring revenue, renewal rates, and close rates;\n\u2022\nglobal capabilities;\n\u2022\ncompleteness of solution;\n\u2022\nability to effectively represent customer brands to end customers and channel partners;\n\u2022\nsize of upfront investment; and\n\u2022\nsize and financial stability of operations.\nWe believe that more competitors will emerge. With respect to our cloud offerings, we are seeing competition from companies targeting product usage, renewals and customer success related offerings. Competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, well-established relationships with customers in our markets and substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we have, and even a potentially broader array of offerings. Potential competitors of any size may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer or end customer requirements. Even if our solution is more effective than competing solutions, potential customers might choose new entrants unless we can convince them of the advantages of our integrated solution. We expect competition and competitive pressure, from both new and existing competitors, to increase in the future.\nIf there is a widespread shift away from business customers purchasing maintenance and support service contracts, we could be adversely impacted if we are not able to adapt to new trends or expand our target markets.\nAs a result of our historical concentration in the software and hardware industries, a significant portion of our revenue comes from the sale of maintenance and support service contracts for the software and hardware products used by our customers\u2019 end customers. Although we also sell other types of renewals, such as subscriptions to software-as-a-service offerings, those sales have to date constituted a relatively small portion of our revenue. The emergence of cloud computing and other alternative technology purchasing models, in which technology services are provided on a remote-access basis, may have a significant impact on the size of the market for traditional maintenance and support contracts. If these alternative models continue gaining traction and reduce the size of our traditional market, we will need to continue to adapt our solution to capitalize on these trends or our results of operations will suffer.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we cannot scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unsuccessful in implementing our business plan.\nAnticipated growth in our customer base will place a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We expect that additional investments in sales personnel, information technology, infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to:\n\u2022\nfurther develop and enhance our offerings;\n\u2022\naddress the needs of our customers;\n\u2022\nscale our operations and increase productivity;\n\u2022\ndevelop new technology; and\n\u2022\nexpand our markets and opportunity under management, including into new industry verticals and geographic areas.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures, and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. These additional investments will increase our operating costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. Moreover, if we fail to scale our operations successfully and increase productivity, our overall business will be at risk.\nConsolidation in the technology sector is continuing at a rapid pace, which could harm our business in the event that our customers are acquired and their contracts are cancelled.\nConsolidation among technology companies in our target market has been robust in recent years, and this trend poses a risk for us. Acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers by the acquiring companies and could reduce the number of our existing and potential customers. For example, Oracle has acquired a number of our customers in recent years, including our then-largest customer, Sun Microsystems, in January 2010. Oracle elected to terminate our service contracts with each customer because Oracle conducted its service revenue management internally. If mergers and acquisitions continue, we expect that some of the acquiring companies, and Oracle in particular, will terminate, renegotiate and/or elect not to renew our contracts with the companies they acquire, which would reduce our revenue.\nWe enter into long-term, commission-based contracts with our customers, and our failure to correctly price these contracts may negatively affect our profitability.\nWe enter into long-term contracts with our customers that are priced based on multiple factors determined in large part by the SPA we conduct for our customers. These factors include opportunity size, anticipated close rates and expected commission rates at various levels of sales performance. Some of these factors require forward-looking assumptions that may prove incorrect. If our assumptions are inaccurate, or if we otherwise fail to correctly price our customer contracts, particularly those with lengthy contract terms, then our revenue, profitability and overall business operations may suffer. Further, if we fail to anticipate any unexpected increase in our cost of providing services, including the costs for employees, office space or technology, we could be exposed to risks associated with cost overruns related to our required performance under our contracts, which could have a negative effect on our margins and earnings.\nMany of our customer contracts allow termination for our failure to meet certain performance conditions.\nAlthough most of our customer contracts are subject to multi-year terms, these agreements often have termination rights if we fail to meet specified sales targets. During the SPA and contract negotiation phase with a customer, we typically negotiate\nminimum performance levels for the engagement. If we fail to meet our required targets and our customers choose to exercise their termination rights, our revenue could decline. These termination rights may also create instability in our revenue forecasts and other forward-looking financial metrics.\nOur business may be harmed if our customers rely upon our service revenue forecasts in their business and actual results are materially different.\nThe contracts that we enter into with our customers provide for sharing of information with respect to forecasts and plans for the renewal of maintenance, support and subscription agreements of our customers. Our customers may use such forecasted data for a variety of purposes related to their business. Our forecasts are based upon the data our customers provide to us, and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forecasted expectations are based upon historical trends and data that may not be true in subsequent periods. Any material inaccuracies related to these forecasts could lead to claims on the part of our customers related to the accuracy of the forecasted data we provide to them, or the appropriateness of our methodology. Any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of inaccuracies in the forecasted data we provide to our customers could impact our ability to retain existing customers and harm our business.\nChanging global economic conditions and large scale economic shifts may impact our business.\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions that impact the technology sector and other technology-enabled industries such as healthcare, life sciences and industrial systems. For example, the economic downturn typically results in many businesses deferring technology investments, including purchases of new software, hardware and other equipment, and purchases of additional or supplemental maintenance, support and subscription services. To a certain extent, these businesses also slow the rate of renewals of maintenance, support and subscription services for their existing technology base. Any future downturn could cause business customers to stop renewing their existing maintenance, support and subscription agreements or contracting for additional maintenance services as they look for ways to further cut expenses, in which case our business could suffer.\nConversely, a significant upturn in global economic conditions could cause business purchasers to purchase new hardware, software and other technology products, which we generally do not sell, instead of renewing or otherwise purchasing maintenance, support and subscription services for their existing products. A general shift toward new product sales could reduce our near term opportunities for these contracts, which could lead to a decline in our revenue.\nOur inability to expand our target markets could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from customers in certain sectors in the technology and technology-enabled healthcare and life sciences industries, and an important part of our strategy is to expand our existing customer base and win new customers in these industries. In addition, because of the service revenue opportunities that we believe exist beyond these industries, we intend to target new customers in additional industry vertical markets, such as technology-enabled building services. In connection with the expansion of our target markets, we may not have familiarity with such additional industry verticals, and our execution of such expansion could face risks where our experience base is less developed within a particular new vertical. We may encounter customers in these previously untapped markets that have different pricing and other business sensitivities than we are used to managing. As a result of these and other factors, our efforts to expand our solution to additional industry vertical markets may not succeed, may divert management resources from our existing operations and may require us to commit significant financial resources to unproven parts of our business, all of which may harm our financial performance.\nA substantial portion of our business consists of supporting our customers\u2019 channel partners in the sale of service contracts. If those channel partners become unreceptive to our solution, our business could be harmed.\nMany of our customers, including some of our largest customers, sell service contracts through their channel partners and engage our solution to help those channel partners become more effective at selling service contract renewals. These channel partners may have access to some of our cloud offerings, such as our Channel Sales Cloud, in addition to other sales support services we provide. In this context, the ultimate buyers of the service contracts are end customers of those channel partners, who then receive the actual services from our customers. In the event our customers\u2019 channel partners become unreceptive to our involvement in the renewals process, those channel partners could discourage our current or future customers from engaging our solution to support channel sales. This risk is compounded by the fact that large channel partners may have relationships with more than one of our customers or prospects, in which case the negative reaction of one or more of those large channel partners could impact multiple customer relationships. Accordingly, with respect to those customers and\nprospective customers who sell service contracts through channel partners, any significant resistance to our solution by their channel partners could harm our ability to attract or retain customers, which would damage our overall business operations.\nWe face long sales cycles to secure new customer contracts, making it difficult to predict the timing of specific new customer relationships.\nWe face a variable selling cycle to secure new customer agreements, typically spanning a number of months and requiring our effort to obtain and analyze our prospect\u2019s business through the SPA, for which we are not paid. We recently have also experienced a lengthening of our sales cycles reflecting the hiring of a number of new sales personnel in the past eighteen months who are new to selling our solution as well as slower decision making by a few end customers as well as other end customers considering renewals of large, multi-year contracts. This has adversely affected the conversion rates of new customer contracts. Moreover, even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, the scope of the potential subscription or service revenue management engagement frequently changes over the course of the business discussions and, for a variety of reasons, our sales discussions may fail to result in new customer acquisitions. Consequently, we have only a limited ability to predict the timing and size of specific new customer relationships.\nIf we fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts or experience significant fluctuations in our business, our results could be harmed and we may need to raise additional capital.\nDue to our evolving business model, the uncertain size of our markets and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we expect to continue to require significant capital and may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue and operating needs. We require a significant amount of cash resources to operate our business. We plan our expense levels and investments based on estimates of future sales performance for our customers with respect to their end customers, future revenue and future customer acquisition. If our assumptions prove incorrect, we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to offset the resulting decline in growth and revenue. Consequently, we expect that our gross margins, operating margins and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we may need to raise additional capital in order to meet operating and capital expenditure requirements. Any decline in our customer renewals or termination of our ongoing engagements may result in higher than anticipated losses in the future and shorten the time before we would need to raise additional capital. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we raise cash through additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business.\nIf we continue to see turnover of our top executives, or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel and other necessary employees, our business will be harmed.\nOur future success depends on the continued contributions of our executives, each of whom may be difficult to replace. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified service sales personnel, sales representatives and management- level employees to oversee such sales forces in addition to marketing, research and development and general and administrative personnel to support our global operation. We have experienced increased turnover in key executive positions during the last twelve months, including our chief executive officer. The loss of any of our key executives, or our inability to continue to attract and retain high-quality talent, could harm our business.\nBecause competition for our target employees is intense, we may be unable to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.\nTo continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified sales representatives, engineers and other key employees in the markets in which we have operations. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for highly educated, qualified sales representatives. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled key employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock may make attracting and retaining our employees more difficult given the competitive compensatory environment we face recruiting technology employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. If we fail to attract new sales representatives, engineers and other key employees, or fail to retain and motivate our most successful employees, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nThe length of time it takes our newly-hired sales representatives to become productive could adversely impact our success rate, the execution of our overall business plan and our costs.\nIt can take twelve months or longer before our internal sales representatives are fully trained and productive in selling our solution to prospective customers. This long ramp period presents a number of operational challenges as the cost of recruiting,\nhiring and carrying new sales representatives cannot be offset by the revenue such new sales representatives produce until after they complete their long ramp periods. Further, given the length of the ramp period, we often cannot determine if a sales representative will succeed until he or she has been employed for a year or more. If we cannot reliably develop our sales representatives to a productive level, or if we lose productive representatives in whom we have heavily invested, our future growth rates and revenue will suffer.\nWe depend on revenue from sources outside the United States, and our international business operations and expansion plans are subject to risks related to international operations, and may not increase our revenue growth or enhance our business operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 35% of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. As a result of our continued focus on international markets, we expect that revenue derived from international sources will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue.\nA portion of the sales commissions earned from our international customers is paid in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in the value of these foreign currencies may make our solution more expensive or cause resulting fluctuations in cost for international customers, which could harm our business. We currently do not undertake hedging activities to manage these currency fluctuations. In addition, if the effective price of the contracts we sell to end customers were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for such contracts could fall, which in turn would reduce our revenue.\nOur growth strategy includes further expansion into international markets. Our international expansion may require significant additional financial resources and management attention, and could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. In addition, we may be exposed to associated risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to localize and adapt our solution for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for our intellectual property than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing our rights abroad;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ncompliance obligations related to multiple, conflicting and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional economic and political conditions.\nWe cannot assure you we will succeed in creating additional international demand for our solution or that we will be able to effectively sell service agreements in the international markets we enter.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, and greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws, regulations and stock exchange listing requirements pertaining to public companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishing effective internal controls and certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives, and additional laws and regulations may divert further management resources. Moreover, if we are not able to meet new compliance requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to investigations and other actions by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWhile we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from\nsuch evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. The report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management.\nWe monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting, and if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at year-end, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at such time. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at year-end (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nChanges in the U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including those relating to privacy, data security and cross-border data flows, could pose a significant risk to us by disrupting our business and increasing our expenses.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices with resultant increases in costs and decreases in profitability. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through new legislation, the issuance of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Sometimes those changes have both prospective and retroactive effect, which is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time.\nPrivacy and data security are rapidly evolving areas of regulation, and additional regulation in those areas, some of it potentially difficult and costly for us to accommodate, is frequently proposed and occasionally adopted. Laws in many countries and jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union and Canada, govern the requirements related to how we store, transfer or otherwise process the private data provided to us by our customers. In addition, the centralized nature of our information systems at the data and operations centers that we use requires the routine flow of data relating to our customers and their respective end customers across national borders, both with respect to the jurisdictions within which we have operations and the jurisdictions in which we provide services to our customers. If this flow of data becomes subject to new or different restrictions, our ability to serve our customers and their respective customers could be seriously impaired for an extended period of time. For example, we participate in the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Framework to govern our treatment of data and data flow with respect to our customers and their respective customers across various jurisdictions. We also have entered into various model contracts and related contractual provisions to enable these data flows. For any jurisdictions in which these measures are not recognized or otherwise not compliant with the laws of the countries in which we process data, or where more stringent data privacy laws are enacted irrespective of international treaty arrangements or other existing compliance mechanisms, we could face increased compliance expenses and face penalties for violating such laws or be excluded from those markets altogether, in which case our operations could be materially damaged.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and our business may suffer.\nWe rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law and contractual terms to protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. If we fail to protect or effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, others may be able to compete against us using intellectual property that is the same as or similar to our own. In addition, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage against others who offer services similar to ours.\nWhile we have filed patent applications to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that any patents will issue or that any issued patents arising from our applications will provide the protection we seek, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Also, we cannot assure you that we will obtain any copyright or trademark registrations from our pending or future applications or that any of our trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. We also rely in some circumstances on trade secrets to protect our technology.\nTrade secrets may lose their value if not properly protected. We endeavor to enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors and business partners to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary technology. However, trade secret protection does not prevent others from reverse engineering or independently developing similar technologies. In addition, reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our trade secrets could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying for it.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property and using our technology for their competitive advantage. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Monitoring infringement of our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly, and enforcement of our intellectual property rights may require us to bring legal actions against infringers. Infringement actions are inherently uncertain and therefore may not be successful, even when claims are meritorious. Even if such actions are successful, they may require a substantial amount of resources and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nClaims by others that we infringe or violate their intellectual property could force us to incur significant costs and require us to change the way we conduct our business.\nNumerous technology companies including potential competitors protect their intellectual property rights by means such as patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. We have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties. Additionally, because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are kept confidential for some period of time before they are published, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our proprietary technology. From time to time we may receive letters from other parties alleging, or inquiring about, possible breaches of their intellectual property rights.\nAny party asserting that we infringe its proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves, and possibly our customers, against the alleged infringement. The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, the risk of such a lawsuit will likely increase as we become larger, the scope of our solution and technology expands and the number of competitors in our market increases. Any such claims or litigation could:\n\u2022\nbe time-consuming and expensive to defend, and deplete our financial resources, whether meritorious or not;\n\u2022\nrequire us to stop providing the services that use the technology that infringes the other party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndivert the attention of our technical and managerial resources away from our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties, which may not be available on terms that we deem acceptable, if at all;\n\u2022\nprevent us from operating all or a portion of our business or force us to redesign our technology, which could be difficult and expensive and may make the performance or value of our solution less attractive;\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant liability for damages or result in significant settlement payments; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to indemnify our customers as we are required by contract to indemnify some of our customers for certain claims based upon the infringement or alleged infringement of any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights resulting from our customers\u2019 use of our intellectual property.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. Disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could harm us. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could significantly limit our ability to continue our operations and could harm our relationships with current and prospective customers. Any of the foregoing could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may incorporate open source software into our technology solution. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our commercialization of any of our solutions that may include open source software. As a result, we will be required to analyze and monitor our use of open source software closely. As a result of the use of open source software, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to develop such future products, re-engineer our products, discontinue sales of our solutions or release our software code under the terms of an open source license to the public. Given the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on any use of such open source software, as more generally discussed with respect to general intellectual property claims.\nVarious risks could affect our worldwide operations, including numerous events outside of our control, exposing us to significant costs that could adversely affect our operations and customer confidence.\nWe conduct operations throughout the world, including our headquarters in the United States and operations in Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events, including local inflation or economic downturn, currency exchange fluctuations, political turmoil, labor issues, terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics. Any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our solution or meet our contractual obligations, the cost of our solution, customer satisfaction, our ability to attract or maintain customers, and, ultimately, our profits.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our solution to our customers, and could decrease demand for our solution. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we may not have insurance coverage that would cover quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These events could adversely affect our customers\u2019 levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles.\nThe technology we currently use may not operate properly, which could damage our reputation, give rise to claims against us or divert application of our resources from other purposes, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nThe technology we currently use, which includes our cloud offerings may contain or develop unexpected defects or errors. There can be no assurance that performance problems or defects in our technology will not arise in the future. Errors may result from receipt, entry or interpretation of customer or end customer information or from the interface of our technology with legacy systems and data that are outside of our control. Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our solution. Any defects and errors that we discover in our technology and any failure by us to identify and effectively address them could result in loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, and increased costs. Defects or errors in our technology may discourage existing or potential customers from contracting with us. Correction of defects or errors could prove impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nDisruptions in service or damage to the data center that hosts our data and our locations could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our data servers and cloud applications, which are located in data centers operated for us by third parties. We cannot control or assure the continued or uninterrupted availability of these third-party data centers. In addition, our information technologies and systems, as well as our data center, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism and power losses, computer systems failures, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses of and corruption of data and similar events. Although we conduct business continuity planning and maintain certain insurance for certain events, the situations for which we plan, and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain, may prove inadequate in any particular case. In addition, the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in the delivery of the solutions we offer to our customers. Any of these events could impair or prohibit our ability to provide our solution, reduce the attractiveness of our solution to current or potential customers and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, data centers, operations and other centers or systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical intrusions, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks by third parties.\nAny failure or interruptions in the Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties or our own systems for providing our solution to customers, and changes in the terms and conditions of third-party platform providers, could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to deliver our solution is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. Such services include maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telecommunications systems that connect our global operations. As we plan to transition to a Salesforce based platform for certain of our solutions, we will rely on Salesforce to make application programming interfaces publicly available in order to enable customer integrations with our platform. In addition, any deterioration in our relationship with Salesforce could adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile our solution is designed to operate without interruption, we have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party vendors, including data center, bandwidth, and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our solution. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with our customers.\nAdditional government regulations may reduce the size of the market for our solution, harm demand for our solution and increase our costs of doing business.\nAny changes in government regulations that impact our customers or their end customers could have a harmful effect on our business by reducing the size of our addressable market or otherwise increasing our costs. For example, with respect to our technology-enabled healthcare and life sciences customers, any change in U.S. Food and Drug Administration or foreign equivalent regulation of, or denial, withholding or withdrawal of approval of, our customers\u2019 products could lead to a lack of demand for service revenue management with respect to such products. Other changes in government regulations, in areas such as privacy, export compliance or anti-bribery statutes, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could require us to implement changes in our services or operations that increase our cost of doing business and thereby hurt our financial performance.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based applications such as ours and reduce the demand for our solution.\nWe operate and offer our services in many jurisdictions and, therefore, may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes that could harm our business.\nWe operate service sales centers in multiple locations. Some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Ireland, give us the benefit of either relatively low tax rates, tax holidays or government grants, in each case, that are dependent on how we operate or how many jobs we create and employees we retain. We plan on utilizing such tax incentives in the future as opportunities are made available to us. Any failure on our part to operate in conformity with applicable requirements to remain qualified for any such tax incentives or grants may result in an increase in our taxes. In addition, jurisdictions may choose to increase rates at any time due to economic or other factors, such as the current economic situation in Ireland. Any such rate increases may harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may lose sales or incur significant costs should various tax jurisdictions impose taxes on either a broader range of services or services that we have performed in the past. We may be subject to audits of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business that would require us to incur costs in responding to such audits. Imposition of such taxes on our services could result in substantial unplanned costs, would effectively increase the cost of such services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nAs we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in companies, services and technologies that we believe to be complementary. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and acquiring technologies or businesses that will help our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n\u2022\nrisks related to the assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential litigation by third parties, such as claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed;\n\u2022\nthe risk of write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer engagements due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u2022\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022\nharm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe key personnel of the acquired entity or business may decide not to work for us or may not perform according to our expectations; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash or dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt to consummate the acquisition.\nWe may record impairment charges related to our acquisitions or strategic investments. In assessing goodwill for impairment, we make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates and assumptions about market penetration, anticipated growth rates and risk-adjusted discount rates based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and industry data. The estimates and assumptions used by management have a high degree of subjectivity and require significant judgment on the part of management. Changes in estimates and assumptions in the context of our impairment testing may have a material impact on us. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to acquisitions or strategic investments may have a negative impact on our financial results, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to acquisitions or strategic investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.\nAs a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\nWe may be exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may be party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Such litigation may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions initiated by us, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from any claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices. Our business and technology acquisition activity could also result in litigation in connection with such acquired companies. For example, refer to Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which discusses some ongoing litigation related to our acquisition of Scout Analytics, Inc.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock and Capitalization Matters\nOur share price has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. In addition to the risks described in this section, factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us as discussed in more detail elsewhere in these \u201cRisk Factors;\u201d\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve our revenue or earnings expectations, or those of investors or analysts, such as we experienced for the first quarter of 2014;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us;\n\u2022\nvolatility inherent in prices of technology company stocks;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity;\n\u2022\nthe volume of trading in our common stock, including sales upon exercise of outstanding options;\n\u2022\nsales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks or natural disasters or other such events impacting countries where we or our customers have operations; and\n\u2022\nactual or perceived changes in general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class actions filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it would likely result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur actual results may differ significantly from any guidance that we may issue in the future.\nFrom time to time, we may release financial guidance or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represent our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. If given, this guidance will be based on forecasts prepared by our management. These forecasts are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published accounting guidelines, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the forecasts and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to such forecasts. The principal reason that we may release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any third persons. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance furnished by us may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, over 25% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these stockholders will have substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval, with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nclassifying our board of directors, staggered into three classes, only one of which is elected at each annual meeting;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding common stock to merge or combine with us.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, by laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nCampaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through various corporate actions. We have recently seen some activist investors take ownership positions in our common stock. Altai Capital Management is the beneficial owner of approximately 14% of our common stock, has a representative on our board and has entered into a letter agreement and registration rights agreement with us governing various rights and obligations. As a general matter, if we become engaged in a proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future, our business could be adversely affected as such contests could be costly and time consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our strategic plan. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or changes to the composition of our board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential buyers and sellers on our platform, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If buyers and/or sellers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or through our platform or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our revenue, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If any of these analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price and trading volume of our stock could be negatively impacted. If analysts downgrade our stock or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would also likely decline.\nWe are leveraged financially, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future growth, business needs and development plans.\nWe have substantial existing indebtedness. In August 2013, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes. We also have entered into a credit agreement providing for a secured revolving line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable of up to $10.0 million, with a $2.0 million letter of credit sublimit, under which we had amounts outstanding at December 31, 2014 consisting solely of a letter of credit for $0.6 million.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make cash payments upon any conversion of the convertible notes, which would reduce our cash on hand.\nA failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our outstanding convertible notes and credit facilities. We have in the past been able to obtain waivers from our lender under our credit agreement for our failure to comply with certain financial covenants, including our failure to comply with the consolidated funded debt to EBITDA ratio for the quarters ended June 30,\n2014 and September 30, 2014. In addition, on November 3, 2014, we entered into Amendment 5 to the credit agreement to, among other things, amend certain financial covenants under the credit agreement. We may not be able to obtain waivers or enter into further amendments to our credit agreement in the future, and the failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement could result in a lack of availability for borrowing under the credit facility or events of default, which could permit acceleration of repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement, and may lead to a cross default under any other outstanding indebtedness.\nAny required repurchase of the convertible notes as a result of a fundamental change or acceleration of the convertible notes would reduce our cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nConversion of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of then-existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. In addition, convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. During the third quarter of 2014 the value of our common stock declined and we experienced slowing revenue growth, which led us to perform an impairment analysis. Based on the outcome of this analysis, we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $21.0 million during the third quarter of 2014 and subsequently in the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred an additional goodwill impairment charge of $1.7 million which together eliminated all of the $22.7 million of goodwill in the Cloud and Business Intelligence (\u201cCBI\u201d) segment. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we had a change in strategy for part of the CBI segment which resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million of certain intangible assets from the Scout Analytics acquisition. If in any future period the Company\u2019s market capitalization declines, this could indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period against any remaining goodwill or other long-live assets.", "PERMNO": 12640, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SREV"}
