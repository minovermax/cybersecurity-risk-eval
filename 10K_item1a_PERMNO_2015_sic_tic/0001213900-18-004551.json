{"cik": "1040792", "company": "Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks that we may face or that could adversely affect us. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nWe changed our primary business to the integration and development of MoviePass.\nSince the completion of our acquisition of a majority of the ownership interest of MoviePass Inc., we have primarily focused our resources and business activities towards the integration and development of the MoviePass business. It is possible that we may not achieve profitability with our MoviePass business.\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nThe report of our independent auditors on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors\u2019 doubts are based on our incurring significant net losses and our working capital position. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to obtain additional funding in the short term to enable us to continue the development and integration of our MoviePass business.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR MOVIEPASS BUSINESS\nIf we fail to successfully integrate MoviePass into our internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised which could result in a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.\nAs a private company, MoviePass was not subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to internal control over financial reporting. The integration of MoviePass into our internal control over financial reporting may require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs. If we fail to successfully integrate these operations, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results and the market\u2019s perception of our business and stock price.\nMoviePass has incurred losses since inception. To continue to support the business objectives of MoviePass, we have a present need for additional funding, which may be unavailable to us.\nMoviePass has incurred losses since its inception and has a present need for additional funding. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. For the foreseeable future, MoviePass expects to fund its operations from additional debt or equity offerings and increased revenue from MoviePass subscribers and ancillary revenue streams. If MoviePass cannot raise additional short-term capital, it may consume all of its cash needed for operations and, as a result, the expenditures of the Company involved in supporting MoviePass may consume a significant amount of the Company\u2019s cash needed for other operations and business objectives. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of the Company\u2019s planned growth or otherwise alter our business objectives and operations, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoviePass has a limited operating history and history of net losses, and it is likely that they will experience net losses for the foreseeable future.\nMoviePass has experienced significant net losses since inception and, given the significant operating and capital expenditures associated with its business plans, anticipate continuing to incur net losses and significant negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. If MoviePass ever does achieve profitability, of which no assurances can be given, MoviePass may be unable to sustain or increase such profitability.\nTo achieve and sustain profitability, MoviePass, will need to accomplish numerous objectives, including substantially increasing the number of paying subscribers to its service and securing additional sources of revenue and economies of scale. There is a significant risk that MoviePass will be unable to achieve these objectives, which would damage MoviePass\u2019 business and could lead to the loss of the Company\u2019s investment in MoviePass.\nFurther, MoviePass currently spends more to retain a subscriber than the revenue derived from that subscriber and MoviePass other sources of revenue are currently inadequate to offset or exceed the costs of subscriber retention. This results in a negative gross profit margin. MoviePass expects its negative gross profit margin to remain significant until MoviePass can sufficiently increase its other sources of revenues to offset the losses or achieve substantial economies of scale. There is no assurance that MoviePass will be able to sufficiently increase its other sources of revenue or be able to achieve economies of scale that would reduce the cost of revenue sufficiently to generate a positive gross profit margin. Failure to achieve positive gross profit margin in the foreseeable future could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIncreased monthly usage by MoviePass\u2019 subscribers will cause it to incur losses and negative cash flow.\nMoviePass\u2019 current monthly subscription pricing plans allow subscribers to see a new movie each day for the entire month. In most cases, MoviePass pays the theaters the full cost for each movie ticket that a subscriber uses. Accordingly, increased movie viewing by subscribers results in significant and increasing losses per subscriber and negative cash flow and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoviePass may not gain acceptance from large national exhibitors (movie theater chains), which could have a material adverse effect on MoviePass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nMoviePass has historically paid large national exhibitors full price for each ticket purchased by a MoviePass subscriber through the MoviePass application (though in the past, MoviePass has received as much as a 20% discount on movie tickets for its subscribers from a small group of exhibitor partners). Additionally, MoviePass has not historically received a benefit from any large national exhibitors for driving MoviePass subscribers to their theaters (for example, in the form of a portion of concession sales). MoviePass anticipates negotiating discounts on movie tickets and receiving a portion of concession sales to its subscribers attending theaters operated by those exhibitor partners. However, if MoviePass is unable to partner with large national exhibitors, (i) MoviePass likely will continue to be required to pay full price per movie ticket each time a MoviePass subscriber attends a movie theater operated by a large national exhibitor, (ii) MoviePass would be unlikely to share in concession sales to its subscribers attending those theaters, and (iii) MoviePass may not be able to sell digital advertising or data analytics services to those large national exhibitors. If MoviePass is unable to negotiate discounted ticket prices from, share in concession sales with or sell digital advertising or data analytics services to large national exhibitors, MoviePass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, MoviePass may not become profitable and MoviePass may not be able to sustain its operations.\nMoviePass may not gain acceptance from large movie studios, which could have a material adverse effect on MoviePass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nMoviePass\u2019 success will depend, in part, on deriving revenue from sales of digital advertising and data analytics services to large movie studios. However, if MoviePass is unable to gain acceptance from large national exhibitors (movie theater chains), upon which large movie studios depend to distribute and exhibit their movies, then large movie studios may refrain from purchasing digital advertising or data analytics services from MoviePass. If MoviePass is unable to derive revenue from selling digital advertising or data analytics services to large movie studios, MoviePass\u2019 financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, MoviePass may not become profitable and MoviePass may not be able to sustain its operations.\nIf MoviePass is not able to manage its growth, its business could be affected adversely.\nMoviePass\u2019 subscriber base has expanded rapidly since August 15, 2017, when it announced its new subscription price of $9.95 per month. MoviePass may not be able, for many reasons, including lack of financing or adequate personnel resources, to meet the demand to timely deliver MoviePass cards to its subscribers or otherwise service its business. As such, MoviePass could experience a significant slowdown or stoppage as it attempts to serve the expanding subscriber base.\nMoviePass anticipates that further expansion of its operations will be required to address any significant growth in its subscriber base and to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. Any future expansion will likely place significant demands on its managerial, operational, administrative and financial resources. If it is not able to respond effectively to new or increased demands that arise because of MoviePass\u2019 growth, or, if in responding, MoviePass\u2019 management is materially distracted from current operations, MoviePass\u2019 business may be affected adversely.\nMoviePass\u2019 ability to develop and implement new and updated features and services may be more difficult than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.\nAttracting and retaining subscribers requires MoviePass to continue to improve the technology underlying its applications and to continue to develop new and updated features, services and applications. If MoviePass is unable to do so on a timely basis, or if it\u2019s unable to implement new features and services without disrupting its existing applications, MoviePass may lose current and potential subscribers. MoviePass relies on a combination of internal development, strategic relationships and licensing to develop its service offering and related features. The development and implementation of new technologies, features and services may cost more than expected, may take longer than originally expected, may require more testing than originally anticipated, or may require the acquisition of additional personnel, technology and other resources. There can be no assurance that MoviePass\u2019 revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts spent.\nMoviePass\u2019 success depends on its ability to maintain the value of its brand. If events occur that damage its brand, MoviePass\u2019 business and financial results may be harmed.\nMoviePass\u2019 success depends on its ability to maintain the value of its brand. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning the MoviePass brand will depend largely on the success of its marketing efforts and its ability to provide consistent, high quality products and services through its applications. The MoviePass brand could be harmed if MoviePass fails to achieve these objectives or if its public image or brand were to be tarnished by negative publicity. MoviePass\u2019 reputation and brand may be harmed if it fails to maintain a consistently high level of customer service. Executing the strategies necessary to maintain the value of its brand may require MoviePass to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. Such failures may adversely affect MoviePass\u2019 business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny material disruption or breach of MoviePass\u2019 information technology systems or those of third-party partners could materially damage subscriber and business partner relationships, and could subject MoviePass to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the servers of MoviePass\u2019 computing providers and other systems, and other third parties on which MoviePass relies on, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any material disruption or slowdown of MoviePass\u2019 systems or those of third parties on which MoviePass depends on, including a disruption or slowdown caused by MoviePass\u2019 failure to successfully manage significant increases in subscriber volume or successfully upgrade applicable systems, system failures, viruses, security breaches, or other causes, could harm MoviePass\u2019 brand and reputation, and cause revenues to decline. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, MoviePass could incur liability and the further development of products and services could be delayed. In addition, if changes in technology cause MoviePass\u2019 information systems, or those of third parties on which MoviePass depends on, to become obsolete, or if such information systems are inadequate to handle MoviePass\u2019 growth, MoviePass could lose subscribers and its business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf MoviePass\u2019 efforts to attract and service subscribers are not successful, its revenues and results of operations will be affected adversely.\nMoviePass must continue to attract, retain and grow the number of its subscribers. To succeed, it must continue to attract a large number of subscribers who have traditionally used online and pay cable channels, such as Netflix, HBO and Showtime, and pay-per-view and video-on-demand as opposed to attending movie theaters. MoviePass\u2019 ability to attract and retain subscribers will depend in part on its ability to consistently provide subscribers a high quality experience for purchasing passes and viewing movies in theaters. If consumers do not perceive MoviePass\u2019 service offering to be of high quality, or if MoviePass introduces new services that are not favorably received by customers, it may not be able to attract or retain subscribers. If its efforts to satisfy its existing subscribers are not successful, MoviePass may not be able to attract new subscribers, and as a result, its revenue and results of operations will be affected adversely.\nIf MoviePass is unable to compete effectively, its business will be affected adversely.\nThe market for filmed entertainment ticketing services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. MoviePass may experience competition that could negatively affect demand for MoviePass\u2019 service or ability to be accepted at certain theater chains. Current potential competitors include Atom Tickets, MovieTickets.com, Fandango as well as potential exhibitors offering their own subscription services.\nMany consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple filmed entertainment ticketing providers and can easily shift spending from one provider to another. If MoviePass is unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors and technologies, it may not be able to achieve adequate market share, increase its revenues, or achieve and maintain profitability.\nMany of its competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than MoviePass does. Some of its competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to marketing and website and systems development than MoviePass does. In addition, MoviePass\u2019 competitors may form or extend strategic alliances with studios, exhibitors and distributors that could affect adversely its ability to compete on favorable terms.\nThe loss by MoviePass of one or more of its key personnel, or its failure to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could seriously harm MoviePass\u2019 existing business and new service developments.\nMoviePass depends on the continued services and performance of its key personnel, particularly its Chief Executive Officer Mitch Lowe and other key members of management. In addition, much of MoviePass\u2019 key technology and systems are custom made for its business by its personnel. The loss of MoviePass key managerial and key technology personnel could disrupt its operations and have an adverse effect on its ability to grow and expand its business.\nWe depend on motion picture production and performance.\nOwing to the stability of the monthly subscription model MoviePass has substantially reduced exposure to any short term volatility that may be caused by fluctuations in motion picture production and performance. We do not see a shortage of programming due to the diversity and stability of our subscribers.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment may drive down subscribers and movie goer attendance.\nThe continued disruption resulting from the proliferation of alternative film delivery methods and the overwhelming pressure it has created for all distributors and exhibitors is at the heart of our business model. We know that when we support or create a frequent moviegoer that we are creating value across all platforms. With MoviePass our subscribers have proven that they will dramatically increase the Movie going behavior on a sustained basis. We know that people still love going to the movies despite all of the other options they may have.\nA deterioration in general economic conditions and its impact on consumer and business spending, particularly by customers in our targeted demographic, would adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur business and financial results are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, in particular, those conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending. During past economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures. An economic downturn can result in reduced theater attendance, which could impact subscription renewals.\nFor consumers, such things as employment levels, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact discretionary consumer spending and as a result subscription growth or attrition.\nWe may face difficulty in integrating the operations of the business we have acquired and may acquire in the future.\nAcquisitions have been and may continue to be an important component of our growth strategy; however, we will need to integrate these acquired businesses successfully in order for our growth strategy to succeed and for us to become profitable. We will implement, and the management teams of the acquired businesses will adopt, our policies, procedures and best practices, and cooperate with each other in aspects of their operations. We may face difficulty with the integration of the businesses we acquire, such as coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. The business we acquired is not profitable and does not have sophisticated financial reporting systems in place, and we are relying on their adoption of our best practices to operate their businesses more efficiently to achieve and maintain profitability. However, we may fail in implementing our policies and procedures, or the policies and procedures may not be effective or provide the results we anticipate for a particular business. Further, we will be relying on these policies and procedures in preparing our financial and other reports as a public company, so any failure of acquired businesses to properly adopt these policies and procedures could impair our public reporting. Management of the businesses we acquire may not have the operational or business expertise that we require to successfully implement our policies, procedures and best practices.\nIn addition, our growth strategy also includes the development of online properties that we intend to integrate across all of our businesses. This will require, among other things, the integration of the individual websites and databases of each business we have or will acquire. This will be a complex undertaking that may prove more difficult, expensive and time consuming than we expect. Even if we are able to achieve this integration, it may not achieve the benefits we anticipate. If we fail to do this properly and in a timely manner, it could harm our revenue and relationship with our subscribers.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ZONE BUSINESS\nThe failure to successfully monetize the RedZone Map\u2122 App may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe anticipate that we will be required to invest a significant amount of time and money in developing and monetizing the RedZone Map\u2122 app which, if our efforts are unsuccessful, may not be recovered. To date, we have taken a charge to our profit and loss on our balance sheet of approximately $6.3 million to write down the value of the intangibles related to our Zone acquisition. The failure of consumers to use the RedZone Map\u2122 app may result in the inability to successfully monetize the RedZone Map\u2122 app. Our failure to successfully develop and monetize the RedZone Map app may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nZone faces intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide top quality products and services that are useful to users, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nConsumers have many map application choices like Google Maps and CrimeReports. While we believe that our offering of the RedZone Map\u2122 app is unique given our advanced technology, crime data and navigation tool, there is no assurance that we may continue to incorporate the most advanced mapping and data technologies. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources, which enable them to develop or use superior technologies and develop a user basis for their products and services that we are not able to afford. If our technologies become obsolete, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nNew technologies that block mobile advertising could adversely affect our business.\nZone\u2019s long-term business model depends greatly on advertising revenue derived from fees paid to it by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements. New technologies have been developed, and are likely to continue to be developed, that can block the display of online or mobile advertisements. As a result, advertisement-blocking technology could in the future adversely affect our operating results.\nAny reduction in anticipated spending by advertisers could harm Zone\u2019s business.\nFuture advertising revenues are critical to Zone\u2019s business model and if advertisers\u2019 spending on online or mobile advertising is significantly reduced due to any political, economic, social or technological change or any other reason, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are reliant on crime data from multiple providers. Should we experience difficulty in acquiring that data, our business could be adversely affected.\nShould any of those providers discontinue providing data to us or we otherwise experience disruption in that pipeline, our operations may be adversely affected. If any of those providers require us to pay a much higher fee to use their data in the future that could substantially drive up the costs of our services.\nZone\u2019s business depends on mobile technology and continued, unimpeded access to internet and wireless services. Adverse changes to that access could harm Zone\u2019s business.\nA few large companies provide wireless services to consumers. If our users\u2019 access to Internet and wireless services is interfered with or limited due to any political, economic, social or technological reason, we may not be able to make RedZone Map\u2122 readily available to our users or may not be able to do so in an effective manner, including ensuring that the RedZone Map\u2122 app will remain accessible within an acceptable load time. Failure to provide our services in a timely manner without interruption could generate consumer complaints and adversely affect our business.\nZone\u2019s business model depends on branding and marketing and failure to maintain and expand Zone\u2019s user base or maintain a positive image could harm Zone\u2019s business.\nWe believe that continued marketing efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of Zone\u2019s products. Our marketing campaigns may not be successful given the expense required. For example, failure to adequately maintain and develop our user base could cause our future revenue growth to decrease. In addition, the RedZone Map\u2122 app provides navigation recommendations based on our database so that drivers can choose safer routes. If we are subject to any criticism for inaccurate information or an unsound recommendation and such criticism negatively impacts the public perception of our RedZone Map\u2122, that could harm our revenues and business.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny, in particular, related to privacy and data security issues may negatively impact our business.\nAlthough we are not aware of any current or proposed federal, state or local laws or regulations that would have a material detrimental effect on the RedZone Map\u2122 app or our MoviePass products, there may be increased legal and regulatory scrutiny on our use of data sources, technologies to process data and generate recommendations, the applicability of the recommendations and other aspects of the app. This increased scrutiny may require us to make modifications or improvements to the current technologies we use or may otherwise increase our regulatory compliance costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nIn particular, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues is evolving worldwide and is likely to remain in flux for the foreseeable future. Various government and consumer protection agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices along with increased enforcement of existing laws in the privacy and data security areas. Practices regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, user content, use and security of personal and other information by companies offering online or mobile services is under increased public and regulatory scrutiny. Our business, including our ability to operate and expand in the United States and internationally or on new technology platforms, could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our website, mobile applications, products, features or our privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business will be driven by our ability to responsibly use the data that we collect from our users, key suppliers and other sources. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the storage, use or disclosure of data we collect, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of relevant persons for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our products and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new commercial applications for such data as well as new products and features that make use of the data that we collect.\nWith the potential promulgation of new laws or regulations, we could be subject to claims, lawsuits and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nAlthough we are committed to making RedZone Map\u2122 as high in quality as we are capable while maintaining full compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be the subject of claims, lawsuits or other proceedings arising from our technologies, products or services, especially if any new laws or regulations are promulgated which may greatly increase the risk of litigation by users or third parties. Litigation could be costly and could divert us from focusing on our business operations. If any litigation occurs and results in an adverse outcome, it could negatively impact our public image and brand and have a detrimental effect on our expansion plans and operating results.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims related to our Zone products, which are costly to defend and could result in and/or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nA third party may sue us for infringing its intellectual property rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our efforts from our business activities. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to pay monetary damages, stop commercial activities related to our products or obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue marketing our products and services related to Zone and using our technologies. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. In addition, a court may require that we pay expenses or damages.\nIf Zone\u2019s security measures are breached, or if RedZone Map\u2122 is subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, users may curtail or stop using our products and services, or we may be subject to protracted litigation, which could harm our business.\nAny of our information security and processing systems, as well as third party data or network suppliers or our users, may experience damage or disruption of service from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, worms or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. We may also become the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. The security measures and procedures we, the third party suppliers and our users have in place to protect personal data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. Although we devote significant resources to our information security program and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these known or unknown threats.\nIf our security measures are breached, we may incur significant expenses in addressing and resolving the resulting problems. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be subject to protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from a data breach, cyber-attack or system failure could decrease the acceptance and use of Zone\u2019s products and services, which could harm Zone\u2019s prospective future growth.\nOur intended spin-off of Zone may result in substantial tax liabilities and additional costs to the Company.\nWe have recently announced our intention to spin-off Zone to become a separate public company. If we move forward with the spin off, and if the spin off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we sold the common stock of Zone in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Our stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them, taxed as a dividend (without reduction for any portion of our stockholder\u2019s basis in its shares of our common stock) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and possibly for purposes of state and local tax law, to the extent of a stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any arising from the taxable gain to us with respect to the desired spin off). The amount of any such taxes to our stockholders and to us may be substantial.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEGACY BUSINESS\nOur ongoing investment in new technology is inherently risky and could disrupt our business.\nTo remain competitive and grow we must continue to invest in new products and technologies and explore strategic investments. There is no assurance that these investment endeavors will be successful or that the products and technologies developed by these investments will be well received by the users. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, competitive pressures may force us to invest in developing or implementing new technologies at a substantial cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we fail to develop or implement new technologies in a cost-effective manner, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn our legacy business, we rely on a concentrated client base for much of our revenue.\nWe rely on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue in our legacy business. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our top four clients accounted for approximately 90.1% and 90.3%, respectively, of our consulting revenue. If we were to lose any of these clients, we cannot assure you that they could be replaced quickly or at all. Our loss of any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to rapid change.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, evolving distribution channels and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our services as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop IT solutions to meet client expectations, and offer services and solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in IT, evolving industry standards and changing client preferences. If we are unable to keep up with technological changes and changes in industry standards, our business, reputation and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive.\nThe market for IT consulting and data analytics services is intensely competitive, affected by rapid technological advances and includes a large number of competitors. Our competitors include the consulting divisions of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, major offshore outsourcing companies, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software development firms, management consulting firms, divisions of large computer hardware and software companies, and niche providers of IT services. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Competition imposes significant pricing pressures on us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business and financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel from our day-to-day operations. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market and the issuance of shares reserved for issuance to consultants and upon conversion of convertible instruments could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of April 11, 2018 we had 52,996,631 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and the closing sale price of our common stock on that date was $2.94. Pursuant to the resale registration statement on Form S-3 (file number 333-215313), declared effective by the SEC on January 13, 2017, we registered 3,926,293 shares of common stock for an institutional investor (the \u201cInvestor\u201d) in connection with the sale of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes on December 2, 2016 (the \u201cDecember 2016 Notes\u201d). On September 19, 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Exchange Agreement with the Investor, pursuant to which, among other things, the Investor exchanged $10,000 in aggregate principal outstanding under the December 2016 Notes into a convertible note issued by us in the amount of $697,000, which was subsequently converted in full into an aggregate of 232,334 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $3.00. In October 2017, we deregistered 1,999,862 shares of common stock from this registration statement after satisfying the December 2016 Notes in full by issuing 1,926,431 shares of common stock and paying in cash $126,557 in interest. As of April 11, 2018, the institutional investor has sold all 3,926,293 shares of our registered common stock under this registration statement that it received upon conversion of the December 2016 Notes, and all obligations under the December 2016 Notes have been satisfied.\nOn March 9, 2017 we filed a registration statement to register 3,332,075 shares of our common stock on Form S-3 (file number 333-216569) for the Investor in conjunction with the sale of Senior Secured Convertible Notes completed on February 8, 2017 (the \u201cFebruary 2017 Notes\u201d). The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 26, 2017 (the \u201cFebruary 2017 Notes Registration Statement\u201d). Pursuant to a letter agreement dated August 27, 2017, the Investor converted $2.5 million in then outstanding principal amount of the February 2017 Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest into an aggregate of 841,250 shares of our common stock (the \u201cFebruary Share Amount\u201d), and we provided Investor with the right to exchange shares of our common stock up to the February Share Amount for a senior secured convertible note (the \u201cExchange Right\u201d), which Exchange Right the Investor exercised in October 2017 by exchanging 100,000 shares of our common stock into a senior secured convertible note in the amount of $300,000 (the \u201cFebruary Exchange Note\u201d). In October 2017, we also entered into that certain Third Amendment and Exchange Agreement for the purpose of exchanging the February Exchange Note for 947,218 shares of our common stock issued to the Investor, along with the right to receive 552,782 additional shares of our common stock. Subsequently, in October 2017, we deregistered 1,479,189 shares of our common stock from the February 2017 Notes Registration Statement after satisfying the February 2017 Notes in full by issuing 1,852,886 shares of common stock to the Investor and paying in cash $125,190 in interest. The Investor has since sold all 1,479,189 shares that it received upon conversion of the February 2017 Notes, and all obligations under the February 2017 Notes have been satisfied.\nOn September 15, 2017, we filed a registration statement to register 9,084,133 shares of our common stock on Form S-3 (file number 333-220488) for the Investor in conjunction with the sale of Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the \u201cAugust 2017 Notes\u201d) and Warrants (the \u201cAugust Warrants\u201d) completed on August 16, 2017. We subsequently amended the registration statement, in response to comments from the SEC, to decrease the amount of shares registered thereunder to 3,043,030. The amended registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on December 4, 2017 (the \u201cAugust 2017 Notes Registration Statement\u201d). On November 21, 2017, we entered into that certain Fourth Amendment and Exchange Agreement with the Investor for the purpose of, among other things, (i) agreeing to reduce the number of shares of common stock required to be included in the registration statement covering the shares underlying the August 2017 Notes and August Warrants and (ii) exchanging the August Warrants for a new warrant, substantially in the form of the August Warrants, except as it relates to the exercise price and the expiration date (the \u201cExchanged Warrant\u201d). In addition, the Exchanged Warrant is subject to redemption, refund or alternate cashless exercise in certain enumerated circumstances. As of April 11, 2018, the Investor has sold all 3,043,030 shares of our registered common stock under the August 2017 Notes Registration Statement that it received upon conversion of the August 2017 Notes and exercise of the August Warrants, and all obligations under the August 2017 Notes have been satisfied. In addition, as of April 11, 2018, the entire Exchanged Warrant has been converted into 4,353,581 shares of our common stock.\nThe issuances of the December 2016 Notes, the February 2017 Notes, and the August 2017 Notes (collectively, the \u201cNotes\u201d) and the subsequent transactions, resulted in a high volume of activity for our securities. While no obligations are currently outstanding under the Notes, we may engage the Investor in similar transactions, which transactions may include registration rights. The registration of such additional securities and the potential for high volume trades of our common stock in connection with these financings may have a downward effect on our market price. In addition, in connection with the Notes, the Company has issued five-year warrants to a financial advisor, of which 810,401 are currently exercisable. Future issuance of our common stock upon exercise of these warrants may have a further negative impact on our stock price.\nFurther, as a result of the issuance of additional convertible notes on each of November 7, 2017 and January 23, 2018, 9,639,043 shares of our common stock may be issuable upon conversion of outstanding principal debt. We have repaid in cash all unrestricted principal in the amounts of $26,650,000 and $25,000,000 under the November 7, 2017 and the January 23, 2018 notes, respectively, as a result of which no unrestricted principal remains outstanding as of the date of this report. As such, the 9,639,043 shares noted above represent shares issuable upon conversion of restricted principal under such convertible debt for which an equivalent amount owed to us under the applicable notes has not yet been paid. Such restricted principal may not, as of the date of this report, be converted into any shares of our common stock. However, if holders of these notes provide additional payments to us under these notes, these shares will no longer constitute restricted principal and may be issuable by us to the holders.\nFinally, as of April 11, 2018, we have reserved for issuance, but not yet issued, (i) 5,136,355 shares of common stock reserved for various officers, directors, employees and consultants, (ii) 4,000,001 shares of common stock to MoviePass, upon receipt of stockholder approval, and (iii) 28,330,769 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of public warrants issued by us in registered public offerings with the SEC in December 2017 and February 2018. The issuance of shares the Company is obligated to issue, and the issuance of shares the Company may issue in connection with conversion or exercise of its outstanding convertible instruments, may result in a higher volume trading of the Company\u2019s securities, which may increase dilution of existing investors and further depress the market price of our common stock, which may negatively affect our stockholders\u2019 equity and our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us in the future.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nThe per share price of our common stock may vary from time to time. For example, the closing price of our common stock during 2017 was as low as $2.23 and as high as $32.90. Market prices for securities of technology companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf our ability to derive financial benefits from our ownership stake in MoviePass;\n\u25cf the ability of MoviePass to become cash flow positive or profitable;\n\u25cf the ability of MoviePass Ventures to enter into economic arrangements with film distributors and derive economic benefits from such arrangements;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the perception of investors and securities analysts regarding the risks to our business or the condition of our business;\n\u25cf changes in our relationships with key clients;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuation or earnings of our competitors or companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of technology companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to our business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management's attention.\nOur outstanding convertible notes contain provisions that may have a material adverse effect on our financial results\nThe holders of our convertible notes have certain additional rights upon an event of default under the notes which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail or cease or operations.\nUnder our senior convertible notes issued on November 7, 2017 and January 23, 2018, the holders have certain rights upon an event of default. Such rights include (i) an increase in the interest rate to 15% per year for one month and 18% per year thereafter; (ii) the alternate conversion price thereunder being adjusted to the lowest of (A) the applicable conversion price as in effect on the applicable date of conversion, and (B) the greater of (y) the default floor price (which ranges from $1.83 to $11.44, depending on receipt of applicable stockholder approvals and the terms of the applicable note), and (z) 75% of the lowest volume weighted average price of the common stock for each of the 30 consecutive trading days ending and including the trading day of delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable notice of conversion; and (iii) us being required to redeem all or a portion of the notes. At any time after certain notice requirements for an event of default are triggered, a holder of the notes may require us to redeem all or any portion of the notes by delivering written notice. Each portion of the notes subject to this redemption would be redeemed by us in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds or shares of our common stock, at the election of the holder, at a price equal to the greater of (I) 125% of the outstanding amount to be redeemed and (II) the product of (a) the outstanding amount to be redeemed divided by the conversion price multiplied by (b) the product of (1) 125% multiplied by (2) the highest closing sale price of the common stock on any trading day during the period commencing on the date preceding such event of default and ending on the date we make the entire payment required to be made under the notes. We may not have sufficient funds to settle the redemption price, or we may be required to issue shares that could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and drive down the market price of our securities.\nWhile we do not, as of the date of this report, have any unrestricted principle outstanding under these senior convertible notes, the holders may make prepayments under the unpaid portion of their corresponding investor notes, which would result in us incurring further repayment obligations under the convertible notes, which in turn could exacerbate the results of an event of default under the convertible notes, as described above. Any resulting exercise of any of these rights upon an event of default could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to curtail or cease operations.
