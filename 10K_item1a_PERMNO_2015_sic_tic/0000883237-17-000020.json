{"cik": "883237", "company": "VIRTUS INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThis section describes some of the potential risks relating to our business, such as market, liquidity, operational, reputation and regulatory. The risks described below are some of the more important factors that could affect our business. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating the Company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, revenues, profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe earn substantially all of our revenues based on assets under management, and any reduction in assets under management would reduce our revenues and profitability. Assets under management fluctuate based on many factors including market conditions, investment performance and client withdrawals.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated from asset-based fees from investment management products and services to individuals and institutions. Therefore, if the assets under management decline, our fee revenues would decline reducing profitability as some of our expenses are fixed. There are several reasons that assets under management could decline as discussed below:\n\u2022\nThe value of assets under management can decline due to price declines in specific securities, market segments or geographic areas where those assets are invested. Funds and portfolios that we manage related to certain geographic markets and industry sectors are particularly vulnerable to political, social and economic events in those markets and sectors. If these markets or industries decline or experience volatility, this could have a negative impact on our assets under management and our revenues. For example, certain non-U.S. markets, particularly emerging markets, are not as developed or as efficient as the U.S. financial markets and, as a result, may be less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. financial markets. Liquidity in such markets may be adversely impacted by factors including political or economic events, government policies, expropriation, volume trading limits by foreign investors and social or civil unrest. These factors may negatively impact the market value of an investment or our ability to dispose of it. In addition, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies could result in a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of assets under management that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies.\n\u2022\nThe performance of our investment strategies is critical and any real or perceived negative absolute or relative performance could negatively impact the maintenance and growth of assets under management. Net flows related to our investment strategies can be affected by investment performance relative to other competing investment strategies or to established benchmarks. Our investment management strategies are rated, ranked or assessed by independent third-parties, distribution partners, and industry periodicals and services. These assessments often influence the investment decisions of our clients. If the performance or assessment of our investment strategies is seen as underperforming relative to peers, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets by existing clients and the inability to attract additional investments from existing and new clients. In addition, certain of our investment strategies have capacity constraints, as there is a limit to the number of securities available for the strategy to operate effectively. In those instances, we may choose to limit access to new or existing investors. In addition, certain mutual funds employ the use of leverage as part of their investment strategies, which will increase or decrease the Company\u2019s assets under management, and the risk associated with the investment, as the proceeds from the use of leverage are invested in accordance with the funds\u2019 investment strategies.\n\u2022\nGeneral domestic and global economic and political conditions can influence assets under management. Changes in interest rates, the availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations) and other conditions may impact the equity and credit markets which may influence our assets under management. Capital and credit markets can experience substantial volatility. Employment rates, continued economic weakness and budgetary challenges in the EuroZone, regional turmoil in the Middle East, concern over growth prospects in China and emerging markets, growing debt loads for certain countries and uncertainty about the consequences of governments eventually withdrawing monetary stimulus all indicate that economic and political conditions remain unpredictable. If the security markets decline or experience volatility, our assets under management and our revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, diminishing investor confidence in the markets and/or adverse market conditions could result in a decrease in investor risk tolerance. Such a decrease could prompt investors to reduce their rate of investment or to fully withdraw from\nmarkets, which could lower our overall assets under management and have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and growth prospects.\nThe volatility in the markets in the recent past has highlighted the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrated how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially adversely impact the performance of other institutions. Our assets under management have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk due to the default by a counterparty or client or in the event of a market failure or disruption or otherwise. In the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties, we may suffer significant declines in assets under management and severe liquidity or valuation issues.\nMoreover, a significant amount of our assets under management are in investments represented by strategies that primarily invest in securities in non-U.S. companies. Many non-U.S. financial markets are not as developed or as efficient as the U.S. financial markets and, as a result, have limited liquidity and greater price volatility and may lack established regulations. Liquidity in such markets also may be adversely impacted by political or economic events, government policies, expropriation, volume trading limits by foreign investors and social and civil unrest. An investment\u2019s market value or the ability to dispose of an investment may be adversely impacted by any of these factors. Governments of foreign jurisdictions may assert their abilities to tax local gains and/or income of foreign investors, including our clients, which could adversely impact the economics associated with investing in foreign jurisdictions or non-U.S. based companies. These risks also could impact the performance of our strategies that invest in such markets and, in particular, strategies that concentrate investments in emerging market companies and countries.\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates can have adverse effects on our assets under management. Increases in interest rates from their historically low present levels may adversely affect the net asset values of our assets under management. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could lead to outflows in fixed income assets that we manage as investors seek higher yields. Any of these effects could lower our assets under management and revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, would lead to a reduction in our net income.\nAny of these factors could cause our assets under management to decline and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment advisory agreements are subject to withdrawal, renegotiation or termination on short notice.\nOur clients include the boards of directors for our sponsored mutual funds, managed account program sponsors, private clients and institutional clients. Our investment management agreements with these clients may be terminated upon short notice without penalty. As a result, there would be little impediment to these sponsors or clients terminating our agreements. Our clients may terminate or renegotiate their investment contracts with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with us due to a number of reasons including investment performance, reputational, regulatory or compliance issues, loss of key investment management or other personnel or a change in management or control of clients, third-party distributors, subadvisers or others with whom we have relationships. The directors of our sponsored funds may deem it to be in the best interests of a fund\u2019s shareholders to make decisions adverse to us, such as reducing the compensation paid to us, requesting that we subsidize fund expenses over certain thresholds, or imposing restrictions on our management of the fund. Under the Investment Company Act, investment advisory agreements automatically terminate in the event of an assignment, which may occur if, among other events, the Company undergoes a change in control, such as any person acquiring 25% voting rights of our common stock. If an assignment were to occur, we cannot be certain that the fund\u2019s board of directors and its stockholders would approve a new investment advisory agreement. In addition, investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client. If an assignment occurs, we cannot be certain that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary fund approvals or the necessary consents from our clients. The withdrawal, renegotiation or termination of any investment management contract relating to a material portion of assets under management would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a reduction in our revenues and profitability.\nMaintaining a strong reputation with the investment community and other constituencies is critical to our success. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate even if they are without merit or satisfactorily addressed. Our reputation may be impacted by many factors, including but not limited to: poor performance; litigation; conflicts of interests; regulatory inquiries, investigations or findings; operational failures (including cyber breaches); intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products or services; material weaknesses in our internal controls; or employee misconduct or rumors. Any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and\nretain clients and key personnel, adversely impact relationships with third-party distributors and other business partners and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage client assets under agreements that have established investment guidelines or other contractual requirements, and any failure to comply could result in claims, losses or regulatory sanctions, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nThe agreements under which we manage client assets often have established investment guidelines or other contractual requirements that we are required to comply with in providing our investment management services. Although we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent, detect, and correct such errors, any failure or allegation of a failure to comply with these guidelines or other requirement could result in client claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to financial covenants under our existing credit facility, and failure to satisfy those covenants could\nresult in any outstanding indebtedness becoming immediately due.\nUnder the Company\u2019s senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), the Company must maintain certain financial covenants. A summary of the Credit Facility terms and financial covenants is included in this report under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We cannot assure you that at all times in the future we will satisfy all such financial covenants or obtain any required waiver or amendment, in which event all outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due. This could result in a substantial reduction in the liquidity of the Company and could challenge our ability to meet future cash needs of the business.\nOur business relies on the ability to attract and retain key employees, and the loss of such employees could negatively affect financial performance.\nThe success of our business is dependent to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain key employees such as senior executives, portfolio managers, securities analysts and sales personnel. Competition in the job market for these professionals is generally intense and compensation levels in the industry are highly competitive. The market for investment managers is also characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain key employees, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees increase, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we utilize Company equity awards as part of our compensation plans and as a means for recruiting and retaining key employees. Declines in our stock price could result in deterioration in the value of equity awards granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of retaining key employees through stock-based awards.\nIn certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain assets under management, or the loss of certain client accounts. Any inability to retain our key employees, attract qualified employees, or replace key employee positions in a timely manner, could lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, there could be additional costs to replace, retain or attract new talent which would result in a decrease in our profitability and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe highly competitive nature of the asset management industry may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, increase amounts paid or support for financial intermediaries, all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.\nWe face significant competition from a wide variety of financial institutions, including other investment management companies, as well as from proprietary products offered by our distribution partners such as banks, broker-dealers and financial planning firms. Competition in our businesses is based on several factors including investment performance, access to distribution channels, service to financial advisers and their clients and fees charged. Our competitors, many of which are larger than we are, often offer similar products, use similar distribution sources, offer less expensive products, have greater access to key distribution channels and have greater resources, geographic footprints and name recognition than we do. Additionally, certain products and asset classes, such as passive or index-based products, are becoming increasingly popular with investors. Existing clients may withdraw their assets in order to invest in these products, and we may be unable to attract additional investments from existing and new clients, which would lead to a decline in our assets under management and market share.\nIn addition, our profits are highly dependent on the fee levels for our products and services. In recent years, there has been a trend in certain segments of our markets toward lower fees and lower fee products, such as passive products. Competition could cause us to reduce the fees that we charge for products and services. In order to maintain appropriate fee levels in a\ncompetitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment products and services that are viewed as appropriate in relation to the fees charged. If our clients, including our fund boards, were to view our fees as being high relative to the market or the returns provided by our investment products, we may choose to reduce our fee levels or we may experience significant redemptions in our assets under management which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to an extensive and complex regulatory environment, and changes in regulations or failure to comply with regulation could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe investment management industry in which we operate is subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation. We are regulated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, and we are subject to regulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission under the Commodities Exchange Act. Our Global Funds are subject to regulation by the CBI. We are also regulated by FINRA, the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), as well as other federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe regulatory environment that we operate in changes often and has seen increased regulatory focus in recent years. For example, in fiscal 2015, the SEC proposed new rules addressing liquidity risk management by registered open-end funds and the use of derivatives by registered open-end and closed-end funds. If these regulations are adopted substantially as proposed, they could materially impact the provision of investment services or limit opportunities for certain funds we manage and increase our management and administration costs, with potential adverse effects on our revenues, expenses and results of operations.\nAlthough we spend extensive time and resources on compliance efforts designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, if we or our affiliates fail to timely and properly modify and update our compliance procedures in this changing and highly complex regulatory environment, we may be subject to various legal proceedings, including civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement actions and result in fines, penalties or suspensions of individual employees or limitations on particular business activities which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or implement changes in tax policy, which may result in the assessment of additional taxes. We regularly assess the appropriateness of our tax positions and reporting. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable. In addition, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes available to us will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income.\nWe utilize unaffiliated firms in providing investment management services and any matters that have an adverse impact to their business, or any change in our relationships with these unaffiliated firms could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which will adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe utilize unaffiliated subadvisers as investment managers for certain of our retail products and we have licensing arrangements with unaffiliated data providers. Because we typically have no ownership interests in these unaffiliated firms, we do not control the business activities of such firms. Problems stemming from the business activities of these unaffiliated firms may negatively impact or disrupt such firms\u2019 operations or expose them to disciplinary action or reputational harm. Furthermore, any such matters at these unaffiliated firms may have an adverse impact on our business or reputation or expose us to regulatory scrutiny, including with respect to our oversight of such firms.\nWe periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and we cannot provide assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or the unaffiliated firms. These relationships can also be terminated upon short notice without penalty. In addition, similar to our business, the departure of key employees at our unaffiliated subadvisers could cause higher redemption rates for certain assets under management, or the loss of certain client accounts. An interruption or termination of our unaffiliated firm relationships could affect our ability to market our products and result in a reduction in assets under management which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe distribute through intermediaries, and changes in key distribution relationships could reduce our revenues, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur primary source of distribution for our retail products is through intermediaries that include third-party financial intermediaries, such as: major wire houses; national, regional and independent broker-dealers and financial advisors; banks and financial planners and registered investment advisors. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution systems. These distributors are generally not contractually required to distribute our products and typically offer their clients\nvarious investment products and services, including proprietary products and services, in addition to and in competition with our products and services. While we compensate these intermediaries for selling our products and services pursuant to contractual agreements, we may not be able to retain access to these channels at all or at similar pricing. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and profitability. To the extent that existing or future intermediaries prefer to do business with our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and profitability could decline.\nWe and our third-party service providers rely on numerous technology systems, and a temporary business interruption, security breach or technology systems failures could negatively impact our business and profitability.\nOur technology systems and those of our third-party service providers are critical to our operations. The ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information, process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is an essential part of our business. Any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing such transactions or such reports, other breaches and errors, and any inadequacies in other customer service, could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities, or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us. Our customer service capability, as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports, is highly dependent on our third-party service providers\u2019 information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, whether resulting from technology or infrastructure breakdowns, defects or external causes such as fire, natural disaster, viruses, acts of terrorism or power disruptions, could result in financial loss, negatively impact our reputation, and negatively affect our ability to do business. Although we, and our third-party service providers, have disaster recovery plans in place, we may experience temporary interruptions if a natural disaster or prolonged power outages were to occur which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, like other companies in the financial services industry, our computer systems are regularly subject to and are expected to continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. Over time, however, the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and any controls we put in place and preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. Breach of our technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business through cyber-attacks, or failure to manage and secure our technology environment, could result in interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of our business, loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by a breach, additional costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from an incident.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information as well as non-public business information. Although we and our third-party vendors take precautions, we may still be vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use. A breach of the systems or hardware could result in an unauthorized access to our proprietary business or client data or release of this type of data, which could subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws which may result in fines or penalties, the termination of existing client contracts, costly mitigation activities and harm to our reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOwnership of a relatively large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and dramatically affect our share price.\nA large percentage of our common stock is held by a limited number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders decide to liquidate their positions, it could cause significant fluctuation in the share price of our common stock. Public companies with a relatively concentrated level of institutional shareholders, such as we have, often have difficulty generating trading volume in their stock which may increase the volatility in the price of our common stock.\nCivil litigation and government investigations or proceedings could adversely affect our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and there have been substantial incidences of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. From time to time, we and/or our funds may be named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits or be involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits seeking substantial damages. We and/or our funds are also involved from time to time in governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings. For example, in fiscal 2015, two putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers and affiliates, alleging violation of certain provisions of federal securities laws. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further description of these class action complaints.\nAny of these lawsuits, investigations or proceedings could result in reputational damage, loss of clients and assets, settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties, increased costs and expenses in resolving a claim, diversion of employee resources and resulting financial losses. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants or by a large number of claimants, when claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular period, depending on our results for that period, or could cause us significant reputational harm, which could harm our business prospects.\nWe depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain clients. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants, including investors in our funds, or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the asset management industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses. We may incur substantial legal expenses in defending against proceedings commenced by a client, regulatory authority or other private litigant. Substantial legal liability levied on us could cause significant reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant portion of our assets invested in marketable securities which exposes us to earnings volatility, as the value of these investments fluctuate, as well as risk of capital loss.\nWe use capital to seed new investment strategies and make new investments to introduce new products or enhance distribution access. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $183.5 million of seed capital investments in a variety of asset classes including alternative, fixed income and equity strategies. We also had $25.7 million invested in our consolidated investment product (\"CIP\"). Many of these investments employ a long-term investment strategy and entail an optimal investment period spanning several years. Accordingly, during this investment period, the Company\u2019s capital utilized in these investments may not be available for other corporate purposes at all or without significantly diminishing our investment return. We cannot provide assurance that these investments will perform as expected. Moreover, increases or decreases in the value of these investments will increase the volatility of our earnings, and a decline in the value of these investments would result in the loss of capital and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intended quarterly distributions may not be paid as intended or at all.\nThe declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividend, may change at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividend, we consider general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions (including under the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock that we issued on February 1, 2016) and obligations, legal, tax, regulatory and other restrictions that may have implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as we may deem relevant. Our ability to pay common stock dividends in excess of our current quarterly dividend will be subject to restrictions under the terms of the indebtedness contemplated by the debt commitment letter. We cannot assure you that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, will be paid.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to meet the future cash needs of the Company is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although the Company has been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, it may not be in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we maintained $64.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $183.5 million in seed capital investments with $30.0 million in debt outstanding excluding the debt of our consolidated investment product for which recourse to the Company is limited to our $25.7 million investment. See Footnote 18 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt of the consolidated investment product. Additionally on February 1, 2017, we issued 910,000 shares of common stock and 1,150,000 shares of 7.25% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in a public offering for net proceeds of $207.1 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. Our ability to access capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. We may need to raise capital to fund new business initiatives in the future, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur common stock ranks junior to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation and ranks junior to our indebtedness which may limit any payment or other distribution of assets to our common stock in the event we are liquidated\nOur common stock ranks junior to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless accumulated dividends\nhave been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for all completed dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock a liquidation preference equal to $100.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared).\nAdditionally, in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock would rank below all debt claims against us. As a result, holders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up until after all of our obligations to our debt holders have been satisfied.\nWe have corporate governance provisions that may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks.\nWe regularly review, and from time to time have discussions with and engage in, potential strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be material. On December 16, 2016, for example, we entered into an agreement (the \u201cRidgeWorth Acquisition\u201d) to acquire RidgeWorth Holdings, LLC (\u201cRidgeWorth\u201d). We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in negotiating the required agreements or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements including the RidgeWorth Acquisition or any other future strategic transactions.\nAny strategic transactions may also involve a number of other risks, including additional demands on our staff, unanticipated problems regarding integration of operating facilities, technologies and new employees and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to, or otherwise unknown by, us prior to closing a transaction. In addition, any business we acquire may underperform relative to expectations or may lose customers or employees. As a result, the Company may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits from such transactions or may be required to spend additional time or money on integration. Additional risks related to the RidgeWorth Acquisition are further described below.\nRisks Relating to the RidgeWorth Acquisition\nThe RidgeWorth Acquisition is subject to closing conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and it may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the RidgeWorth Acquisition could have material and adverse effects on the Company.\nOn December 16, 2016, the Company entered into a merger agreement in connection with the RidgeWorth Acquisition. The completion of the RidgeWorth Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the receipt of a specified level of required consents from RidgeWorth clients, which make both the completion and the timing of completion of the RidgeWorth Acquisition uncertain. Also, either RidgeWorth or the Company may terminate the merger agreement if the RidgeWorth Acquisition has not been completed by the July 16, 2017 termination date (subject to extension to September 16, 2017 under certain circumstances), unless the failure of the RidgeWorth Acquisition to be completed has resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform its obligations. If the RidgeWorth Acquisition is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the Company\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected. Additionally, in the event the RidgeWorth Acquisition is not completed, the Company will be subject to a number of risks without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the RidgeWorth Acquisition, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company will be required to pay its costs relating to the RidgeWorth Acquisition, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, whether or not the RidgeWorth Acquisition is completed;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by the Company\u2019s management to matters relating to the RidgeWorth Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the RidgeWorth Acquisition will be completed, or to the extent that the RidgeWorth Acquisition is fundamental to the Company\u2019s business strategy.\nUncertainty regarding the completion of the RidgeWorth Acquisition may cause their clients to withdraw assets under management or to decline to place additional assets under management, may cause their potential clients to delay or defer decisions concerning RidgeWorth and may adversely affect RidgeWorth\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees.\nThe RidgeWorth Acquisition will happen only if stated conditions are met, including, among others, the receipt of a baseline level of required consents from RidgeWorth clients. Many of the conditions are beyond the control of the Company. In addition, both RidgeWorth and the Company have rights to terminate the merger agreement under various circumstances. As a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the RidgeWorth Acquisition. This uncertainty, along with potential RidgeWorth client uncertainty regarding how the acquisition could affect the services offered by RidgeWorth, may cause their clients to withdraw assets under management or to decline to place additional assets under management, and may cause potential RidgeWorth clients to delay or defer decisions concerning entering into a relationship with RidgeWorth, which could negatively impact revenues and earnings of RidgeWorth. Similarly, uncertainty regarding the completion of the RidgeWorth Acquisition may foster uncertainty among their employees about their future roles. This may adversely affect the ability of RidgeWorth to attract and retain key management, portfolio management, sales, marketing, and trading personnel, which could have an adverse effect on their ability to generate revenues at anticipated levels prior or subsequent to the consummation of the RidgeWorth Acquisition.\nUnder the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the \u201c1940 Act\u201d, the investment advisory agreement between RidgeWorth mutual funds, an open-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act, and RidgeWorth will terminate automatically in the event RidgeWorth undergoes a change of control as recognized under the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, which the RidgeWorth Acquisition will constitute such a change of control. In connection with the RidgeWorth Acquisition, shareholders of RidgeWorth mutual funds will be requested to approve a reorganization of each series of RidgeWorth mutual funds into a corresponding series of Virtus Asset Trust. If shareholders of a RidgeWorth mutual fund do not approve the reorganization and the parties to the RidgeWorth Acquisition proceed to close on the RidgeWorth Acquisition, then the investment advisory agreement between such RidgeWorth mutual fund and RidgeWorth will terminate automatically and an interim advisory agreement with RidgeWorth will go into effect to permit additional time to solicit shareholder approval. In such an event, each RidgeWorth mutual fund\u2019s board of trustees may take further action as it deems to be in the best interests of such RidgeWorth mutual fund. In addition, as required by the Advisers Act, each of the investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts and private funds that RidgeWorth manages may not be assigned, as defined in the Advisers Act, without the consent of the client. The withdrawal, renegotiation or termination of any investment advisory agreement relating to a material portion of assets under management would have an adverse impact on RidgeWorth\u2019s results of operations and financial condition as well as any anticipated benefits from the RidgeWorth Acquisition.\nWe may not realize the benefits we expect from the RidgeWorth Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of the RidgeWorth Acquisition will depend in large part on the success of integrating the personnel, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of the two companies\u2019 businesses following the completion of the acquisition. The Company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the RidgeWorth Acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the Company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of RidgeWorth or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the RidgeWorth Acquisition could impair the operations of the Company. In addition, the Company anticipates that the overall integration of RidgeWorth will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business. Potential difficulties the combined business may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe integration of personnel, operations, strategies, technologies and support services;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective personnel from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe retention of the existing clients and the retention or transition of RidgeWorth vendors;\n\u2022\nthe retention of key intermediary distribution relationships;\n\u2022\nthe integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022\nthe retention of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of the costs associated with the combined company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nthe consolidation and rationalization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the RidgeWorth Acquisition.\nThe anticipated benefits and synergies include the elimination of duplicative personnel, realization of efficiencies in consolidating duplicative corporate, business support functions and amortization of purchased intangibles for tax purposes. However, these anticipated benefits and synergies assume a successful integration and are based on projections, which are inherently uncertain, and other assumptions. Even if integration is successful, anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness to fund the RidgeWorth Acquisition may impact our financial position and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nIn connection with the RidgeWorth Acquisition, we expect to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness, which may result in substantially higher borrowing costs and a shorter maturity date than those from other anticipated financing alternatives. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. The combined company may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness contemplated by the debt commitment letter will subject us to additional financial and operating covenants, which may limit our flexibility in responding to our business needs. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, related to the new debt facility or otherwise, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default could allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.\nOur overall leverage and terms of our financing could, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness, including the new debt facility;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward.\nSPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
