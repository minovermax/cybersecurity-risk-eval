RISK FACTORS\nOur business and financial condition can be impacted by a number of factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of these risks could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated results and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected if one of the Company\u2019s significant clients terminates its engagement of the Company or if there is a downturn in one of the industries the Company serves.\nThe Company\u2019s ten largest clients generated approximately 74%, 74% and 77% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company\u2019s largest client for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was American Express, which generated approximately 21%, 22% and 25% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company\u2019s second largest client for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was State Street Bank, which generated approximately 15%, 14% and 16% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company\u2019s third largest client for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was Federal Express Corporation, which generated approximately 12%, 12% and 8% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company expects to continue to derive a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues from American Express, State Street Bank and Federal Express Corporation. Failure to meet a client\u2019s expectations could result in cancellation or non-renewal of the Company\u2019s engagement and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect its ability to attract new business. Many of the Company\u2019s contracts, including all of the Company\u2019s contracts with its ten largest clients, are terminable by the client with limited notice to the Company and without compensation beyond payment for the professional services rendered through the date of termination. An unanticipated termination of a significant engagement could result in the loss of substantial anticipated revenues. The loss of any significant client or engagement could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company also derived, and expects to continue to derive, a significant portion of its revenues from clients in certain industries, including the financial services, insurance and healthcare industries. Clients in the financial services industry generated approximately 49%, 50% and 51% of the Company\u2019s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. A downturn in the financial services industry or other industries from which the Company derives significant revenues could result in less revenue from current and potential clients in such industry and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s KPO services to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliate are provided through a joint venture between\nSyntel and an affiliate of State Street Bank and Trust Company. Sales of KPO services only to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliate represented approximately 12%, 13% and 14% of the Company\u2019s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The current master agreement under which the Company is able to provide KPO services to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliate appoints the Company as an authorized provider but does not require that the clients use the Company for KPO services. KPO services are ordered through separate work orders as may be agreed to by the clients and the Company from time to time. The master agreement is terminable on short notice, has no minimum volume commitments, and has an initial expiration date of September 30, 2020, with the ability of State Street Bank and Trust Company to further extend the agreement for an additional one-year term by providing at least 6 months prior written notice to the Company. State Street Bank and Trust Company, through a separate shareholders agreement between an affiliate and an affiliate of Syntel, has the right to purchase the Company\u2019s interest in the joint venture at an agreed upon formula price. This purchase right is exercisable by State Street Bank and Trust Company affiliate (i) during the 30-day period beginning on the first business day of the 90-day period prior to the expiration of the initial term of the master agreement (September 30, 2020) or the expiration of the renewal term (September 30, 2021), (ii) in the event that State Street Bank and Trust Company or its affiliate terminates the master agreement due to the Company\u2019s change in control, insolvency, inadequate financial resources or material breach of the master agreement or the shareholders agreement, (iii) if State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliates suffer certain cumulative losses under the master agreement that exceed $25 million, or (iv) if the master agreement is required by law or regulation to be terminated. The exercise of this purchase right would have the effect of terminating the Company\u2019s ability to provide KPO services to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliate and transferring some related KPO professionals and assets to State Street Bank and Trust Company. State Street Bank and Trust Company\u2019s exercise of the purchase right under the shareholders agreement could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected if there were a default in providing contracted services and that default resulted in damages that were substantially in excess of current insurance coverage or there were a denial of an insurance claim by the Company\u2019s insurance carriers.\nThe Company provides information technology and KPO services that are integral to our clients\u2019 businesses. If the Company were to default in the provision of contractually agreed-upon services, Company clients could suffer significant damages and make claims upon the Company for those damages. Although the Company believes it has adequate processes in place to protect against defaults in the provisions of services, errors may occur, particularly in KPO services which are more transactional in nature. The Company currently carries $25 million in errors and omissions liability coverage for all services provided by the Company other than the joint venture between an affiliate of Syntel and an affiliate of State Street Bank and Trust company. That joint venture currently carries $40 million in errors and omissions coverage. To the extent client damages were deemed recoverable against the Company and were substantially in\nexcess of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, or if the Company\u2019s claims for insurance coverage were denied by the Company\u2019s insurance carriers for any reason including, but not limited to a Company client\u2019s failure to provide insurance carrier-required documentation or a Company client\u2019s failure to follow insurance carrier-required claim settlement procedures, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued uncertainty and negative conditions in the worldwide economic markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWorldwide financial systems and economic conditions continue to be under stress. In response to that stress, the Company\u2019s customers may curtail their spending programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s services. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers. Likewise, suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business of delivering professional services is labor intensive, and accordingly, the Company\u2019s success depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to attract, develop, motivate, retain and effectively utilize highly-skilled professionals. The Company believes that there is a continuing shortage of, and significant competition for, professionals who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver the Company\u2019s services, both in the United States and in India, and that such professionals are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. The Company believes that as a result of these factors, the Company operates within an industry that experiences a significant rate of annual turnover of personnel. The Company\u2019s business plans are based on hiring and training a significant number of additional professionals each year to meet anticipated turnover and increased staffing needs. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and to obtain new business depends, in large part, on the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified professionals. The Company performs a portion of the Company\u2019s employee recruitment for U.S. positions in foreign countries, particularly India. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, annual voluntary attrition was 22.3%, 17.0% and 14.4%, respectively. For the same periods, the number of net hires was (16), 901 and 2,245 respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified professionals or that the Company will be successful in retaining current or future employees. Increased hiring by technology companies, particularly in India, and increasing worldwide competition for skilled technology professionals may lead to a shortage in the availability of qualified personnel in the markets in which the Company operates and hires. Failure to hire and train or retain qualified professionals in sufficient numbers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment regulation of immigration and work permits/visas could impact the Company\u2019s ability to effectively utilize the Company\u2019s Global Delivery Model.\nThe Company recruits professionals on a global basis and, therefore, must comply with the immigration and work permit/visa laws and regulations of the countries in which the Company operates or plans to operate. As of December 31, 2015, 3,399 IT professionals representing approximately 13.9% of the Company\u2019s worldwide workforce provided services under work permits/visas. The Company\u2019s inability to obtain sufficient work permits/visas due to the impact of these regulations, including any changes to immigration and work permit/visa regulations in particular jurisdictions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment taxation in the countries where the Company does business could reduce the Company\u2019s overall profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s Indian subsidiaries have units registered as a Software Technology park (STP), an Export Oriented Unit (EOU), or a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) unit. Units registered as a STP, EOU and certain units located in a SEZ were exempt from payment of corporate income taxes on the profits generated by these units either for ten years of operations or until March 31, 2011, whichever came first. Other units located in a SEZ are eligible for 100% exemption from payment of corporate income taxes for the first five years of operation and 50% exemption for the next two years and a further 50% exemption for another three years, subject to fulfillment of criteria laid down. New units in a SEZ that are operational after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a 100% exemption from payment of corporate income taxes for the first five years of operation, 50% exemption for the next five years and a further 50% exemption for another five years, subject to the fulfillment of certain criteria. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2011 from our existing STP units are fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (34.608% as of December 31, 2015).\nThe Company expects to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Development centers operating in SEZs will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods of up to 15 years. The Indian government has proposed certain interpretive positions regarding the tax incentives applicable to SEZs. The Indian government has discussed making further changes in the SEZ policies which could be adverse to our operations. Certain of our development centers currently operate in SEZs and many of our future planned development centers are likely to operate in SEZs. A change in the Indian government\u2019s policies affecting SEZs in a manner that adversely impacts the incentives for establishing and operating facilities in SEZs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has relied on the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the Income-tax Rules, 1962 and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, which are subject to change or modification by subsequent legislation, regulatory changes, administrative pronouncements, or judicial decisions. Any such change, which could be prospective, retrospective or retroactive, could affect the validity of the conclusions herein.\nThe United States government is discussing, and other countries\u2019 governments may discuss, increased corporate taxation including the possibility of taxing profits generated by the Company outside the country of taxation. Increased corporate taxation could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has disputed and potentially disputable tax liabilities of $132.26 million and $112.59 million, respectively, relating to various fiscal years. Against the above, the Company has recognized tax liabilities, representing the unrecognized tax benefits, of $50.24 million and $40.49 million and corresponding interest of $1.33 million and $1.32 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company periodically reviews the disputed and potentially disputable tax liabilities, which includes reviews by the external tax consultants and tax counsels. These reviews are performed to ensure the adequacy of the corresponding provision for tax liabilities and that appropriate provisions are being made.\nThe Company has paid income taxes of $42.18 million and $35.86 million against the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $50.24 million and $40.49 million, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company has paid the taxes in order to reduce the possible interest and penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe IT and KPO services industries are intensely competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe IT and KPO services industries are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. The Company competes with a variety of other companies, depending on the services offered. In IT services, the Company primarily competes with domestic firms such as Accenture, Cognizant, EDS and IBM Global Services and with an increasing number of India-based companies including Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro Technologies. The Company is also seeing increased competition from non-Indian sources such as Eastern Europe and the Philippines. In KPO services, the Company primarily competes with other offshore KPO vendors including HCL Technologies, Wipro Technologies and WNS. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the Company does. As a result, they may be able to compete more aggressively on pricing, respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements, or devote greater resources to the development and promotion of IT services and KPO services than the Company does. India-based companies also present significant price competition due to their competitive cost structures and tax advantages. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into the Company\u2019s markets and the Company has faced, and expects to continue to face, additional competition from new IT service and KPO service providers. Further, there is a risk that the Company\u2019s clients may elect to increase their internal resources to satisfy their services needs as opposed to relying on a third-party vendor. The IT services industry is also undergoing consolidation, which may result in increased competition in the Company\u2019s target markets. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or that competitive pressures will not materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results are variable.\nThe Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including: the timing, number and scope of customer engagements commenced and completed during the quarter; progress on fixed-price engagements; timing and cost associated with expansion of the Company\u2019s facilities; changes in professional wage rates; the accuracy of estimates of resources and time frames required to complete pending assignments; the number of working days in a quarter; employee hiring, attrition and utilization rates; the mix of services performed on-site, off-site and offshore; termination of engagements; start-up expenses for new engagements; length of sales cycles; customers\u2019 budget cycles; and investment time for training. Because a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses are relatively fixed, variations in revenues may cause significant variations in operating results. It is possible that the Company\u2019s operating results could be below or above the expectations of market analysts and investors. In such an event, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected. No assurance can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate, causing an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition at the time.\nThe Company\u2019s international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties.\nRevenues from customers outside North America represented approximately 9.9% of the Company\u2019s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company anticipates that revenues from customers outside North America will continue to account for a material portion of the Company\u2019s revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as the Company expands its international presence, particularly in Europe. Risks associated with international operations include the burden in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable. In addition, we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations. We may also face difficulties integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture. Our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTerrorist activity, war or natural disasters could make travel and communication more difficult and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nTerrorist activity, war or natural disasters could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Terrorist activities, other acts of violence or war, or natural disasters occur in India, the United States and in other countries around the world and have the potential to have a direct impact on the Company\u2019s clients.\nSuch events may disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to communicate between the Company\u2019s various Global Development Centers and between the Company\u2019s Global Development Centers and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 sites, make travel more difficult, make it more difficult to obtain work visas for many of the Company\u2019s technology professionals and effectively curtail the Company\u2019s ability to deliver the Company\u2019s services to the Company\u2019s clients. Such obstacles to business may increase the Company\u2019s expenses and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s clients visit several technology services firms prior to reaching a decision on vendor selection. Terrorist activity, war or natural disasters could make travel more difficult and delay, postpone or cancel decisions to use the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company\u2019s fixed-price engagements may commit the Company to unfavorable terms.\nThe Company undertakes development and maintenance engagements, which are billed on a fixed-price basis, in addition to the engagements billed on a time-and-materials basis. Fixed-price revenues from development and maintenance activity represented approximately 42%, 40% and 38% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Any failure to estimate the resources and time required to complete a fixed-price engagement on time and to the required quality levels or any unexpected increase in the cost to the Company of IT professionals, office space or materials could expose the Company to risks associated with cost overruns and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture legislation in countries where the Company does business could significantly impact the ability of the Company\u2019s clients to utilize the Company\u2019s services.\nThe issue of companies outsourcing services abroad has become a topic of political discussion in the United States and other countries. Measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing have been enacted in some jurisdictions, and there is currently legislation restricting outsourcing pending or being discussed in several other jurisdictions where the Company does business. The measures that have been enacted to date have not significantly adversely affected the Company\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that pending or future legislation that would significantly adversely affect the Company\u2019s business will not be enacted. If enacted, such measures are likely to fall within two categories: (1) a broadening of restrictions on outsourcing by government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly, and/or (2) measures that impact private industry, such as tax disincentives, restrictions on the transfer or maintenance of certain information abroad and/or intellectual property transfer restrictions. In the event that any such measures are enacted, or if the prospect of such measures being enacted increases, the ability of the Company\u2019s clients to utilize its services could be restricted or become less economical and the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWage pressures in India and other countries where the Company does business may reduce the Company\u2019s profit margins.\nWage pressures in India and other countries where the Company does business may prevent the Company from sustaining the Company\u2019s competitive advantage and may reduce the Company\u2019s profit margins. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of the Company\u2019s billable workforce was in India. Wage costs in India have historically been lower than wage costs in the United States and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, which has been one of the Company\u2019s competitive strengths. However, wage increases in India may prevent the Company from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect the Company\u2019s profit margins. Wages in India are increasing at a faster rate than in the United States, which could result in increased costs for technology professionals. Compensation increases may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on its ability to market new services to the Company\u2019s existing and new clients.\nThe Company has been expanding the nature and scope of its engagements by extending the breadth of services the Company offers. The success of the Company\u2019s service offerings depends, in part, upon continued demand for such services by the Company\u2019s existing and new clients and the Company\u2019s ability to meet this demand in a cost competitive and effective manner. The Company\u2019s new service offerings may not effectively meet client needs, and the Company may be unable to attract existing and new clients to these service offerings. The increased breadth of the Company\u2019s service offerings may also result in larger and more complex client projects. This will require that the Company establish closer relationships with its clients, and potentially with other technology service providers and vendors, and develop a more thorough understanding of the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 operations. The Company\u2019s ability to establish these relationships will depend on a number of factors including the proficiency of the Company\u2019s technology professionals and its management personnel and the willingness of the Company\u2019s existing and potential clients to provide it with information about their businesses. If the Company is not able to successfully market and provide the Company\u2019s new and broader service offerings, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company may be affected by political and regulatory conditions in countries where the Company does business.\nChanges in the political or regulatory climate in countries where the Company does business, including the following, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. No assurance can be given that the Company will not be adversely affected by changes in inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls, interest rates, tax provisions, social stability or other political, economic or diplomatic developments. Some governments have provided tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in certain sectors of the economy, including the technology industry. Certain of these benefits directly benefited the Company including, among others, tax holidays, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment. There can be no assurance that these benefits will be continued or that other similar benefits will be provided in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s margins may be adversely affected if demand for the Company\u2019s services slows.\nIf demand for the Company\u2019s services slows, the Company\u2019s utilization and billing rates for its technology professionals could be adversely affected, which may result in lower gross and operating profits.\nThe Company is subject to risks of fluctuation in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee.\nThe Company holds a significant amount of its cash in U.S. dollars and in Indian rupees. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues, other income, cost of services, gross margin and net income, which may in turn have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. The Company expects that a majority of the Company\u2019s revenues will continue to be generated in U.S. dollars for the foreseeable future and that a significant portion of the Company\u2019s expenses, including personnel costs, as well as capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in Indian rupees. Consequently, the results of the Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected if the Indian rupee appreciates against the U.S. dollar and an effective foreign exchange hedging is not in place.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully manage the rapid growth of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has recently experienced a period of rapid growth in revenues that places significant demands on the Company\u2019s managerial, administrative and operational resources. Additionally, the longer-term transition in the Company\u2019s delivery mix from onsite to offshore staffing has also placed additional operational and structural demands on the Company. The Company\u2019s future growth depends on recruiting, hiring and training professionals, increasing the Company\u2019s international operations, expanding its U.S. and offshore capabilities, adding effective sales and management staff and adding service offerings. Effective management of these and other growth initiatives will require that the Company continue to improve its infrastructure, execution standards and ability to expand services. Failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the quality of the Company\u2019s services and engagements, the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain professionals, the Company\u2019s prospects and the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected if the Company does not anticipate and respond to technology advances in the Company\u2019s and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 industries.\nThe Company\u2019s business will suffer if the Company fails to anticipate and develop new services and enhance existing services in order to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and in the industries on which the Company focuses. The technology services and KPO markets are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences and frequent new product and service introductions. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on the Company\u2019s ability to anticipate these advances and develop new product and service offerings to meet the Company\u2019s existing and potential clients\u2019 needs. The Company may fail to anticipate or respond to these advances in a timely manner, or, if the Company does respond, the services or technologies the Company develops may not be successful in the marketplace. Further, products, services or technologies that are developed by the Company\u2019s competitors may render the Company\u2019s services non-competitive or obsolete. If the Company does not respond effectively to these changes, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company may be required to include benchmarking provisions in future engagements, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nAs the size and duration of the Company\u2019s client engagements increase, the Company\u2019s current and future clients may require benchmarking provisions. Benchmarking provisions generally allow a client in certain circumstances to request that a benchmark study be prepared by an agreed-upon third-party comparing the Company\u2019s pricing, performance and efficiency gains for delivered contract services to that of an agreed-upon list of other service providers for comparable services. Based on the results of the benchmark study and depending on the reasons for an unfavorable variance, if any, the Company could then be required to reduce the pricing for future services to be performed under the balance of the contract or to change the services being provided under the contract, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nThe Company may be liable to its clients for disclosure of confidential information or if the Company does not fulfill its obligations under its engagements.\nThe Company may be liable to the Company\u2019s clients for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures. The Company is often required to collect and store sensitive or confidential client data. Many of the Company\u2019s client agreements do not limit its potential liability for breaches of confidentiality. If any person, including any of the Company\u2019s employees, penetrates the Company\u2019s network security or misappropriates sensitive data, the Company could be subject to significant liability from its clients or from their customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data, whether through breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems, systems failure or otherwise, could also damage the Company\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose existing and potential clients. Many of the Company\u2019s engagements involve IT services that are critical to the operations of the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 businesses. Any failure or inability to meet a client\u2019s expectations in the performance of services could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company\u2019s responsibility\nfor such failure. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in the Company\u2019s service contracts will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect the Company from liability for damages. In addition, the costs of defending against any such claims, even if successful, could be significant.\nAlthough the Company maintains general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms, will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or defense costs, or that the Company\u2019s insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against the Company that are uninsured, exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes to the Company\u2019s insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on global telecommunications infrastructure to maintain communication between its various locations and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 sites.\nDisruptions in telecommunications, system failures, or virus attacks could harm the Company\u2019s ability to execute the Company\u2019s Global Delivery Model, which could result in client dissatisfaction and a reduction of the Company\u2019s revenues. A significant element of the Company\u2019s Global Delivery Model is to continue to leverage and expand the Company\u2019s Global Development Centers. The Company\u2019s Global Development Centers are linked with a redundant telecommunications network architecture that uses multiple service providers and various satellite and optical links with alternate routing. The Company may not be able to maintain active voice and data communications between its various Global Development Centers and between the Company\u2019s Global Development Centers and the Company\u2019s clients\u2019 sites at all times due to disruptions in these networks, system failures or virus attacks. Any significant failure in the Company\u2019s ability to communicate could result in a disruption in business, which could hinder the Company\u2019s performance or its ability to complete projects on time. This, in turn, could lead to client dissatisfaction and a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s investment in new facilities and physical infrastructure.\nThe Company\u2019s business model includes developing and operating Global Development Centers in order to support the Company\u2019s Global Delivery Service. The Company has Global Development Centers located in Pune, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Chennai, India and in Manila, Philippines. The Company is in the process of expanding its Global Development Centers, often on land located in Special Economic Zones (SEZ)in India. With regard to construction on land located in a SEZ, there are certain construction and other requirements that must be met in order to maximize certain tax and other benefits. If those conditions are not met, Syntel may not be able to maximize all benefits associated with the SEZ designations. The full completion of the development of these facilities is contingent on many factors including the Company\u2019s funding the continuation of the construction and obtaining appropriate construction and other permits from\nthe Indian government. The Company cannot make any assurances that the construction of these facilities or any future facilities that the Company may develop will occur on a timely basis or that they will be completed. If the Company is unable to complete the construction of these facilities, the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition will be adversely affected. In addition, the Company is developing these facilities in expectation of increased growth in the Company\u2019s business. If the Company\u2019s business does not grow as expected, the Company may not be able to benefit from its investment in this or other facilities.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected if the Company does not protect its intellectual capital or if the Company\u2019s services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on certain methodologies, practices, tools and technical expertise the Company utilizes in designing, developing, implementing and maintaining applications and other proprietary intellectual capital. In order to protect the Company\u2019s rights in this intellectual capital, the Company relies upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret, copyright and trademark laws. The Company also generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, clients and potential clients and limits access to and distribution of the Company\u2019s proprietary information.\nThe Company holds several trademarks or service marks and intends to submit additional United States federal and foreign trademark applications for the names of additional service offerings in the future. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in maintaining existing or obtaining future trademarks. There can be no assurance that the laws, rules, regulations and treaties in effect now or in the future or the contractual and other protective measures the Company takes are adequate to protect it from misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Company\u2019s intellectual capital or that such laws, rules, regulations and treaties will not change. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce the Company\u2019s rights or that any such steps will be successful. Misappropriation by others of the Company\u2019s intellectual capital, including the costs of enforcing the Company\u2019s intellectual capital rights, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. However, the Company is not significantly dependent on the referenced trademarks in the conduct of its business.\nAlthough the Company believes that its intellectual capital does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted against the Company in the future or that any such claim, if asserted, would not be successful. The costs of defending any such claims could be significant and any successful claim could require the Company to modify, discontinue or change the manner in which the Company provides its services. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings are affected by issuance of stock-based awards to employees and directors.\nThe Company expenses stock-based awards in accordance with provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance. The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payments at fair value. The Company has issued shares of incentive restricted stock to its non-employee directors and employees. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded $7.2 million of expense for equity-based compensation (including charges for restricted stock and dividend). The assumptions used in calculating and estimating future costs are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions could significantly affect the Company\u2019s future earnings.\nAny future business combinations, acquisitions or mergers would expose the Company to risks, including that the Company may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses.\nThe Company may expand its operations through the acquisition of other businesses. Financing of any future acquisition could require the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of equity (common or preferred) or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses without substantial expense, delays or other operational or financial risks and problems. Furthermore, acquisitions may involve a number of special risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key acquired personnel, unanticipated events or legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In addition, any client satisfaction or performance problems within an acquired firm could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation as a whole. There can be no assurance that any acquired businesses would achieve anticipated revenues and earnings. Any failure to manage the Company\u2019s acquisition strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to repatriate earnings from its foreign operations.\nThe Company treats earnings from its operations in India and other foreign countries as permanently invested outside the United States. If the Company repatriates any of such earnings, the Company will incur a dividend distribution tax for distribution from India, currently 17.647% on gross distribution (including tax on dividend distribution tax) under Indian tax law, and be required to pay United States corporate income taxes on such earnings. If the Company decided to repatriate all undistributed repatriable earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015, the Company would accrue taxes of approximately $306.0 million.\nEnvironmental regulations to which the Company is subject could increase its costs and liabilities, reduce its profits or limit its ability to run its business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and the properties it owns and develops (primarily located in India) are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including requirements addressing: health and safety; the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; discharges of waste materials into the environment, such as refuse or sewage; and air emissions. Complying with these laws and regulations, or addressing violations arising under them, could result in environmental costs and liabilities, reduce the Company\u2019s profits or limit its ability to run its business. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to the Company. The identification of areas of contamination, changes in cleanup requirements, or the adoption of new requirements governing the Company\u2019s operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results or operations, financial condition and business.", "PERMNO": 85319, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SYNT"}
