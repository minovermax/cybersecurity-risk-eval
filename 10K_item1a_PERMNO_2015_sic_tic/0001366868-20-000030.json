{"cik": "1366868", "company": "Globalstar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all of the information in this Report and all of the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating and understanding us and our business. Additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business operations and the risks identified in this Report may adversely affect our business in ways we do not currently anticipate. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe implementation of our business plan and our ability to generate income from operations assume we are able to maintain a healthy constellation and ground network capable of providing commercially acceptable levels of coverage and service quality, which are contingent on a number of factors.\nOur products and services are subject to the risks inherent in relying on a large-scale, complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology. Any disruption to our satellites, services, information systems or telecommunications infrastructure could result in degrading or disrupting services to our customers for an indeterminate period of time.\nSince we launched our first satellites in the 1990\u2019s, most of our first-generation satellites have been retired or have failed in orbit, and we expect the remaining first-generation satellites to be retired or fail in the future. Although we designed our second-generation satellites to provide commercial service over a 15-year life, we can provide no assurance as to whether any or all of them will continue in operation for their full 15-year design life. Satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and therefore are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit.\nFurther, our satellites may experience temporary outages or otherwise may not be fully functioning at any given time. There are some remote tools we use to remedy certain types of problems affecting the performance of our satellites, but the physical repair of satellites in space is not feasible. We do not insure our satellites against in-orbit failures after an initial period of six months, whether the failures are caused by internal or external factors. In-orbit failure may result from various causes, including component failure, solar array failures, telemetry transmitter failures, loss of power or fuel, inability to control positioning of the satellite, solar or other astronomical events, including solar radiation and flares, and collision with space debris or other satellites. These failures are commonly referred to as anomalies. Some of our satellites have had malfunctions and other anomalies in the past and may have anomalies in the future. Further, from time to time we move and relocate satellites within our constellation to improve coverage and service quality. Satellite repositioning may increase the risk of collision or damage to our satellites and may result in degraded service during the repositioning. Although we do not incur any direct cash costs related to the failure of a satellite, if a satellite fails, we record an impairment charge in our statement of operations to reduce the remaining net book value of that satellite, if any, to zero, and any such impairment charges could depress our net income (or increase our net loss) for the period in which the failure occurs. Additionally, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite's performance.\nPrior to 2014 our ability to generate revenue and cash flow was impacted adversely by our inability to offer commercially acceptable levels of Duplex service due to the degradation of our first-generation constellation. As a result, we improved the design of our second-generation constellation to last twice as long in space and have 40% greater capacity compared to our first-generation constellation. Despite working closely with satellite manufacturers to determine the causes of anomalies and mitigate them in second-generation satellites and to provide for intrasatellite redundancies for certain critical components to minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of failure, anomalies are likely to be experienced in the future, whether due to the types of anomalies described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components, and intrasatellite redundancy may not be available upon the occurrence of such anomalies. There can be no assurance that, in these cases, it will be possible to restore normal operations. Where service cannot be restored, the failure could cause the satellite to have less capacity available for service, to suffer performance degradation or to cease operating prematurely, either in whole or in part. We cannot guarantee that we could successfully develop and implement a solution to these anomalies.\nIn order to maintain commercially acceptable service long-term, we must obtain and launch additional satellites from time to time. We cannot provide any assurance that negotiations with satellite manufacturers will be successful or at commercially reasonable prices.\nOur ground stations required upgrades to enable us to integrate our second-generation technology and services. We entered into various contracts to upgrade our ground network. During 2016 we completed this work according to the Hughes and Ericsson contracts. In connection with the 2018 launch of Sat-Fi2 \u00ae, the first device to operate on our upgraded ground network, we placed into service the portion of the next-generation ground component (including associated developed technology and software upgrades), which represented the gateways capable of supporting commercial traffic at that time. Certain other gateways around the world have since been placed into service and others are expected to be placed into service in the coming months. The installation of RANs at additional sites outside the scope of the core Hughes contract will occur over time, and the completion of these upgrades may not be successful.\nIf we experience operational disruptions with respect to our gateways or operations center, we may not be able to provide service to our customers.\nOur satellite network traffic is supported by 22 gateways distributed around the globe. We operate our satellite constellation from our Network Operations Control Centers at three locations (France, California and Louisiana) to provide geo-redundancy and ongoing coverage. Our gateway facilities are subject to the risk of significant malfunctions or catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events and would be difficult to replace or repair and could require substantial lead-time to do so. In North America, we have implemented contingency coverage which allows neighboring gateways to provide services in the event of a gateway failure. Material changes in the operation of these facilities may be subject to prior FCC approval, and the FCC might not give such approval or may subject the approval to other conditions that could be unfavorable to our business. Our gateways and operations centers may also experience service shutdowns or periods of reduced service in the future as a result of equipment failure, delays in deliveries or regulatory issues. Any such failure would impede our ability to provide service to our customers, which could have a material impact on our business.\nThe actual orbital lives of our satellites may be shorter than we anticipate, and we may be required to reduce available capacity on our satellite network prior to the end of their orbital lives.\nWe anticipate that our second-generation satellites will have 15 year orbital lives. A number of factors will affect the actual commercial service lives of each satellite, including:\n\u2022\nthe amount of propellant used in maintaining the satellite's orbital location or relocating the satellite to a new orbital location (and, for a newly-launched satellite, the amount of propellant used during orbit raising following launch);\n\u2022\nthe durability and quality of its construction;\n\u2022\nthe performance of its components;\n\u2022\nhazards and conditions in space such as solar flares and space debris;\n\u2022\noperational considerations, including operational failures and other anomalies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in technology which may make all or a portion of our satellite fleet obsolete.\nIt is possible that the actual orbital lives of one or more of our existing satellites may also be shorter than originally anticipated. Further, it is possible that the total available payload capacity of a satellite may need to be reduced prior to the satellite reaching its end-of-orbital life. We periodically review the expected orbital life of each of our satellites using current engineering data. A reduction in the orbital life of any of our satellites could result in a reduction of the revenues generated by that satellite, the recognition of an impairment loss and an acceleration of capital expenditures. Reducing the available payload capacity prior to the end of a satellite's orbital life, if required, would reduce our revenues from the satellite. The potential impact on our revenues from a reduction in the orbital life of one or more satellites may vary depending on the satellite's orbital location as well as the type of device and service a customer is using.\nReplacing a satellite upon the end of its service life will require us to make significant expenditures.\nTo ensure no disruption in our business and to prevent loss of customers, we may be required to commence a multi-year process to construct and launch replacement satellites prior to the expected end of service life of the satellites then in orbit. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash, cash flow or be able to obtain third-party or shareholder financing to fund such expenditures on favorable terms, if at all. Should we not have sufficient funds available to replace our satellites, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nThe implementation of our business plan depends on increased demand for wireless communications services via satellite (including IoT applications) and via terrestrial mobile broadband networks, both for our existing services and products and for new services and products. If demand does not increase, our revenues and profitability may not increase as we expect.\nDemand for wireless communication services may not grow, or may decrease, either generally or in particular geographic markets, for particular types of services or during particular time periods. A lack of demand could impair our ability to sell our services and develop and successfully market new services, could exert downward pressure on prices, or both. This, in turn, could decrease our revenues and profitability and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and profitability over time.\nWe plan to introduce additional Duplex, SPOT and Commercial IoT products and services as well as low-power terrestrial mobile broadband services. However, we cannot predict with certainty the potential longer-term demand for these products and services or the extent to which we will be able to meet demand. Our business plan assumes we will grow our subscriber base. If we are not able to do so, it may adversely impact our business prospects.\nThe success of our business plan will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the health, capacity and control of our satellites;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the health of our ground network;\n\u2022\nour ability to influence the level of market acceptance and demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products and services that meet this market demand;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain current customers and obtain new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional business using our existing and future spectrum authority both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the costs of developing an integrated network providing related products and services, as well as our future terrestrial mobile broadband services;\n\u2022\nour ability to market successfully our Duplex, SPOT and Commercial IoT products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and deploy innovative network management techniques to permit mobile devices to transition between satellite and terrestrial modes;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell our current inventory;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of user equipment that operates on our network;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar products and services and in persuading our customers to switch service providers;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully predict market trends;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified executives, managers and employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our target markets; and\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when required.\nWe incurred operating losses in the past three years and we are likely to continue incurring such losses.\nWe incurred operating losses of $64.0 million, $47.4 million and $68.4 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These losses resulted, in part, from depreciation expense related to our second-generation satellites, which we placed into service in 2010, 2011 and 2013, and ground infrastructure, which we began to place into service in 2018. We designed our second-generation network to have a 15-year life, and we expect that we will continue to recognize high levels of depreciation expense commensurate with its estimated useful life.\nRapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant capital expenditures, which may require additional capital that has not been arranged.\nThe space and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology. New technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying consumer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards. Particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, greater flexibility, greater efficiency or greater capabilities, as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies. We must continue to commit to make significant capital expenditures to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive. Customer acceptance of the services and products that we offer will continually be affected by the technology in our product and service offerings relative to competitive offerings. New technologies may be protected by patents and therefore may not be available to us. We expect to face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems.\nThe hardware and software we utilize in operating our first-generation gateways were designed and manufactured over 20 years ago and portions have deteriorated. This original equipment may become less reliable as it ages and will be more difficult and expensive to service. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement parts for the hardware before the new equipment and software is fully deployed. Some of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateways are significantly customized and tailored to meet our requirements and specifications and could be difficult and expensive to service, upgrade or replace. Although we maintain inventories of some spare parts, it nonetheless may be difficult, expensive or impossible to obtain replacement parts for our hardware due to a limited number of parts being manufactured to our requirements and specifications. In addition, our business plan contemplates updating or replacing some of the hardware and software in our network as technology advances, but the complexity of our requirements and specifications may present us with technical and operational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it expensive or infeasible to carry out such upgrades and replacements. If we are not able to suitably service, upgrade or replace our equipment, it could harm our ability to provide our services and generate revenue.\nOur business is capital intensive. We may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business.\nImplementation of our business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue business strategies and seek to respond to developments in our business and opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future. In addition, if one of our satellites failed unexpectedly, there can be no assurance of insurance recovery for our losses or the timing thereof, and we may need to obtain additional financing to replace the satellite. If we determine that we need to obtain additional funds through external financing and are unable to do so, we may be prevented from fully implementing our business strategy.\nWe have substantial contractual obligations, which may require additional capital, the terms of which have not been arranged. The terms of our Facility Agreement could complicate raising additional capital.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our current sources of liquidity include cash on hand ($7.6 million), restricted cash ($0.6 million) and future cash flows from operations. We also have non-current restricted cash ($50.9 million), which consists primarily of a debt service reserve account, which is pledged to secure all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement. This account will be used towards the final scheduled principal payment due upon maturity. Our operating expenses for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019 were $195.8 million.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include primarily paying our debt service obligations and funding our operating costs. We cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a liquidity shortfall in the short or long-term.\nRestrictions in our Facility Agreement and our Second Lien Term Loan Facility limit the types of financings we may undertake and our discretion over the use of net cash proceeds from certain future financings. See Note 6: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our debt agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing when required on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain it in a timely manner, we may be unable to execute our business plan and fulfill our financial commitments.\nIf we do not develop, acquire and maintain proprietary information and intellectual property rights, it could limit the growth of our business and reduce our market share.\nOur business depends on technical knowledge, and we base our business plan in part on our ability to keep up with new technological developments and incorporate them in our products and services. We own or have the right to use our patents, work products, inventions, designs, software, systems and similar know-how. Our proprietary information may be disclosed to others, or others may independently develop similar information, systems and know-how. Protection of our information, systems and know-how may result in litigation, the cost of which could be substantial. Third parties may assert claims that our products or services infringe on their proprietary rights. Any such claims, if made, may prevent or limit our sales of products or services or increase our costs.\nWe license much of the software we require to support critical gateway operations from third parties, such as Hughes, Ericsson and Qualcomm. This software was developed or customized specifically for our use. We also license technical information for the design, manufacture and sale of our products. This intellectual property is essential to our ability to continue to operate our constellation and sell our products and services. We also license software to support customer service functions, such as billing, from third parties that developed or customized it specifically for our use. If the third-party licensors cease to support and service our software, or our licenses are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, it might be difficult, expensive or impossible for us to obtain such services from alternative vendors. Replacing such software could be difficult, time consuming and expensive. This might require us to obtain substitute technology with lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost.\nOthers may claim that our products violate their patent or intellectual property rights, which could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry fraught with significant intellectual property litigation. Intellectual property infringement claims or litigation may be brought against us. Defending intellectual property suits is both costly and time-consuming and, even if ultimately successful, may divert management's attention from other business concerns. An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could, among other things:\n\u2022subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, including treble damages;\n\u2022require disputed rights to be licensed from a third party for royalties that may be substantial;\n\u2022require us to cease using technology that is important to our business; or\n\u2022prohibit us from selling some or all of our products or offering some or all of our services.\nWe have a limited supply of Duplex handsets and rely on a limited number of key vendors for timely supply of equipment and services. If our key vendors fail to provide equipment and services to us, we may face difficulties in finding alternative sources, which would adversely impact our operations.\nWe have a limited quantity of our Duplex handsets in inventory and have not contracted with a manufacturer to produce additional phone inventory. We have a \"buy-back\" program with former customers and we have seen meaningful success re-offering refurbished handsets into the market in an effort to mitigate the lack of new handset inventory. However, the number of devices received from the \"buy-back\" may not be sufficient to meet our customers' demand. Additionally, in some cases we contract with manufacturers to provide us with other equipment inventory for the devices we sell. If these manufacturers do not take on or fulfill future orders or fail to perform under our current contracts, we may be unable to continue producing and selling this equipment to customers at a reasonable cost to us, or there may be delays in production and decreases in sales.\nLack of availability of components from the electronics industry, required in our retail products, gateways and satellites could delay or adversely impact our operations.\nWe rely upon the availability of components, materials and component parts from the electronics industry. The electronics industry is subject to occasional shortages in parts availability depending on fluctuations in supply and demand. Industry shortages may result in delayed shipments of materials or increased prices, or both. As a consequence, elements of our operation which use electronic parts, such as our retail products, gateways and satellites, could be subject to disruptions, cost increases or both.\nWe face special risks by doing business in international markets and developing markets, including currency and expropriation risks, which could increase our costs or reduce our revenues in these areas.\nAlthough our most economically important geographic markets currently are the United States and Canada, we have substantial markets for our mobile satellite services in, and our business plan includes, developing countries or regions that are underserved by existing telecommunications systems, such as rural Brazil, Central America, Argentina and Africa. Developing countries are more likely than industrialized countries to experience market, currency and interest rate fluctuations and high inflation. In addition, these countries present risks relating to government policy, price, wage and exchange controls, social instability, expropriation and other adverse economic, political and diplomatic conditions.\nConducting operations outside the United States involves numerous special risks and expanding our international operations would increase these risks. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers;\n\u2022\nlack of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services;\n\u2022\nlack of recognition of our products and services;\n\u2022\nunavailability of or difficulties in establishing relationships with distributors;\n\u2022\nsignificant investments, including the development and deployment of dedicated, physical gateways in countries that require them to connect the traffic coming to and from their territory;\n\u2022\ninstability of international economies and governments;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nnoncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the UK Bribery Act, sanctions laws and export controls;\n\u2022\nexposure to varying legal standards in other jurisdictions, including intellectual property protection and other similar laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nvariations in local domestic ownership requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirements that operational activities be performed in-country;\n\u2022\nchanging and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls.\nThese risks could affect our ability to compete successfully and expand internationally. To the extent that the prices for our products and services are denominated in U.S. dollars, any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services to our international customers and, as a result, may reduce the competitiveness of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow internationally. Limited availability of U.S. currency in some local markets or governmental controls on the export of currency may prevent our customers from making payments in U.S. dollars or delay the availability of payment due to foreign bank currency processing and controls.\nOur operations involve transactions in a variety of currencies. Sales denominated in foreign currencies involve primarily the Canadian dollar, the euro and the Brazilian real. Accordingly, our operating results may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates for these currencies. Approximately 31% and 30% of our total revenue was to customers primarily located in Canada, Europe, Central America, and South America during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our results of operations for 2019 and 2018 included net gains of approximately $0.1 million and net losses of $3.1 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions. We may be unable to offset unfavorable currency movements as they adversely affect our revenue and expenses. Our inability to do so could have a substantial negative impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nOur global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions, other restrictions, liabilities and exposure to penalties imposed by the United States, the European Union and other governments and organizations.\nThe U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies require export licenses. They may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, distributors, consultants, IGOs, dealers and resellers, joint venture partners, independent agents, vendors, customers or subscribers have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. We cannot assure you that our business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us or result in us being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, OFAC restrictions or other export control, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom and European Union are important markets to our business. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell our products and services in the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) and throughout Europe. In particular, the United Kingdom is the largest market in Europe for our SPOT product family. On June 23, 2016, the UK voted in an advisory referendum for the UK to leave the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and, subsequently, on March 29, 2017, the UK government began the formal process of leaving the EU. The UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. The exit process (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) will involve the negotiation of new trade and other agreements.\nBrexit creates legal, regulatory, and economic uncertainty that could have a negative impact on our business. If the UK changes the regulatory structure for telecommunications products, it is possible that we would not be able to comply or compliance would become cost prohibitive. Similarly, post-Brexit trade agreements could impose import taxes or other expenses on our products, which may increase the price of our products sold in the UK.\nWe also face currency exchange risk as a result of Brexit. Although most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, we also receive payments in international currencies, including the pound and the euro. We therefore incur currency translation risk when currency values fluctuate and the U.S. dollar is strong relative to other currencies. Furthermore, a strong U.S. dollar increases the price of our products in international markets, which could reduce demand in those markets for our products.\nThe future consequences of Brexit are unknown at this time, but Brexit has created legal, regulatory, and currency risk that may have a materially adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, this uncertainty could negatively impact the economies of other countries in which we operate.\nWe face intense competition in all of our markets, which could result in a loss of customers, lower revenues and difficulty entering new markets.\nSatellite-based Competitors\nThere are currently at least three other MSS operators providing services similar to ours on a global or regional basis: Iridium, Thuraya and Inmarsat. ORBCOMM Inc. is also a competitor in the Machine-to-Machine and IoT market. The provision of satellite-based products and services is subject to downward price pressure when the capacity exceeds demand or as new competitors enter the marketplace with competitive pricing strategies. We also face competition with respect to network coverage and market share in specialized industries, such as maritime and governmental.\nOther providers of satellite-based products could introduce their own products similar to our SPOT, Commercial IoT or Duplex products, which may materially adversely affect our business plan and sales volume. In addition, we may face competition from new competitors or new technologies. Many companies target the same customers, and we may not be able to successfully retain our existing customers or attract new customers. As a result we may not grow our customer base and revenue.\nTerrestrial Competitors\nIn addition to our satellite-based competitors, terrestrial wireless voice and data service providers are continuing to expand into rural and remote areas, particularly in less developed countries. They provide the same general types of services and products that we provide through our satellite-based system. Many of these companies have greater resources, more name recognition and newer technologies than we do. Industry consolidation could adversely affect us by increasing the scale or scope of our competitors and thereby making it more difficult for us to compete. We could lose market share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from land-based communication service providers.\nAlthough satellite communications services and ground-based communications services are not identical, the two compete in similar markets with similar services. Consumers may perceive cellular voice communication products and services as cheaper and more convenient than satellite-based products and services.\nTerrestrial Broadband Network Competitors\nWe also expect to compete with a number of other satellite companies that plan to develop terrestrial networks that utilize their MSS spectrum. DISH Network received FCC approval to offer terrestrial wireless services over the MSS spectrum that previously belonged to TerreStar and ICO Global. Further, Ligado Networks (formerly LightSquared) continues to seek final FCC approval to build out a wireless network utilizing its MSS spectrum. Any of these competitors could deploy terrestrial mobile broadband networks before we do, could combine with existing terrestrial networks that provide them with greater financial or operational flexibility than we have or could offer wireless services, including mobile broadband services, that customers prefer over ours.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the principal balance of our debt obligations was $528.4 million, consisting of $190.4 million under the Facility Agreement, $201.5 million under the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, $135.1 million outstanding under the Loan Agreement with Thermo and $1.4 million under the 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013 (the \"2013 8.00% Notes\"). Our significant indebtedness could have several consequences. It could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments by dictating that a substantial portion of cash flow from operations be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, return of capital to shareholders, and future business opportunities. Our indebtedness could restrict us from making strategic acquisitions by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Our indebtedness could restrict us from paying dividends to our shareholders. It could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who are not as highly leveraged as us and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting. Additionally, even though our current debt agreements place limits on our ability to incur additional debt, in the future we may incur additional debt which could further exacerbate these risks.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements may limit our operating and financial flexibility and our inability to comply with these covenants could have significant implications.\nOur Facility Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Facility contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants. See Note 6: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. Complying with these restrictive covenants, including financial and non-financial covenants in our Facility Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Facility, as well as those that may be contained in any agreements governing future indebtedness, may impair our ability to finance our operations or capital needs or to take advantage of favorable business opportunities. Our facility agreements include a limitation on expenditures in connection with spectrum rights of $20 million, which may prohibit us from making certain expenditures that we consider accretive to our business and would otherwise make. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. Our failure to comply with these covenants would be an event of default. An event of default under the Facility Agreement or the Second Lien Term Loan Facility would permit the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness under these agreements. That acceleration would permit holders of our obligations under other agreements that contain cross-acceleration provisions to accelerate our obligations to them. See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Report for further discussion.\nPursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional costs, obligations and risks.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, partnerships or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis. We may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions. These may include legal, operational, financial and other costs and risks. For instance, in 2018, we incurred approximately $11.2 million in costs for consultants and other advisors related to the now-terminated merger (and related litigation) discussed in Note 12: Related Party Transactions and Note 10: Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.\nIn addition, if we choose to engage in any major business combination or similar strategic transaction, we may require significant external financing in connection with the transaction. Depending on market conditions, investor perceptions of us, and other factors, we may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction. Our Facility Agreement and other debt obligations contain covenants which limit our ability to engage in specified forms of capital transactions without lender consent, which may be impossible to obtain. Any such financing, if obtained, may further dilute our existing stockholders.\nOur networks and those of our third-party service providers and customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized or unlawful access. Our use of personal information could give rise to costs and liabilities arising from developing data privacy laws.\nOur network and those of our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, attacks, malware, data breaches and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information from such networks or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations. A data breach or network disruption could harm our reputation, cause demand for our products and services to fall or compromise our ability to pursue our business plans. A number of significant, widespread security breaches compromised companies and governmental agencies. In some cases, these breaches originated from outside the United States. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. In addition, our customer contracts may not adequately protect us against liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business.\nWe collect and store data, including our customers' personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is increasingly becoming the subject of extensive legislation and regulations to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and security, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in 2018. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and ever evolving. These laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or change our business practices. Our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, and some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, services or existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations across numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we could face liability to end users alleging that their personal information is not collected, stored, transmitted, used or disclosed appropriately or in accordance with our privacy policies or applicable laws, including claims and litigation resulting from such allegations. Any failure on our part to protect information pursuant to applicable regulations could result in a loss of user confidence, reputation and customers, which could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to fluctuations in the insurance market, we may be unable to obtain and maintain our insurance coverages, and the insurance we obtain may not cover all risks we undertake. As a result, we may incur material uninsured or under-insured losses.\nThe price, terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services. The cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures or general conditions in the insurance industry. Rising premiums on insurance policies could increase our costs. In addition to higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles, shorter coverage periods and additional policy exclusions. Our insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to maintain sufficient insurance could also create an event of default under our debt agreements. Our insurance may not adequately cover losses incurred arising from claims brought against us or otherwise, which could be material.\nProduct Liability Insurance and Product Replacement or Recall Costs\nWe are subject to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products and services are alleged to have caused injury to persons or damage to property. If any of our products prove to be defective, we may need to recall and redesign them. In addition, any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We do not maintain any product recall insurance, so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We investigate potential quality issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers.\nBecause consumers may use SPOT products and services in isolated or dangerous locations, users of our devices who suffer injury or death may seek to assert claims against us alleging failure of the device to facilitate timely emergency response. We cannot assure investors that any legal disclaimers will be effective or insurance coverage will be sufficient to protect us from material losses.\nGeneral Liability Insurance In-Orbit Exposures\nOur liability policy, covers amounts up to \u20ac70 million per occurrence (with a \u20ac70 million annual limit) that we and other specified parties may become liable to pay for bodily injury and property damages to third parties related to processing, maintaining and operating our satellite constellation. Our current policy has a one-year term, which expires in October 2020. Our current in-orbit liability insurance policy contains, and we expect any future policies would likewise contain, specified exclusions and material change limitations customary in the industry. These exclusions may relate to, among other things, losses resulting from in-orbit collisions, acts of war, insurrection, terrorism or military action, government confiscation, strikes, riots, civil commotions, labor disturbances, sabotage, unauthorized use of the satellites and nuclear or radioactive contamination, as well as claims directly or indirectly occasioned as a result of noise, pollution, electrical and electromagnetic interference or interference with the use of property.\nOur in-orbit insurance does not cover losses that might arise as a result of a satellite failure, other operational problems affecting our constellation, or damage resulting from de-orbiting a satellite. As a result, a failure of one or more of our satellites or the occurrence of equipment failures, collision damage, or other related problems that may result during the de-orbiting process could constitute an uninsured loss and could materially harm our financial condition.\nOur satellites may collide with space debris which could adversely affect the performance of our constellation.\nOur ability to maneuver our satellites to avoid potential collisions with space debris is limited by, among other factors, uncertainties and inaccuracies in the projected orbit location of, and predicted conjunctions with, debris objects tracked and cataloged by the U.S. government. Some space debris is too small to be tracked, and therefore its orbital location is completely unknown. Debris that cannot be tracked is still large enough to potentially cause severe damage to or failure of one of our satellites should a collision occur. If our constellation experiences satellite collisions with space debris, our service could be impaired. Any such collision could potentially expose us to significant losses.\nWe operate in many tax jurisdictions, and changes in tax rates or adverse results of tax examinations could materially increase our costs.\nWe operate in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The process of determining our anticipated tax liabilities involves many calculations and estimates which are inherently complex. Our tax obligations are subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions, such as the ongoing income tax return audit being conducted by the Canada Revenue Agency of our Canadian subsidiary. If taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our current tax positions, or if we changed the manner in which we conduct certain activities, we could become subject to material, unanticipated tax liabilities. We may also become subject to additional tax liabilities as a result of changes to tax laws in any of our applicable tax jurisdictions, which in certain circumstances could have a retroactive effect.\nOur revenues are subject to changes in global economic conditions and consumer sentiment and regarding discretionary spending.\nFinancial markets are uncertain and could adversely impact global economic conditions. These conditions could lead to reduced consumer spending, especially for discretionary travel and related products. A substantial portion of the potential addressable market for our consumer retail products and services relates to recreational users, such as mountain climbers, campers, kayakers, sport fishermen and wilderness hikers. These potential customers may reduce their recreational activities or discretionary spending due to economic conditions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of their obligations to us. Some of our customers may be highly leveraged or subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. From time to time, credit is less available and available on more restrictive terms. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers' liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could reduce our cash flows.\nTo illustrate, our Commercial IoT business is heavily concentrated in the oil and gas industry and was negatively impacted by the downturn in this industry in recent years. As an example, our largest customer during 2018 and 2019 is a reseller to oil and gas companies. A high-volume customer not performing its trade obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. Concentrations of customers in certain industries may further increase trade credit risk to our business if certain experience a similar economic downturn.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur obligations under our Facility Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. As a result, an increase in interest rates could result in a substantial increase in interest expense.\nAdditionally, in July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (\"FCA\") announced that the Libor rate would be phased out and financial institutions would no longer need to make Libor submissions after 2021. Our Facility Agreement provides for a fallback rate in the event Libor is unable to be determined. At this time, we cannot provide assurance of the impact this Libor phase out will have on our financial statements and internal processes.\nThe loss of skilled management and personnel could impair our operations.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance and institutional knowledge of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel. Further, we depend on the ability to attract talented employees to maintain consistent performance of our management, scientific and technical teams and the succession of institutional knowledge. Losing the services of any member of our senior management, scientific or technical staff or the inability to attract key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide communications service.\nNatural disasters could damage or destroy our ground stations and disrupt service to our customers. In addition, the collateral effects of disasters such as flooding may impair, damage or destroy our ground equipment. If a natural disaster were to impair, damage or destroy any of our ground facilities, we may be rendered unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area, either temporarily or indefinitely. Even if our gateways are not affected by natural disasters, our service could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages the public switch telephone network, terrestrial wireless networks or our ability to connect to the public switch telephone network or terrestrial wireless networks. Additionally, there are inherent dangers and risk associated with our satellite operations, including the risk of increased radiation. Any such failures or service disruptions could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have been in the past from time to time, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and investigations that could have a substantial, adverse impact on our business.\nFrom time to time we are subject to litigation, including claims related to our business activities, such as the securities claim, or Action, described in Note 10: Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report. We have also been in the past from time to time, and may be in the future, subject to investigations by regulators and governmental agencies, including from the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Irrespective of their merits, litigation and investigations may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. In our opinion there is no pending litigation, investigation, dispute or claim that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we may be wrong in this assessment. Additionally, in the future we may become subject to additional litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results, on the trading price of our securities and on our ability to access capital markets.\nWireless devices' radio frequency emissions are the subject of regulation and litigation concerning their environmental effects, which includes alleged health and safety risks. As a result, we may be subject to new regulations, demand for our services may decrease, and we could face liability based on alleged health risks.\nThere has been adverse publicity concerning alleged health risks associated with radio frequency transmissions from portable hand-held telephones that have transmitting antennas. Lawsuits have been filed against participants in the wireless communications industry alleging a number of adverse health consequences, including cancer, as a result of wireless phone usage. Other claims allege consumer harm from failures to disclose information about radio frequency emissions or aspects of the regulatory regimes governing those emissions. Although we have not been party to any such lawsuits, we may be exposed to such litigation in the future. Courts or governmental agencies could determine that we do not comply with applicable standards for radio frequency emissions and power or that there is valid scientific evidence that use of our devices poses a health risk. Any such finding could reduce our revenue and profitability and expose us and other communications service providers or device sellers to litigation, which, even if frivolous or unsuccessful, could be costly to defend.\nIf consumers' health concerns over radio frequency emissions increase, they may be discouraged from using wireless handsets. Further, government authorities might increase regulation of wireless handsets as a result of health concerns. Any actual or perceived risk from radio frequency emissions could reduce the number of our subscribers and demand for our products and services.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation, which mandates how we may operate our business and may increase our cost of providing services, slow our expansion into new markets and subject our services to additional competitive pressures.\nOur ownership and operation of an MSS system are subject to significant regulation in the United States by the FCC and in foreign jurisdictions by similar authorities. Additionally, our use of our licensed spectrum globally is subject to coordination by the ITU. Our second-generation constellation has been licensed and registered in France. The rules and regulations of the FCC or these foreign authorities may change and may not continue to permit our operations as currently conducted or as we plan to conduct them. Further, certain foreign jurisdictions may decide to allow additional uses within our ITU-allocation of spectrum that may be incompatible with our continued provision of MSS.\nFailure to provide services in accordance with the terms of our licenses or failure to operate our satellites, ground stations, or other terrestrial facilities (including those necessary to provide ancillary terrestrial component \"ATC\" services) as required by our licenses and applicable government regulations could result in the imposition of government sanctions against us, up to and including cancellation of our licenses.\nOur system requires regulatory authorization in each of the markets in which we or the IGOs provide service. We and the IGOs may not be able to obtain or retain all regulatory approvals needed for operations. Regulatory changes, such as those resulting from judicial decisions or adoption of treaties, legislation or regulation in countries where we operate or intend to operate, may also significantly affect our business. Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of the IGOs and/or persons with which we or they do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.\nOur current regulatory approvals could now be, or could become, insufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any additional necessary approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer services, and applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions could become unduly burdensome.\nOur operations are subject to certain regulations of the United States State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (the export of satellites and related technical data), United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (financial transactions and transactions with sanctioned persons or countries) and the United States Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (export of satellites and related technical data, our gateways and phones) and as well as other similar foreign regulations. These U.S. and foreign obligations and regulations may limit or delay our ability to offer products and services in a particular country. We may be required to provide U.S. and some foreign government law enforcement and security agencies with call interception services and related government assistance, in respect of which we face legal obligations and restrictions in various jurisdictions. These regulations may limit or delay our ability to operate in a particular country or engage in transactions with certain parties and may impose significant compliance costs. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. If we fail to comply with these regulations in any country, we could be subject to sanctions that could affect, materially and adversely, our ability to operate in that country. Failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to use our assigned radio frequency spectrum and to distribute our products in certain countries could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and on our overall competitive position.\nSpectrum values historically have been volatile, and may again be volatile in the future, which could cause the value of our business to fluctuate.\nOur business plan includes forming strategic partnerships to maximize the use and value of our spectrum, network assets and combined service offerings in the United States and internationally. Value that we may be able to realize from these partnerships will depend in part on the value ascribed to our spectrum. Historically, valuations of spectrum in other frequency bands have been volatile, and we cannot predict the future value that we may be able to realize for our spectrum and other assets. In addition, to the extent that the FCC makes additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater availability (e.g., via spectrum leasing or new spectrum sales) of existing satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, the availability of such additional spectrum could reduce the value that we are able to realize for our spectrum.\nOur business plan to use our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services depends upon action by third parties, which we cannot control.\nOur business plan includes utilizing our licensed MSS spectrum to provide terrestrial wireless services, including mobile broadband applications, around the world. In support of these plans, in December 2016, the FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing rules permitting us to offer such services. In August 2017, the FCC modified Globalstar's MSS licenses, granting it authority to provide terrestrial broadband services over approximately 11.5 MHz of its satellite spectrum at 2483.5 MHz to 2495.0 MHz. Globalstar\u2019s MSS licenses, including its terrestrial authority, are valid through various specified terms, which we will seek to renew. In addition, we will need to comply with certain conditions in order to provide terrestrial broadband service under our MSS licenses, including obtaining FCC certifications for our equipment that will utilize this spectrum authority. We are seeking similar approvals in various foreign jurisdictions, including applying for licenses and commencing due diligence efforts. We cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful.\nWe have entered into agreements with multiple third parties to develop an ecosystem of radios and devices using our terrestrially authorized spectrum. These third parties intend to use our terrestrially authorized spectrum to offer wireless services to their respective customers. Our anticipated future revenues and profitability is dependent upon the commercial success of their offerings. Further, we can provide no assurance that we can obtain authorizations to use our MSS spectrum for terrestrial wireless services in all countries, or any specific country. Nor can we provide any assurance that any particular country will not license the terrestrial use of our MSS spectrum to a third party without our consent.\nOther future regulatory decisions could reduce our existing spectrum allocation or impose additional spectrum sharing agreements on us, which could adversely affect our services and operations.\nUnder the FCC's plan for MSS in our frequency bands, we must share frequencies in the United States with other licensed MSS operators. To date, there are no other authorized CDMA-based MSS operators and no pending applications for authorization. However, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may require us to share spectrum with other systems that are not currently licensed by the United States or any other jurisdiction. On February 11, 2013, Iridium filed its own petition for rulemaking seeking to have the FCC reallocate 2.725 MHz of \"Big LEO\" spectrum from 1616-1618.725 MHz for Iridium\u2019s exclusive use. Subsequently, Iridium modified its petition, requesting the ability to share additional spectrum licensed to Globalstar at 1616-1618.725 MHz. On November 1, 2017, Iridium withdrew its petition for rulemaking without prejudice. There can be no assurance, however, that Iridium will not file a similar petition for rulemaking in the future that requests either the redesignation of some amount of our 1.6 GHz spectrum for Iridium\u2019s exclusive use or the sharing of additional spectrum licensed to us. An adverse result in this proceeding could materially affect our ability to provide both one-way and two-way mobile satellite services.\nWe registered our second-generation constellation with the ITU through France rather than the United States. The French radio frequency spectrum regulatory agency, ANFR, submitted the technical papers filing to the ITU on our behalf in July 2009. As with the first-generation constellation, the ITU requires us to coordinate our spectrum assignments with other administrators and operators that use any portion of our spectrum frequency bands. We are actively engaged in but cannot predict how long the coordination process will take; however, we are able to use the frequencies during the coordination process in accordance with our national licenses.\nIn March 2014, the FCC adopted an order related to the 5 GHz band which, among other things, expanded the use of unlicensed terrestrial mobile broadband services within our C-band Forward Link (Earth Station to Satellite), which operates at 5091-5250 MHz. As part of this order, the FCC adopted certain technical requirements for the expanded unlicensed use within our licensed spectrum which were intended to protect our services from harmful interference. However, since the FCC order has been adopted, we have identified a noticeable increase in the ambient level of interference in the 5 GHz band. Although this increase does not currently affect the quality of our service to customers, should the noise floor rise above a certain level, we could experience a significant reduction in our satellite downlink capacity, resulting in degradation of quality of our service to customers. In May 2018, we petitioned the FCC to open a Notice of Inquiry to assess the potential future effects of continuing to allow unlicensed use of the 5 GHz band. We cannot assure you that the FCC will take any action in response to our Notice of Inquiry. Furthermore, other regulatory jurisdictions internationally may also consider similar expanded unlicensed use in the 5 GHz band that may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to provide mobile satellite services.\nIf the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend our licenses, our ability to operate may be curtailed.\nWe hold FCC licenses for the operation of certain of our satellites, our U.S. gateways and other ground facilities and our mobile earth terminals that are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy specified conditions or meet prescribed milestones. The FCC licenses are also subject to modification by the FCC. There can be no assurance that the FCC will renew the FCC licenses we hold. If the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend any FCC licenses we hold, or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective FCC licenses, then we may not be able to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services, which would have a material adverse effect on or business and operations.\nIf our French regulator, or any other regulator, revokes, modifies or fails to renew or amend our licenses, our ability to operate may be curtailed.\nWe hold licenses issued by, and subject to the continued regulatory jurisdiction of, the French Ministry for the Economy, Industry and Employment, French Ministry in charge of Space Activities (\"MESR\") and ARCEP, the French independent administrative authority of post and electronic communications regulations, for the operation of our second-generation satellites. These licenses are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy specified conditions or meet prescribed milestones. These licenses are also subject to modification by the French regulators. There can be no assurance that the French regulators will renew the licenses we hold. If MESR, ARCEP or other French regulators revoke, modify or fail to renew or amend the licenses we hold or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective French licenses, then we may not be able to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFurthermore, if we operate in any country without a valid license, we could face regulatory fines and criminal sanctions. We hold certain licenses in each country where our ground infrastructure is located. If we fail to maintain such licenses within any particular country, we may not be able to continue to operate the ground infrastructure located within that country, which could prevent us from continuing to provide mobile satellite communications services within that region. For example, ANATEL, the national telecommunications agency of Brazil, imposed a fine against us because we operated our gateway stations in Brazil without a valid license while we were working to renew such license. In October 2018, this matter was referred to the Brazil federal authorities, who are currently performing an investigation concerning the action of certain employees. We cannot predict the outcome of this investigation at this time, but the investigation and any potential penalties is limited to the certain employees being investigated.\nChanges in international trade regulations and other risks associated with foreign trade could adversely affect our sourcing from foreign manufacturers.\nWe source our products from both domestic and foreign contract manufacturers, the largest concentration of which being in China. The adoption of regulations related to the importation of products, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported goods, and changes in U.S. customs procedures could result in an increase in the cost of our products. Recently, the U.S. imposed increased tariffs on certain imports from China, including several of our products, resulting in lower gross margin on impacted products. The current tariffs could increase or expand to additional categories of products not currently covered. We cannot predict how any future tariffs or other trade restrictions will impact our business, but further trade restrictions on our products may result in further reductions to gross margin.\nAdditionally, delays in goods clearing customs or the disruption of international transportation lines used by us could result in our inability to deliver goods to customers in a timely manner or the loss of sales altogether. Current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues, such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products, could restrict the supply of components and materials used in production and increase our costs. Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE American but could be delisted in the future, which may impair our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the symbol \u201cGSAT.\u201d Broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell and/or make a market in our common stock if it were delisted, which may make it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock. Removal of our common stock from listing on the NYSE American may also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of our securities.\nAdditionally, if our common stock is not listed on a U.S. national stock exchange or approved for quotation and trading on a national automated dealer quotation system or established automated over-the-counter trading market, then holders of our 2013 8.00% Notes would have the option to require us to repurchase the notes, which we may lack sufficient financial resources to do.\nRestrictive covenants in our Facility Agreement do not allow us to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, which may affect the market for our shares.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Our Facility Agreement currently prohibits the payment of cash dividends. Any future dividend payments are within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock. Our inability to pay dividends may limit the market for our shares.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and there is a limited market for our shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure in the performance of our current or future satellites;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by research analysts, or any failure by us to meet or exceed any such estimates, or changes in the recommendations of any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock or the common stock of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in economic, political or market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated sales of common stock by our controlling stockholder or others;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of our industry peers; and\n\u2022\nannouncement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives.\nThe trading price of our common stock may also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the initial purchase price. Additionally, because we are a controlled company, there is a limited market for our common stock, and we cannot assure our stockholders that a trading market will further develop or persist. In periods of low trading volume, sales of significant amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our stock.\nThe future issuance of additional shares of our common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our current stockholders. We are authorized to issue 1.9 billion shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 1.5 billion shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, there were 535.5 million shares available for future issuance (of which 100 million are designated as preferred), of which approximately 233.4 million shares were contingently issuable upon the exercise of stock options, the conversion of convertible notes and the vesting of restricted stock awards. On February 19, 2020, Thermo converted the entire principal amount outstanding under its 2009 Loan Agreement resulting in the issuance of 200.1 million shares of common stock; these shares were included in the contingently issuable count as of December 31, 2019. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into, or exercisable for, common stock for raising capital or other business purposes. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe have issued and may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of our common stock. Currently, there are 100 million shares of preferred stock authorized. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, priorities and liquidation premiums and have preferential voting rights to those held by the holders of our common stock.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. Holders of our securities could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents, debt agreements and Delaware corporate law may discourage takeovers, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and convertible notes.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our debt agreements could hamper a third party's acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe election of our Minority Directors by a plurality of the vote of our stockholders other than Thermo;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that (i) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving us or any of our subsidiaries and (ii) any sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of Globalstar or any sale or transfer of assets of any of our subsidiaries which are material to us has to be approved by the Strategic Review Committee until such time as Thermo no longer beneficially owns at least 45% of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting rights or with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe division of our board of directors into three separate classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe fact that if Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, our directors will be able to be removed for cause only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibitions, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, on our stockholders acting by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibitions on our stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders or filling vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement, at such time when Thermo does not own a majority of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, that our stockholders must obtain a super-majority vote to amend or repeal our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions in our Facility Agreement and Second Lien Term Loan Facility, which provide that a change of control will constitute an event of default and, unless waived by the lenders, will result in the acceleration of the maturity of all indebtedness under that agreement;\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions relating to our 2013 8.00% Notes, which provide that a change of control will permit holders of those notes to demand immediate repayment; and\n\u2022\nchange of control provisions in our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, which provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.\nWe also are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision does not apply to Thermo, which became our principal stockholder prior to our initial public offering.\nThese provisions also could make it more difficult for our stockholders to take certain corporate actions, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are controlled by Thermo, whose interests may conflict with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Thermo owned approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock; additionally, Thermo owns convertible notes and warrants that may be converted into additional shares of common stock. As previously disclosed, in February 2020, Thermo converted the entire principal amount outstanding due under its 2009 Loan Agreement resulting in the issuance of 200.1 million shares of voting common stock; this issuance increased Thermo's ownership of common stock to approximately 63%. Although extraordinary corporate transactions, material sales of assets and certain transactions with related parties must be approved by the Strategic Review Committee, to the extent these and other matters are also subject to a vote of our shareholders, Thermo is able to control such vote. These matters include the election of certain members of our board of directors and numerous other matters, including changes of control and other significant corporate transactions, so long as these transactions are not between Thermo and Globalstar and until such time as Thermo shall no longer be the beneficial owner of 45% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe have depended substantially on Thermo to provide capital to finance our business. In 2006 and 2007, Thermo purchased an aggregate of $200 million of common stock at prices substantially above market. On December 17, 2007, Thermo assumed all of the obligations and was assigned all of the rights (other than indemnification rights) of the administrative agent and the lenders under our amended and restated credit agreement. To fulfill the conditions precedent to our Facility Agreement, in 2009, Thermo converted the loans outstanding under the credit agreement into equity and terminated the credit agreement. In addition, Thermo and its affiliates deposited $60.0 million in a contingent equity account to fulfill a condition precedent for borrowing under the Facility Agreement, purchased $20.0 million of our 5.0% Notes, which were subsequently converted into shares of common stock in 2013, purchased $11.4 million of our 2013 8.00% Notes, which were subsequently converted into shares of common stock, loaned us $37.5 million to fund our debt service reserve account under the Facility Agreement and funded a total of $65.0 million during 2013 pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment, Restructuring and Consent Agreement, the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. In June 2017, Thermo purchased $33.0 million of our common stock to provide funds required by our lenders to obtain an amendment to our Facility Agreement. In October 2017 and December 2018, Thermo purchased $43.3 million and $49.3 million, respectively, of our common stock in connection with our public stock offerings. In July 2019, Thermo loaned us $53.8 million in a Subordinated Loan Agreement with other unaffiliated lenders. In November 2019, the Subordinated Loan Agreement was paid in full with proceeds from the Second Lien Term Loan Facility, in which Thermo contributed an additional $41.3 million for a total principal loan amount of $95.1 million in the Second Lien Term Loan Facility.\nThermo is controlled by James Monroe III, our Executive Chairman. Through Thermo, Mr. Monroe holds equity interests in, and serves as an executive officer or director of, a diverse group of privately-owned businesses not otherwise related to us. We reimburse Thermo and Mr. Monroe for certain third party, documented, out-of-pocket expenses they incur in connection with our business.\nThe interests of Thermo may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Thermo may take actions it believes will benefit its equity investment in us or loans to us even though such actions might not be in your best interests as a holder of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91612, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GSAT"}
