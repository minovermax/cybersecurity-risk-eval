{"cik": "842717", "company": "BLUE RIDGE BANKSHARES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves certain risks, including those described below. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, capital position, and prospects. One or more of these could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nMarket Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and operations; the extent of such impacts are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGlobal health and economic concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have had a material adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty. The pandemic has resulted in federal, state and local authorities, including those who govern the markets in which the Company operates, implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus. These measures, including shelter in place orders and business limitations and shutdowns, have significantly contributed to higher unemployment and have negatively impacted consumer and business spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Company\u2019s workforce and operations and the operations of the Company\u2019s customers and business partners. In particular, the Company may experience adverse effects due to a number of operational factors impacting it or its customers or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nloan losses resulting from financial stress experienced by the Company\u2019s borrowers, especially those operating in industries hardest hit by government measures to contain the spread of the virus;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022\nas a result of the decline in the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on the Company\u2019s assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in the Company\u2019s cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing the Company\u2019s net interest margin and spread, and reducing net income;\n\u2022\noperational failures, disruptions, or inefficiencies due to changes in the Company\u2019s normal business practices necessitated by the Company\u2019s internal measures to protect its employees and government-mandated measures intended to slow the spread of the virus;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions experienced by the Company\u2019s vendors and business partners in carrying out work that supports the Company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and services due to economic uncertainty, volatile market conditions, and temporary business closures;\n\u2022\npotential financial liability, loan losses, litigation costs, or reputational damage resulting from the Company\u2019s origination of loans as a participating lender in the PPP administered by the SBA; and\n\u2022\nheightened levels of cyber and payment fraud, as cyber criminals try to take advantage of the disruption and increased online activity brought about by the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, its duration and severity, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. In addition, the rapidly changing and unprecedented nature of COVID-19 heightens the inherent uncertainty of forecasting future economic conditions and their impact on the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, thereby increasing the risk that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates used to determine the allowance for loan losses and other estimates are incorrect. As a result of these and other conditions, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and the Company cannot predict the full extent of the impacts on its business and operations. To the extent any of the foregoing risks or other factors that develop as a result of COVID-19 materialize, it could exacerbate the other risk factors discussed in this section, or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in economic conditions, especially in the areas in which the Company conducts operations, could materially and negatively affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is directly impacted by economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies, and inflation, all of which are beyond its control. A deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by global, national or local concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic), especially within the Company\u2019s market area, could result in the following potentially material consequences: loan delinquencies increasing; problem assets and foreclosures increasing; demand for products and services decreasing; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits decreasing; and collateral for loans, especially real estate, declining in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans. A continued economic downturn could result in losses that materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by changes in market conditions.\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. As a financial institution, market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with the Company\u2019s operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, and trading account assets and liabilities. A few of the market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing the Company to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity and futures prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of issuers. The Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio, in particular, may be impacted by market conditions beyond its control, including rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and inactivity or instability in the credit markets. Any changes in these conditions, in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact the Company\u2019s assessment of fair value and thus the determination of other-than-temporary impairment of the securities in the investment securities portfolio, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, capital ratios, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage banking revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profits.\nResidential mortgage banking income, net, represented approximately 78.2% of total noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The success of the Company\u2019s mortgage division is dependent upon its ability to originate loans and sell them to investors at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Revenues from mortgage banking have increased due to a lowering interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. Conversely, revenues are adversely affected by rising interest rates, home affordability and inventory, and changing incentives for homeownership. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, mortgage rates have generally fallen, creating the potential for renewed refinancing activity, but economic conditions have also deteriorated. Loan production levels may suffer if there is a sustained slowdown in the housing markets in which the Company conducts business or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by an economic downturn, fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure, or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect the Company\u2019s mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce its income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business and earnings are impacted by governmental, fiscal, and monetary policy over which it has no control.\nThe Company is affected by domestic monetary policy. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the Company\u2019s cost of funds for lending, investing, and capital raising activities and the return it earns on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin. The actions of the Federal Reserve also can materially affect the value of financial instruments that the Company holds, such as loans and debt securities, and also can affect the Company\u2019s borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. The Company\u2019s business and earnings also are affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States. Changes in fiscal or monetary policy are beyond the Company\u2019s control and hard to predict.\nThe Company faces strong and growing competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking and other financial services, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company encounters substantial competition from other financial institutions in its market area and competition is increasing. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that the Company offers in its service area. These competitors include national, regional and community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, mutual and money market fund providers, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, financial subsidiaries of certain industrial corporations, financial technology companies, and mortgage companies. Increased competition may result in reduced business for the Company.\nAdditionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loans and deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to continue to grow loan and deposit portfolios and its results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is thinly traded, and a more liquid market for its common stock may not develop, which may limit the ability of shareholders to sell their shares and may increase price volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the NYSE American market under the symbol \u201cBRBS\u201d. The Company\u2019s common stock is thinly traded and has substantially less liquidity than the trading markets for many other bank holding companies. Although the Company recently listed its common stock on the NYSE American market, the Company may be unable to maintain the listing of its common stock in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock will develop or if one develops, that it can be sustained. The development of a liquid public market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within the Company\u2019s control. Therefore, the Company\u2019s shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices, or times that they desire. Shareholders should be financially prepared and able to hold shares for an indefinite period.\nIn addition, thinly traded stocks can be more volatile than more widely traded stocks. The Company\u2019s stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, developments related to the Company\u2019s business and operations, stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, news reports of trends, concerns, and irrational exuberance on the part of investors, and other issues related to the financial services industry. The Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector of the economy, could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions, and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions, as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans and leases are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be insufficient and any increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents the Bank\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s evaluation of the level of loans outstanding, the level of non-performing loans, historical loan loss experience, delinquency trends, underlying collateral values, the amount of actual losses charged to the reserve in a given period and assessment of present and anticipated economic conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. The COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented governmental response have made these subjective judgements even more difficult. Although the Company believes the allowance for loan losses is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio, it cannot precisely predict such losses or be certain that the loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future. Deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside the Bank\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies and the Bank\u2019s auditors periodically review its allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Further, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Bank will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s non-performing assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. Non-performing assets, which include non-accrual loans and other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), were $6.6 million, or 0.44% of total assets, as of December 31, 2020. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to record the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increased level of non-performing assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in, or negative changes in, the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of non-performing assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including generation of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid increases in non-performing loans in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase its future credit losses, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are concentrated to borrowers who, as a group, may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 63.4% of the Company\u2019s loans and approximately 77.2% of Bay Banks\u2019 loans were secured by real estate, both residential and commercial, substantially all of which are located in their respective market areas. A major change in the region\u2019s real estate market, resulting in a deterioration in real estate values, or in the local or national economy, including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could adversely impact the Company. Risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent in the banking industry, and the Company tries to limit its exposure to this risk by carefully underwriting and monitoring its extensions of credit. The Company cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result, losses may occur in the future.\nThe Company has a moderate concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $273.5 million in loans secured by commercial real estate, representing approximately 23.4% of total loans outstanding at that date. As of December 31, 2020, Bay Banks had approximately $369.6 million in loans secured by commercial real estate, representing approximately 34.9% of total loans outstanding at that date. The real estate consists primarily of non-owner-occupied properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. It may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner, as commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful rental of their properties. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a sustained downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because the Company\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in its percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of construction and land development loans, and a decline in real estate values and economic conditions would adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 6.2% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio, or $72.7 million, and approximately 12.9% of Bay Banks\u2019 loan portfolio, or $137.1 million, consisted of construction and land development loans. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate and improved, income producing real estate. Risk of loss on a construction or land development loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction or development, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction or development. If the estimate of construction or development costs proves to be inaccurate, the Company may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, it may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders and developers, the cost breakdown of construction or development is provided by the builder or developer. Although the Company\u2019s underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction or land development loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance. Loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally riskier than loans secured by improved property. These loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.\nA significant source of risk for the Company is the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most of the Company\u2019s loans are secured but some loans are unsecured. With respect to the secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans. Collateral values may be adversely affected by changes in economic, environmental, and other conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, terrorist activity, environmental contamination, and other external events. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards may create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when it is not. The Company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and policies, including regular reviews of appraisals and borrower financial statements, that management believes are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties and the Company\u2019s financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading or incorrect information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which it does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the Company may assume that a client\u2019s audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of that client. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate that secures a significant portion of its loans and the value of foreclosed properties carried on its books, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if it is forced to foreclose upon such loans or liquidate such foreclosed property.\nAs indicated above, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate and it also holds a portfolio of foreclosed properties. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such\nreal estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company\u2019s loans and the foreclosed properties held by the Company may be more or less valuable than anticipated. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan. It may also be unable to sell its foreclosed properties for the values estimated by their appraisals.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of its business, the Company may foreclose and take title to real estate, potentially becoming subject to environmental liabilities associated with the properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs or the Company may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. Costs associated with investigation or remediation activities can be substantial. If the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nCombining the Company and Bay Banks may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s acquisition of Bay Banks will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of the Company and Bay Banks. To realize such anticipated benefits and cost savings, the Company must successfully combine the businesses of the Company and Bay Banks in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting existing customer relationships or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nUntil the completion of the merger in January 2021, the Company and Bay Banks operated independently. To realize anticipated benefits from the merger, the Company will continue to integrate Bay Banks\u2019s business into its own. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of the Company\u2019s ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that affect adversely the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in the markets it entered in connection with its merger with Bay Banks, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized, fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of the Bank and Virginia Commonwealth Bank.\nThe future operating performance of the Bank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger of the Bank and Virginia Commonwealth Bank. The success of the bank merger depends on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to (i) integrate operations and branches, (ii) retain deposits and customers, (iii) control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from the merger, and (iv) retain and integrate appropriate personnel and reduce overlapping personnel. The continued integration of the Bank and Virginia Commonwealth Bank will require the dedication of the time and resources of the Company\u2019s management team and may temporarily distract the management team\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the Company and the Bank. If the Bank and Virginia Commonwealth Bank are unable to successfully integrate, the Bank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully manage its long-term growth, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nA key aspect of the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy is its continued growth and expansion. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon its ability to (i) open new branch offices or acquire existing branches or other financial institutions, (ii) attract deposits to those locations, and (iii) identify attractive loan and investment opportunities.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy, if it is unable to identify attractive markets, locations, or opportunities to expand in the future, or if the Company is subject to regulatory restrictions on growth or expansion of its operations. The Company\u2019s ability to manage its growth successfully also will depend on whether it can maintain capital levels adequate to support its growth, maintain cost controls and asset quality, and successfully integrate any businesses the Company acquires into its organization. As the Company identifies opportunities to implement its growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or other banks, it may incur increased personnel, occupancy, and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, the Company must absorb those higher expenses while it begins to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding assets.\nThe Company has acquired and expanded into new product lines and may consider additional acquisitions and expansion into other businesses that it believes will help it fulfill its strategic objectives. The Company expects that other banking and financial companies, some of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with it to acquire financial services businesses. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that the Company believes are attractive. Acquisitions may also be subject to various regulatory approvals. If the Company fails to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, it will not be able to consummate acquisitions that it believes are in its best interests.\nWhen the Company enters into new markets or new lines of business, its lack of history and familiarity with those markets, clients and lines of business may lead to unexpected challenges or difficulties that inhibit its success. The Company\u2019s plans to expand could depress earnings in the short run, even if it efficiently executes a growth strategy leading to long-term financial benefits.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates and inadequate management of interest rate risk may negatively affect financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce the Company\u2019s profits. It is expected that the Company will continue to realize income from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities, and other interest earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and the current interest rate environment encourages extreme competition for new loan originations from qualified borrowers. The Company\u2019s management cannot ensure that it can minimize interest rate risk. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, and the Company\u2019s overall profitability.\nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak, market interest rates declined significantly, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond falling below 1.00% on March 3, 2020 for the first time in recent history. Such events also may adversely affect business and consumer confidence, generally, and the Company and its customers, and their respective suppliers, vendors, and processors may be adversely affected. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.00% to 1.25%. Subsequently, on March 16, 2020, the FOMC further reduced the target federal funds rate by an additional 100 basis points to 0.00% to 0.25%. These reductions in interest rates and related actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity needs could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s primary sources of funds are deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, availability of, and/or access to, sources of refinancing, business closings or lay-offs, pandemics or endemics, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, the Company may be required from time to time to\nrely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as additional out-of-market time deposits and brokered deposits. While the Company believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if the Company continues to grow experiences increasing loan demand or is unable to maintain its deposit base. The Company may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments, liquidate assets, or pay higher rates on deposits should such sources not be adequate.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and may not be able to do so on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAccess to sufficient capital is critical in order to enable the Company to implement its business plan, support its business, expand its operations and meet applicable capital requirements. The inability to have sufficient capital, whether internally generated through earnings or raised in the capital markets, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to support and to grow its operations. If the Company grows its operations faster than it generates capital internally, it will need to access the capital markets. The Company may not be able to raise additional capital in the form of additional debt or equity on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, the Company\u2019s financial condition and its results of operations. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and limit access to some sources of capital. Further, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and capital ratios.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors, without the approval of shareholders, could from time to time decide to issue additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, which may adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be dilutive to the Company\u2019s shareholders. Any sale of additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may be at prices lower than the current market value of the Company\u2019s shares. In addition, new investors may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that could adversely affect, the Company\u2019s existing shareholders. For example, preferred stock would be senior to common stock in right of dividends and as to distributions in liquidation. The Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of its future offerings of equity securities. Thus, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk of future offerings diluting their stock holdings, adversely affecting their rights as shareholders, and/or reducing the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRecently enacted capital standards, including the Basel III Capital Rules, may require the Company and the Bank to maintain higher levels of capital and liquid assets, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and return on equity.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that the Company and the Bank must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, its financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The Basel III Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain significantly more capital as a result of higher required capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk weightings and calculations. While the Company is exempt from these capital requirements under the Federal Reserve\u2019s SBHC Policy Statement, the Bank is not exempt and must comply. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDI Act. Satisfying capital requirements may require the Company to limit its banking operations, reduce dividends, or raise additional capital to improve regulatory capital levels, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The EGRRCPA, which became effective May 24, 2018, amended the Dodd-Frank Act to, among other things, provide relief from certain of these requirements. Although the EGRRCPA is still being implemented, the Company does not expect the EGRRCPA and the related rulemakings to materially reduce the impact of capital requirements on its business.\nThe Company is not obligated to pay dividends and its ability to pay dividends is limited.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the Bank. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of banks, such as the Bank, to pay dividends or make other payments to their holding companies. Although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of its common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and the Company is not obligated to pay dividends in any particular amounts or at any particular times. Regulatory, economic and other factors may cause the Company\u2019s board of directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on its common stock. See \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Dividends.\u201d\nRegulatory and Operational\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting or reporting, including changes in them or the Company\u2019s failure to comply with them, may adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the Company\u2019s business activities, limit the dividends or distributions that it can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee its debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in its capital than GAAP. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs.\nThe Company faces increasing regulation and supervision of its industry. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such additional regulation and supervision has increased, and may continue to increase, the Company\u2019s costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject it to restrictions on its business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, capital base and the price of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nRegulations issued by the CFPB could adversely impact earnings due to, among other things, increased compliance costs or costs due to noncompliance.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. For example, the CFPB has issued a final rule, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing and fees. The rule also contains additional disclosure requirements at mortgage loan origination and in monthly statements. The requirements under the CFPB\u2019s regulations and policies could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company is subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential, or proprietary information of individuals could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) in various information systems that the Company maintains and in those maintained by third- party service providers. The Company also maintains important internal company data such as PII about its employees and information relating to its operations. The Company is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of PII of individuals (including customers, employees and other third parties). For example, the Company\u2019s business is subject to the GLB Act, which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to share nonpublic PII about its customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that the Company provide\ncertain disclosures to customers about its information collection, sharing, and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by it with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that the Company develop, implement, and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on the Company\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information it processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various federal and state banking regulators and states have also enacted data breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory, or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that the Company\u2019s collection, use, transfer, and storage of PII complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase the Company\u2019s costs. Furthermore, the Company may not be able to ensure that customers and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential, or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused, the Company could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s measures to safeguard PII, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Company to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce its revenues. Accordingly, any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject the Company to inquiries, examinations, and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs. For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their effects on the Company, see \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 of the Company\u2019s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal control, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to maintain the operating effectiveness of the controls described above could result in a material misstatement to the Company\u2019s financial statements or other disclosures, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, any failure to maintain effective controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and FDIC regulations or to timely effect any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its management team, and the unexpected loss of any of these personnel could adversely affect operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success is, and is expected to remain, highly dependent on its management team. This is particularly true because, as a community bank, the Company depends on the management team\u2019s ties to the community and customer relationships to generate business. The Company\u2019s growth will continue to place significant demands on management, and the loss of any such person\u2019s services may have an adverse effect upon growth and profitability. If the Company fails to retain or continue to recruit qualified employees, growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s strategy depends on its ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in its markets.\nIn order to be successful, the Company must identify and retain experienced key management members and sales staff with local expertise and relationships. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and there is a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the community banking and mortgage industry in the Company\u2019s chosen geographic market. Even if the Company identifies individuals that it believes could assist it in building its franchise, it may be unable to recruit these individuals away from their current employers. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategy is often lengthy. The Company\u2019s inability to identify, recruit, and retain talented personnel could limit its growth and could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor and failure to handle current or higher volumes, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interface with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, operational errors, clerical or record-keeping errors, and errors resulting from faulty or disabled computer or communications systems.\nReputational risk, or the risk to the Company\u2019s earnings and capital from negative public opinion, could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract and keep customers and employees and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.\nFurther, if any of the Company\u2019s financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant issues, the Company could be adversely affected. The Company depends on internal systems and outsourced technology to support these data storage and processing operations. The Company\u2019s inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of the Company\u2019s business operations. It could be adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates its operations or systems. The Company is also at risk of the impact of natural disasters, terrorism, and international hostilities on its systems and from the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or communications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to\ncustomers and to financial loss or liability. In addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. Although the Company has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of its customers, it cannot guarantee that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPending litigation could result in a judgment against the Company resulting in the payment of damages.\nOn August 12, 2019, a former employee of VCB and participant in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the \u201cVCB ESOP\u201d) filed a class action complaint against VCB, Virginia Community Bank, and certain individuals associated with the VCB ESOP in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Charlottesville Division (Case No. 3:19-cv-00045-GEC). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to ESOP participants in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The complaint alleges that the ESOP incurred damages \u201cthat approach or exceed $12 million.\u201d The Company automatically assumed any liability of VCB in connection with this litigation as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of VCB. The outcome of this litigation is uncertain, and the plaintiff and other individuals may file additional lawsuits related to the VCB ESOP. The defense, settlement, or adverse outcome of any such lawsuit or claim could have a material adverse financial impact on the Company. The Company believes the claims are without merit.\nThe Company may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR index in the future.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021, but the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 30, 2023. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, federal bank regulators have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans, as well as LIBOR-based securities, subordinated notes, trust preferred securities, or other securities or financial arrangements. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s loan agreements with borrowers, subordinated notes that it has issued, or other financial arrangements may cause the Company to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers or other counter-parties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers, and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged, or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. Furthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, the Company may be required to expend significant additional financial and operational resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, multiple major U.S. companies have experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial or privileged data. These incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including the Bank. Although the Company\u2019s systems are not\nbreached in these incursions, these events can cause it to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Company and its customers. In some cases, the Company may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (cloud) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate profitably may be dependent on its ability to integrate or introduce various technologies into its operations.\nThe market for financial services, including banking and consumer finance services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, computers, automation, online banking and tele-banking. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully in its market may depend on the extent to which it is able to implement or exploit such technological changes. If the Company is not able to afford such technologies, properly or timely anticipate or implement such technologies, or effectively train its staff to use such technologies, its business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 19085, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BRBS"}
