{"cik": "1061069", "company": "AVALON HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following factors, as well as, factors described elsewhere in the Form 10-K, or in other filings by Avalon with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect Avalon\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results.\nVoting control by management\nAvalon has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote and each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. Except for the election of Avalon\u2019s Board of Directors, the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented for a vote to the shareholders. The holders of the Avalon Class B Common Stock, which consists principally of the management of Avalon, have approximately 66 percent of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding Avalon Common Stock. Currently, the holders of the Avalon Class A Common Stock will not, either alone or acting collectively, be able to elect a majority of the members of Avalon\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cAvalon Board\u201d) or control many corporate actions. However, the holders of the Avalon Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect the number of directors equal to at least 25 percent of the total Board of Directors of Avalon until the outstanding Avalon Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 50 percent of the total voting power of the outstanding Avalon Common Stock, after which time the holders of the Avalon Class A and Class B Common Stock will vote as a single class for the election of directors and all matters presented for a vote to the shareholders. The holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, voting as separate classes, must also approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that adversely affect the shares of their class.\nEach share of Class B Common Stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the shareholder, into one share of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock are also automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on the transfer of such shares to any person other than Avalon, another holder of Class B Common Stock or a Permitted Transferee, as defined in Avalon\u2019s Articles of Incorporation.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations and Ohio Law\nThe Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of Avalon, as well as, Ohio statutory law, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of Avalon not approved by the Avalon Board. Such provisions may also have the effect of discouraging third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition or change of control of Avalon, even though such proposals, if made, might be considered desirable by a majority of the Avalon stockholders. Such provisions could also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of the current management of Avalon without the concurrence of the Avalon Board. These provisions have been designed to enable Avalon to develop its business and foster its long-term growth without disruptions caused by the threat of a takeover not deemed by the Avalon Board to be in the best interest of Avalon and its stockholders.\nDividend policy\nThe dividend policy of Avalon is determined by the Avalon Board. Avalon intends to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business and, therefore, does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAvalon\u2019s market for shares may be subject to greater volatility and limited daily activity\nMarket fluctuations, as well as economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of the Avalon Class A Common Stock. Given the relatively small market capitalization of Avalon, the market for its Class A Common Stock may be subject to greater volatility than would be the case for a large company. In addition, the selling and buying of shares on a daily basis may be limited because of the relatively small capitalization of Avalon.\nFinancial impact of COVID-19 pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially concentrated in China, the outbreak spread to other countries and infections have been reported globally including in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic. As a result, the federal and state governmental bodies began taking unprecedented measures to try and control the spread of the virus including the issuance of temporary stay at home orders, the temporary closing of non-essential businesses and in-house dining and restrictions on gatherings and events.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the various governmental orders that were issued to control the spread of COVID-19 adversely impacted our operations and related financial results. Our restaurants operated under government mandated occupancy restrictions for in-house dining. Food and beverages sales related to banquets and conferences were significantly lower as a result of restrictions placed on gatherings and events. In addition, in March 2020, the Company began experiencing a high level of room and event cancellations with some subsequent re-bookings for a future date. As a result of the government mandates being subsequently lifted, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAlthough the various government mandates impacting our business operations have currently been lifted, we may experience weakened demand in light of travel restrictions or warnings, consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending and general economic uncertainty. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 variants, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Governmental bodies may impose restrictions, which could include additional shutdowns, to stop the spread of infection. These restrictions would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA majority of Avalon\u2019s business is not subject to long-term contracts\nA significant portion of Avalon\u2019s business is generated from waste brokerage and management services provided to customers and is not subject to long-term contracts. In light of current economic, regulatory and competitive conditions, there can be no assurance that Avalon\u2019s current customers will continue to transact business with Avalon at historical levels. Failure by Avalon to retain its current customers or to replace lost business could adversely impact the future financial performance of Avalon.\nAvalon\u2019s captive landfill management business is dependent upon a single customer as its sole source of revenue. If the captive landfill management business is unable to retain this customer, Avalon\u2019s future financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nA significant source of the golf and related operations revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Members are obligated to pay dues for a one year period. As such, the golf and related operations is primarily dependent on the sale and renewal of memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club, on a year to year basis.\nAvalon's loan and security agreement may obligate it to repay debt before its maturity\nThe Company\u2019s loan and security agreement contains certain covenants and events of default. Should Avalon be unable to meet one or more of these covenants, its lender may require it to repay any outstanding balance prior to the expiration date of the agreement. Our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in our loan and security agreement may be affected by worsening economic or business conditions, or other events that may be beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service debt and meet these covenants. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. The Company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to pay off any long-term borrowings under the loan and security agreement, so as to avoid default.\nLong-lived asset impairment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets should be assessed. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. If an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present, Avalon estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the applicable groups of long-lived assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value, Avalon would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the groups of long-lived assets exceeds their fair value. Avalon would determine the fair value by using quoted market prices, if available, for such assets; or if quoted market prices are not available, Avalon would discount the expected estimated future cash flows.\nThe ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value. Avalon\u2019s assessments of cash flows represent management\u2019s best estimate at the time of the impairment review. Avalon estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets. The key variables that management must estimate include, among other factors, sales, costs, inflation and capital spending. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties. If different cash flows had been estimated in the current period, the value of the long-lived assets could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, Avalon\u2019s accounting estimates may change from period to period as conditions in markets change, and this could materially impact financial results in future periods.\nSeasonality\nAvalon\u2019s operations are somewhat seasonal in nature since a significant portion of those operations are primarily conducted in selected northeastern and midwestern states. Additionally, Avalon\u2019s golf courses are located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania and are significantly dependent upon weather conditions during the golf season. As a result, Avalon\u2019s financial performance could be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions.\nSaltwater disposal wells\nSaltwater disposal wells are regulated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\u201cODNR\u201d), with portions of the disposal facilities regulated by the Ohio EPA. As exploitation of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations by the hydrofracturing process develops, regulatory and public awareness of the environmental risks of saltwater brine and its disposal in saltwater disposal wells is growing and consequently, it is expected that regulation governing the construction and operation of saltwater disposal wells will increase in scope and complexity. Increased regulation may result in increased construction and/or operating costs, which could adversely affect the financial results of Avalon.\nThere is a continuing risk during the saltwater disposal well\u2019s operation of an environmental event causing contamination to the water tables in the surrounding area, or seismic events. The occurrence of a spill or contamination at a disposal well site could result in remedial expenses and/or result in the operations at the well site being suspended and/or terminated by the Ohio EPA or the ODNR. Incurring remedial expenses and/or a suspension or termination of Avalon\u2019s right to operate one or more saltwater disposal wells at the well site could have an adverse effect on Avalon\u2019s financial results.\nAs a result of a seismic event with a magnitude of 2.1 occurring on August 31, 2014, the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management (\u201cChief\u201d or \u201cDivision\u201d) issued Orders on September 3, 2014 to immediately suspend all operations of Avalon\u2019s two saltwater injection wells until the Division could further evaluate the wells. The Orders were based on the findings that the two saltwater injection wells were located in close proximity to an area of known seismic activity and that the saltwater injection wells pose a risk of increasing or creating seismic activity.\nOn September 5, 2014, Avalon submitted the information required by the Chief\u2019s Order in regards to its AWMS #1 injection well, and the Chief lifted the suspension for that well on September 18, 2014. On September 19, 2014, Avalon submitted information and a written plan required by the Chief\u2019s Order proposing the establishment of certain operations and management controls on injections for the AWMS #2 injection well. To date, the Division has not responded to that plan despite Avalon\u2019s requests for feedback.\nOn October 2, 2014, Avalon filed an appeal with the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) disputing the basis for suspending operations of AWMS #2 and also the authority of the Chief to immediately suspend such operations. On March 11, 2015, an appeal hearing was held. The Chief stated during the hearing that the suspension order is temporary, and he expects that AWMS #2 will be allowed to resume operations once the state\u2019s final policymaking is complete.\nOn August 12, 2015, the Commission upheld the temporary suspension of injection operations of AWMS #2 stating that the temporary suspension would allow the Chief more time to fully evaluate the facts in anticipation of the Division\u2019s implementation of a comprehensive regulatory plan that will specifically address injection-induced seismicity.\nAvalon appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (the \u201cCourt\u201d), and on November 1, 2016 an appeal hearing was held in that Court. On December 23, 2016, the Court issued its Decision and Order in Avalon\u2019s favor, and vacated the Commission\u2019s decision. The Court found that the Division\u2019s suspension and refusal to work with the Company over the 26 month period was arbitrary and not in accordance with reason. Subsequent to the ruling, and in accordance with the Court\u2019s Decision and Order, both Avalon and the Division submitted their proposed restart plans to the Court. Avalon\u2019s plan sets forth both the initial volumes and pressures and increases in volume and pressure while continuously monitoring seismicity and addressing the concerns of public health and safety.\nOn February 21, 2017, the Court issued its Final Decision and Order. The Court\u2019s Final Decision and Order set forth conditions for restarting the AWMS #2 salt water injection well in accordance with the proposed restart plans filed by Avalon with minor revisions. On February 22, 2017, the Division appealed the Final Decision and Order and filed a Motion to Stay the Court Order. The Motion to Stay was granted by the Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals on March 21, 2017.\nOn September 14, 2017, an appeal hearing was held in the Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals and on July 31, 2018 a decision was issued on the appeal. The decision reinstated the previous Ohio Oil and Gas Commission decision in this matter.\nOn September 12, 2018, the Company appealed the Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On November 21, 2018, the Company received notice from the Supreme Court of Ohio that the court would not accept for review the Company\u2019s appeal of the Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals decision on the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management\u2019s appeal of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas February 21, 2017 entry allowing restart of the Company\u2019s AWMS Water Solutions, LLC #2 salt water injection well.\nOn April 5, 2019, Avalon filed with the Oil and Gas Commission a motion to vacate its prior decisions in this matter. The Oil and Gas Commission scheduled a hearing on this motion for August 13, 2019. Before the hearing began, and in response to the Division\u2019s motion to dismiss the Company\u2019s motion to vacate, the Commission dismissed the matter. The Company appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. In April 2020, the Division\u2019s motion to dismiss and the Company\u2019s opposition were reviewed by the Court. The Company is currently awaiting judgment from the Court.\nConcurrently with the filing of the appeal with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, the Company filed a writ of mandamus in the 10th District Court of Appeals on August 30, 2019 to compel the chief of the Division to issue restart orders, or alternative orders that would allow the Company to either restart the AWMS #2 well, or appeal said orders to the Oil and Gas Commission in accordance with Ohio Law. On October 6, 2020 and in response to a motion from the Division, the Court dismissed this complaint for writ of mandamus.\nIn addition, on August 26, 2016, Avalon filed a complaint in the 11th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio for a Peremptory Writ of Mandamus to compel the Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\u201cODNR\u201d) to initiate appropriations procedures to determine damages from the illegal regulatory taking of the Company\u2019s property, or issue an alternative remedy at law. The Company believes that the actions, and lack of responsible actions, by the ODNR is a clear violation of the Company\u2019s property rights and a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution; and Ohio Revised Code Chapter 163.\nOn March 18, 2019, Avalon received notice that the 11th Appellate District Court in Trumbull County, Ohio issued summary judgment in favor of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in the writ of mandamus action that resulted from the suspension order of the Company\u2019s salt water injection well. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on April 5, 2019. Oral arguments in the case occurred on April 7, 2020. On September 23, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in favor of the Company. The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the decision of the 11th Appellate District Court and remanded the case back to that court for a trial on the merits. The trial occurred in September and October 2021. The Company is currently awaiting judgment from the 11th Appellate District Court.\nOn May 24, 2021, the Company received Chief\u2019s Orders from the Division vacating the September 3, 2014 suspension orders for AWMS #2 and setting conditions for restart of that well. Among these conditions was a limit placed on the seismicity within three miles of the well. Under the Order, if a seismic event with a magnitude 2.1 or above occurs, the well must cease operations for an indefinite period of time until concurrence for subsequent restart is received from the Division. The Company appealed the May 2021 Chief\u2019s Order to the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission, seeking reasonable operating conditions that will allow the facility to operate profitably while protecting human health and property. A hearing in this matter occurred in February 2022. The Company is currently awaiting judgment.\nEnvironmental liabilities\nAvalon may be subject to liability for environmental contamination caused by pollutants, the transportation, treatment or disposal of which was arranged for by Avalon or one of its predecessors.\nAlthough Avalon has compliance guidelines for its waste brokerage and management services business, Avalon could still incur a substantial liability for environmental damage not covered by or in excess of its insurance policy limits and, as such, its financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCompetitive pressures\nThe hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management business is highly competitive and fragmented. Avalon\u2019s waste disposal brokerage and management business competes with other brokerage companies, as well as, with companies which own treatment and disposal facilities. In addition to price, knowledge and service are key factors when competing for waste disposal brokerage and management business. Avalon\u2019s waste disposal brokerage and management business obtains and retains customers by providing services and identifying cost-efficient disposal options unique to a customer\u2019s needs. Consolidation within the solid waste industry has resulted in reducing the number of companies offering disposal options available to waste generators and may cause disposal pricing to increase. Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time.\nGolf memberships and liquor licenses\nThe Avalon Golf and Country Club operates four golf courses and related country clubs and a multipurpose recreation center. The Avalon Golf and Country Club facilities also offer swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, dining and banquet facilities, salon and spa services. In addition, The Grand Resort provides guests with a self-contained vacation experience, offering hotel guests golf packages to all of the golf courses of the Avalon Golf and Country Club and allows its guests to utilize the facilities at each of the clubhouses. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Grand Resort. The Avalon Golf and Country Club competes with many public courses and country clubs in the area. Although the golf courses continue to be available to the general public, the primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Avalon believes that the combination of its golf facilities and The Grand Resort will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Although Avalon was able to increase the number of members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, as of December 31, 2021, the ability to retain current members and attract new members has been an ongoing challenge. Avalon is continually using different marketing strategies to attract new members, such as local television advertising and various membership promotions. A significant decline in members could adversely affect the future financial performance of Avalon.\nAvalon\u2019s golf course operations, The Grand Resort and multipurpose recreation center currently hold liquor licenses for their respective facilities. If, for some reason, any one of these facilities were to lose their liquor license, the financial performance of the golf and related operations would be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulations\nA portion of Avalon\u2019s waste management services revenues is derived from the brokerage of the disposal and/or transportation of out-of-state waste. Any law or regulation restricting or impeding the transportation of waste or the acceptance of out-of-state waste for disposal could have a negative effect on Avalon.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, and 80% of taxable income in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Appropriations Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Appropriations Act, among other things, temporarily extends through December 31, 2025, certain expiring tax provisions, including look-through treatment of payments of dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued from related controlled foreign corporations. Additionally, the Appropriations Act enacts new provisions and extends certain provisions originated within the CARES Act, including an extension of time for repayment of the deferred portion of employees\u2019 payroll tax through December 31, 2021, and a temporary allowance for full deduction of certain business meals. Avalon has elected not to defer the employees\u2019 portion of payroll tax. Management is currently evaluating the other provisions of the Appropriations Act, but at present time does not expect that the other provisions of the Appropriations Act would result in a material tax or cash benefit.\nChanges in laws, regulations and accounting standards\nOur implementation of new accounting rules and interpretations or compliance with changes in existing accounting rules could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods.\nAccounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and subsequent adjustments could have a material adverse effect on operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified.\nCybersecurity risks and security breaches\nOur business involves the storage of members\u2019 information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We are entirely dependent on the secure operation of our systems. While we have incurred no cyber-attacks or security breaches to date, a number of other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our members, or both. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our members, our security measures may not provide absolute security. A cybersecurity breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nInflation\nAvalon has not entered into any long-term fixed price contracts that could have a material adverse impact upon its financial performance in periods of inflation. In general, management believes that rising costs resulting from price inflation could be passed on to customers; however, Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time.", "PERMNO": 86113, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "AWX"}
