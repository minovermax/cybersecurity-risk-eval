Risk Factors.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document, including \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition,\u201d and the documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain both historical and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Company\u2019s current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate\u201d or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Company\u2019s objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. More information about these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth below. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors may be described in the Company\u2019s filings made under the securities laws. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that the Company does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document and the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nRISK FACTORS\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could affect its business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, technological, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nI-16\nThe Company\u2019s success and profitability are dependent upon audience acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict.\nTelevision and other content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of such content, and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that the Company receives. The use of evolving ratings technologies and measurements, and viewership on platforms or devices, such as tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, that is not being fully measured, could have an impact on the Company\u2019s program ratings and advertising revenues. For example, while C-7, a current television industry sales metric, measures live, in-home, commercial viewing plus seven days of digital video recorder (\u201cDVR\u201d) and video-on-demand playback, the viewership occurring on subsequent days of DVR and video-on-demand playback, as well as out-of-home viewing and online and mobile viewership, are excluded from current audience viewership measures. Also, consumer viewership of OTT services continues to grow and is under measured. Low ratings can lead to lower pricing and advertising spending. For example, there can be no assurance that any replacement programming on the Company\u2019s television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability as previous programming. In addition, the success of the Company\u2019s cable networks and Simon & Schuster is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its programming and publications, respectively. Low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content, including its programming and publications, will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, any decreased popularity of programming for which the Company has incurred significant commitments could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Programming and talent commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate approximately $8.98 billion as of December 31, 2018, primarily included $6.62 billion for sports programming rights, $1.71 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and $660 million for talent contracts, with $889 million of these amounts payable in and after 2024. A shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the programming the Company expects to distribute or the sports events for which the Company has acquired rights, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time.\nA decline in advertising expenditures could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and basic cable networks, television stations, syndicated programming, and digital properties. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market, such as Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, in which the Company owns and operates sizeable businesses, could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial and pharmaceutical segments, represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors\u2019 advertising expenditures may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue. Advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising from the Company may also be affected by a decline in audience ratings for the Company\u2019s programming, the inability of the Company to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by new program channels and the proliferation of media formats, including the internet and video-on-demand and the deployment of portable digital video devices and new technologies, which allow consumers to live stream and time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast-forward through advertisements. In addition, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising promptly, from more traditional media, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the Company\nI-17\nas traditional advertising methods. Any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and results of operations.\nThe Company must respond to rapid changes in technology, content creation, services, standards and changes in consumer behavior in order to remain competitive.\nVideo, telecommunications and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly as are the digital publishing and distribution models for books. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage could reduce subscription or advertiser-supported viewership of the Company\u2019s programming and have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, unauthorized digital distribution of video content including via streaming and downloading, simultaneous live streaming of telecast content which allows users to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments and \u201ccloud-based\u201d DVR storage. Further, these and other technologies drive changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the Company\u2019s offerings to advertisers and adversely affect its revenues, including devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-delayed basis and technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content and reduce the demand for electronic sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray Disc products. The Company\u2019s business also may be adversely affected by the use of antennas (and their integration with set-top boxes or other consumer devices) to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions and live and stored video streaming boxes and services, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages.\nMore television and video programming options, including via digital streaming services and platforms, increase competition for viewers. In addition, competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over the Company for advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of the Company\u2019s programming. Also, the impact of technological changes on MVPDs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s cable networks\u2019 ability to grow revenue. In order to respond to these developments, the Company implements changes to its business models and strategies from time to time. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s direct-to-consumer digital streaming business models will continue to successfully respond to changes in technologies and consumer preferences. Anticipating and timely adapting to changes in technology and content consumption and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes could affect the Company\u2019s ability to continue to increase its revenues.\nIncreased programming and content costs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nThe Company produces and acquires programming and other content and incurs costs with respect to its content, including for all types of creative talent, such as actors, authors, writers and producers, composers and publishers of music, as well as for marketing and distribution. The Company plans to increase its investment in content and related marketing and distribution, including for its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. An increase in any of these costs and increased competition from large entertainment companies and additional entrants with substantial resources for the production, acquisition and distribution of new content, including Amazon, Apple, Hulu and Netflix, may lead to decreased profitability. As competition for popular content is intense, the Company may have to increase expenditures for talent and intellectual property rights. In addition, changes in content consumption as well as the increasing number of available digital and other program, entertainment and news services increase the risks associated with the success of all types of content. There can be no assurance that the Company will recoup its investments in programming and related costs. These factors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nI-18\nPiracy of the Company\u2019s programming and other content, including digital piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of the Company\u2019s programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses and profitability.\nPiracy of programming, books and other copyrighted material is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by the availability of digital copies of content, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of the Company\u2019s content. Technological advances, which facilitate the streaming of programming via the internet to television screens and other devices, may increase piracy. The proliferation of unauthorized access to content, including through unauthorized live streaming, streaming boxes and apps programmed to seek pirated copies of content, the unauthorized premature release of content and unauthorized account sharing of subscription program services, has an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and profitability because these unauthorized actions reduce the revenue that the Company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. Increases in piracy would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and profitability. Also, while legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. The Company enforces its rights against entities that illegally secure and exhibit its content, including streaming the Company\u2019s content without obtaining the consent of or paying compensation to the Company. Failure of legal and technological protections to evolve and enable enhanced enforcement efforts to combat piracy could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the Company\u2019s enforcement costs.\nFailure by the Company to obtain, create and retain the rights related to popular programming could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues from its television, cable networks and digital services businesses are partially dependent on the Company\u2019s continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Moreover, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive library of television programming. Generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication, however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened. If the content of its television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the Company\u2019s revenues could be adversely affected. The Company obtains a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. For example, some of CBS Television Network\u2019s most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf\u2019s Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship, NFL games, NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament games and series such as Young Sheldon, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the Company has negotiated with third parties. In addition, Showtime Networks enters into commitments and competes with other buyers to acquire rights to certain programming for Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix from motion picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations. The Company competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce programming. In addition, competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the Company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the Company. The Company\u2019s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses operate in highly competitive and consolidating industries.\nThe Company competes with other media companies for high quality content to achieve large audiences and to generate advertising and subscription revenue. The Company also competes for distribution on various MVPDs and third-party digital platforms. The Company\u2019s ability to attract audiences and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular programming and books and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms. The consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors, content providers, printers and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and intensified competition for audiences, advertising revenue, print production and distribution. In addition, consolidation among book retailers and the growth of online sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space for the Company\u2019s publications and for the attention of consumers online. Competition for audiences and advertising\nI-19\ncomes from: broadcast television stations and networks; cable television systems and networks; motion picture studios; the internet; non-traditional programming services, including increases in the number of direct-to-consumer services; technological innovations in content distribution; terrestrial and satellite radio and portable devices; local, regional and national newspapers; direct mail; and other communications and advertising media that operate in these markets. Other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the Company\u2019s stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. In book publishing, competition among electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. Moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services. This competition could result in lower ratings and advertising and subscription and other revenues or increased content costs and promotional and other expenses and, consequently, lower the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flow. The Company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe loss of affiliation agreements or retransmission agreements or renewals on less favorable terms could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe CBS Television Network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per week. In return, the CBS Television Network\u2019s affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming and pay the Company station affiliation fees. Loss of station affiliation agreements of the CBS Television Network could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations by reducing the reach of the Company\u2019s programming and therefore its attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. The non-renewal or termination of retransmission agreements with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs or continued distribution on less favorable terms could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and its ability to distribute its network programming to a nationwide audience and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell advertising, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks are also dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with MVPDs and third-party digital platforms and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such programmers. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of Showtime Networks\u2019, CBS Sports Network\u2019s and Smithsonian Networks\u2019 program services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. Also, consolidation among MVPDs and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of the lower retail prices of digital streaming services, could adversely affect the terms of the Company\u2019s renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs and digital streaming services continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including \u201cskinny bundles,\u201d which are generally smaller than the traditional program package or may allow the consumer to customize its package of program services. To the extent these packages do not include the Company\u2019s programming and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional program packages, the Company could experience a decline in affiliate and subscription revenues.\nCyber attacks or other events that adversely affect the Company\u2019s information systems or result in the breach of proprietary or confidential information could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, harm its reputation and expose the Company to regulatory enforcement and litigation.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of the Company\u2019s content by the Company or third parties, are important to the Company\u2019s business activities. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures and disaster recovery planning, network\nI-20\nand information systems-related events, such as process breakdowns, employee or partner error, cyber attacks or other activities, and power outages, terrorism, natural or other disasters, could result in a disruption or degradation of the Company\u2019s services and operations, damage to equipment and data, and dissatisfaction or loss of viewers, customers or advertisers. The Company manages, stores, and otherwise processes proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to its operations. The Company may experience breaches or other compromise of the information technology systems it uses for these purposes, as criminal or other actors may be able to penetrate the Company\u2019s network security and misappropriate or compromise the Company\u2019s business information, including intellectual property, financial, personal or other confidential information, or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that the Company produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede the Company\u2019s operations. Breaches of the Company\u2019s security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about the Company or its customers or other third parties could expose such affected parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for the Company, damage the Company\u2019s brands and reputation, or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s business. Further, the Company relies in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on the Company.\nThe Company is subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of user and other personal data. The Company\u2019s ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting its business may require the Company to notify regulators and customers, employees, or other individuals of a data security breach, including in the EU under the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The Company will continue to incur expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations, but despite such efforts may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of a data breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results are subject to seasonal variations and other factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences, on people\u2019s viewing, reading, attendance and listening habits. Typically, the Company\u2019s revenue from advertising increases in the first and fourth quarters, Simon & Schuster generates an increased portion of its revenues in the second half of the year and license fees for television programming are dependent on the commencement of a license period, mix, number and availability of the Company\u2019s television programming, which may cause operating results to increase or decrease during a period and create non-comparable results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. In addition, the Company\u2019s advertising revenues benefit when the Company broadcasts the Super Bowl and NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament National Semifinals and Championship and, in even-numbered years, benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and customers.\nThe U.S. and other countries where the Company operates experience slowdowns and volatilities in their economies from time to time. A downturn could lead to lower consumer and business spending for the Company\u2019s products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers and other consumers of the Company\u2019s content offerings and services, reduce demands for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, in unfavorable economic environments, the Company\u2019s customers may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely payments and continue operations, including distribution of the Company\u2019s\nI-21\ncontent. The Company is unable to predict the duration and severity of weakened economic conditions and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses, operating results, and financial condition.\nVolatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for the Company.\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the Company\u2019s ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of its debt could be adversely affected. Although the Company can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the Company\u2019s short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by credit ratings agencies. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in the Company\u2019s debt ratings, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain cost-effective financing.\nChanges in communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe television broadcasting and distribution industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For example, the Company is required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate its television stations. The Company cannot be assured that the FCC will approve its future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of the Company\u2019s licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues. The Company must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of its television stations and its television networks. FCC regulations prohibit the common ownership of more than one of the top four networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, and limit the number of television stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide, which could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require it to divest some television stations. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of the Company\u2019s television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require television stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the Company\u2019s advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by the Company. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned in whole or in part by cable distribution or telephone company systems) to all cable program services. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the FCC\u2019s actions or their effect, if any, on the Company\u2019s broadcasting properties. In addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations governing the broadcast and distribution of content, competition and the internet, including those affecting data privacy, as well as the new EU law requiring 30% local content on subscription video on demand services and proposed amendments to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s international businesses and internet properties. The Company is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations.\nVigorous enforcement or modification of FCC indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast and cable industries could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with\nI-22\nthe spontaneity of live programming. The FCC enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. The FCC has found on a number of occasions that the content of television broadcasts has contained indecent material. In such instances, the FCC issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent \u201cutterance,\u201d in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. Broadcasting indecent material could result in fines per station of a maximum of approximately $407,000 per utterance and/or the loss of a station\u2019s FCC license. If the FCC denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of the Company\u2019s television stations, the Company would lose its authority to operate the station. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC\u2019s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to the Company\u2019s ability to comply with the rules. Violation of indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations. Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of the Company\u2019s cable content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.\nThe failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities on which the Company depends to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe Company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations. Each of the Company\u2019s television stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. Failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe Company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming.\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. A downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Also, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the Company\u2019s programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of such assets. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported net earnings.\nDividends and dividend rates cannot be guaranteed.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors assesses relevant factors when considering the declaration of a dividend on the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to declare dividends, including at the same or similar rates.\nThe loss of key personnel, including talent, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of the Company\u2019s corporate and divisional executive officers and various creative talent and entertainment personalities. The Company believes that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the impairment of the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy. The Company employs or contracts with highly regarded\nI-23\ndirectors, actors, producers, authors and other talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences and achieving the success of the Company\u2019s programming, television stations, books and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with or be drawn to the Company or will retain their current appeal. If the Company fails to retain or attract entertainment personalities, authors and talent or they lose their current appeal, the Company\u2019s revenues could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact its financial condition.\nThe Company has both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. The Company cannot be assured that its reserves are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, operating performance or cash flow.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by strikes and other union activity.\nThe Company, its suppliers and business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees, players in sports leagues and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company, its suppliers or business partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect the Company\u2019s television, cable networks and interactive businesses by disrupting the Company\u2019s ability to provide scheduled services and programming or by causing delays in the production of the Company\u2019s programming. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or their timing.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates and political and economic risks associated with the Company\u2019s international businesses could harm the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses operate and have customers worldwide. Certain of the Company\u2019s revenues are earned and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Other inherent risks of doing business in international markets include changes in the economic environment, potentially adverse tax developments, export restrictions, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade and sanctions barriers, longer payment cycles, and changes in privacy and data protection laws. The Company may incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic environment in the regions where it does business. For example, the ongoing \u201cBrexit\u201d processes to withdraw the U.K. from the EU, which is expected to occur in 2019, may adversely affect economic and market conditions in the U.K. and other regions where the Company conducts business and could contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets. In addition, acts of terrorism or other hostilities, or other future financial, political, economic or other uncertainties, could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies may result in material tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies in the territories where the Company\u2019s businesses operate may result in material tax liabilities. The Company\u2019s tax returns are routinely audited by tax authorities and tax-related litigation or settlements may occur resulting in the assessment of additional taxes. The enactment of the federal tax legislation in December 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) may expose the Company to tax\nI-24\nrisks as a result of the ongoing issuance of interpretive guidance by the U.S. government as to how provisions of the Tax Reform Act are to be applied, which may differ from the Company\u2019s current interpretations. The aforementioned risks may adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate or cash tax payments, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNAI, through its voting control of the Company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval.\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company\u2019s voting Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. At February 13, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.8% of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.5% of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone is the beneficial owner of the controlling interest in NAI and, accordingly, beneficially owns all such shares. Mr. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Chairman Emeritus of the Company's Board of Directors, and Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. NAI is controlled by Mr. Redstone through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the \u201cSMR Trust\u201d), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI, and such voting interest of NAI held by the SMR Trust is voted solely by Mr. Redstone until his incapacity or death. The SMR Trust provides that in the event of Mr. Redstone\u2019s death or incapacity, voting control of the NAI voting interest held by the SMR Trust will pass to seven trustees, who will include CBS Corporation director Ms. Shari Redstone. No member of the Company\u2019s management is a trustee of the SMR Trust.\nSubject to the terms of the settlement and release agreement entered into by the Company and NAI, among others, on September 9, 2018, NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending the Company\u2019s bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that:\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for the stockholders of the Company to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any bylaws of the Company;\n\u2022\nany or all of the directors of the Company may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of the director\u2019s term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of stock of the Company then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose; and\n\u2022\nin accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, stockholders of the Company may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, other stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control.\nSales of NAI\u2019s shares of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the stock price.\nAt February 13, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.8% of the Company\u2019s voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.5% of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Based on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders shares of the Company\u2019s non-voting Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI. The aggregate number of shares\nI-25\nof non-voting Class B Common Stock pledged by NAI to its lenders represents approximately 4.8% of the Company\u2019s total Class B Common Stock outstanding. If there is a default on NAI\u2019s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the collateral, such Class B Common Stock could be sold, which sale could adversely affect the Company\u2019s share price. There can be no assurance that NAI or its subsidiaries at some future time will not sell or pledge additional shares of the Company\u2019s stock, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s share price.\nMany factors may cause the stock price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to fluctuate.\nThe stock price of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors. These factors, some or all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, include: actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; changes in expectations as to the Company\u2019s future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts; success of the Company\u2019s operating and growth strategies; investor anticipation of strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events; operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors. In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of the Company\u2019s actual operating performance.\nThe businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. will be attributable to the other company for certain regulatory purposes, which may limit business opportunities.\nSo long as the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control, each company\u2019s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, will be attributable to the other company for purposes of certain rules and regulations of the FCC, U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust rules and regulations and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the U.S., among others potentially. The businesses of one company will continue to be attributable to the other company for certain FCC and other purposes even after the two companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the two companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of Viacom Inc. may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company, including limitations to which the Company contractually agreed in connection with the Company\u2019s separation of former Viacom Inc. (\u201cFormer Viacom\u201d) into two publicly traded entities, CBS Corporation and new Viacom Inc., which was completed on December 31, 2005 (the \u201cSeparation\u201d).\nIn connection with the Separation, each company will rely on the other company\u2019s performance under various agreements between the companies.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company and Viacom Inc. entered into various agreements, including a Separation Agreement dated December 19, 2005, a Tax Matters Agreement dated December 30, 2005, which are filed as exhibits to this report, and certain related party arrangements pursuant to which the Company and Viacom Inc. will provide services and products to each other from and after the Separation. The Separation Agreement sets forth the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the Company and Viacom Inc. following the Separation, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations are assumed by, each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Each company will rely on the other to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by the Company or Viacom Inc. under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. If Viacom Inc. were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the Company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.\nI-26\nNAI and any common director may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.\nNAI has voting control of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder through the SMR Trust, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Chairman Emeritus of the Company and Chairman Emeritus of Viacom Inc. Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. This ownership overlap and this common director could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the Company\u2019s and Viacom Inc.\u2019s directors and controlling stockholder face decisions that could have different implications for the Company and Viacom Inc. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between the Company and Viacom Inc. regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship between the Company and Viacom Inc. thereafter. These agreements include the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. On occasion, the Company and Viacom Inc. may compete with each other in various commercial enterprises. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if the Company and Viacom Inc. enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future. CBS Corp.\u2019s certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both the Company and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of the Company who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of Viacom Inc. acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both the Company and Viacom Inc., such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to the Company or Viacom Inc. or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, CBS Corp.\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that the Company renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to Viacom Inc. Furthermore, CBS Corp.\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that neither the Company nor Viacom Inc. has any duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the other corporation, doing business with any potential or actual customer or supplier of the other corporation, or employing or soliciting for employment any officer or employee of the other corporation, and that no officer or director of either corporation shall be liable to the other corporation or the other corporation\u2019s stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any such activities of the Company or Viacom Inc., as the case may be. These provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity of one of such companies may be used for the benefit of the other company. If any such opportunity is directed to Viacom Inc., rather than the Company, the Company may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76226, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "VIAC"}
