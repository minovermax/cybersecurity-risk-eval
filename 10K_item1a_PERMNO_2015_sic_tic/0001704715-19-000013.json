{"cik": "1704715", "company": "Contura Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestment in our common stock is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position, or future financial performance or cash flows, which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisk Relating to the Alpha Merger\nWe may not realize the expected business or financial benefits of the Alpha Merger. Integration of the companies could prove difficult, which could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\nWe may not realize the expected business or financial benefit from the integration of the Contura and Alpha operations. These potential difficulties could cause the results of the Alpha Merger to differ from our expectations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business or to achieve anticipated production, revenue or profitability targets;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of attention and resources of management;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset Merger or investment costs;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the merged businesses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a Merger.\nDifficulties like these could disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry and the Global Economy\nDeclines in coal prices would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows, financial condition, stock price and the value of our coal reserves.\nOur results of operations are substantially dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal. Those prices depend upon factors beyond our control (some of which are described in more detail in other risk factors below), including:\n\u2022\nthe demand for domestic and foreign coal and coke, which depends significantly on the demand for electricity and steel;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of natural gas, other alternative fuels and alternative steel production technologies;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic downturns and the strength of the global and U.S. economies;\n\u2022\nthe consumption pattern of industrial customers, electricity generators and residential users;\n\u2022\nthe legal, regulatory and tax environment for our industry and those of our customers;\n\u2022\nadverse weather, climactic or other natural conditions, including natural disasters;\n\u2022\nthe quantity, quality and pricing of coal available in the resale market;\n\u2022\nthe effects of worldwide energy conservation or emissions measures;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other suppliers of coal and other energy sources; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity to and availability, reliability and cost of transportation and port facilities.\nDeclines in coal prices in the U.S. and other countries may materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, as well as the value of our coal reserves and may cause the number of risks that we face to increase in likelihood, magnitude and duration.\nLower demand for metallurgical coal (or \u201cmet coal\u201d) by U.S. and foreign steel producers, including negative effects resulting from the imposition of tariffs, could reduce the price of our met coal, which would reduce our revenues.\nContura produces met coal that is sold directly to both U.S. and foreign steel industry customers and indirectly to foreign steel industry customers through U.S.-based companies. Met coal accounted for approximately 83.2% of our coal revenues (excluding freight and handling revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Any deterioration in conditions in the U.S. or foreign steel industries, including the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the industry, could reduce the demand for our met coal and could impact the collectability of our accounts receivable from U.S. or foreign steel industry customers.\nThe demand for foreign-produced steel both in foreign markets and in the U.S. market also depends on factors such as tariff rates on steel. On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed proclamations imposing a 25 percent tariff on imports of steel mill products and a 10 percent tariff on imports of wrought and unwrought aluminum. Contura\u2019s export customers include foreign steel producers who may be affected by the tariffs to the extent their production is imported into the U.S. Conversely, demand for met coal from our domestic customers may increase. Retaliatory tariffs by foreign nations have already limited international trade and may adversely impact global economic conditions.\nIn addition, the steel industry\u2019s demand for met coal is affected by a number of factors, including the variable nature of that industry\u2019s business, technological developments in the steel-making process and the availability of substitutes for steel, such as aluminum, composites and plastics. The U.S. steel industry increasingly relies on processes to make steel that do not use coke, such as electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes. If this trend continues, the amount of met coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. Lower demand for met coal in international markets could reduce the amount of met coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. Foreign government policies related to coal production and consumption could negatively impact pricing and demand for our products.\nLower demand for thermal coal by North American electric power generators could reduce the price of our thermal coal, which would reduce our revenues.\nThermal coal accounted for approximately 16.8% of our coal revenues (excluding freight and handling revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The majority of our sales of thermal coal were to U.S. electric power generators. The North American demand for thermal coal is affected primarily by:\n\u2022\nthe overall demand for electricity, which is in turn influenced by the global economy and the weather, among other factors (for example, mild North American winters typically result in lower demand);\n\u2022\nthe availability, quality and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, which may change over time as a result of, among other things, technological developments and state or federal regulatory or statutory fuel subsidies or energy use mandates;\n\u2022\nincreasingly stringent environmental and other governmental regulations, including air emission standards for coal-fired power plants; and\n\u2022\nthe coal inventories of utilities.\nMany North American electric power generators have shifted from coal to natural gas-fired power plants. Despite ongoing advancements in the availability and deployment of advanced coal and emissions reduction technologies, we expect that new power plants in the near-term will be fired by natural gas because natural gas-fired plants are less expensive to construct than coal-fired plants and natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel, with plentiful supplies and low cost at the current time. Increasingly stringent regulations have also reduced the number of new power plants being built, particularly coal-fired power plants. A reduction in the amount of coal consumed by North American electric power generators would reduce the amount of thermal coal that we sell and the price that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. In addition, uncertainty caused by federal and state regulations could cause thermal coal customers to be uncertain of their coal requirements in future years, which could adversely affect our ability to sell coal to such customers under multi-year sales contracts.\nCompetition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal, and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices.\nWe compete with numerous other coal producers in various regions of the U.S. for domestic and international sales. We also compete in international markets against coal producers in other countries. International demand for U.S. coal exports also affects coal demand in the U.S. This competition affects domestic and foreign coal prices and our ability to retain or attract coal\ncustomers. Increased competition from the Illinois basin, the threat of increased production from competing mines, and natural gas price declines with large basis differentials have all historically contributed to soft market conditions.\nIn the past, high demand for coal and attractive pricing brought new investors to the coal industry, leading to the development of new mines and added production capacity. Subsequent overcapacity in the industry contributed, and may in the future contribute, to lower coal prices.\nPotential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions, foreign currency fluctuations or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. Additionally, North American steel producers face competition from foreign steel producers, which could adversely impact the financial condition and business of our customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. Coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors\u2019 currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers\u2019 local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d Similarly, currency fluctuations could adversely affect demand for U.S. steel.\nLower demand for U.S. coal exports would reduce our foreign sales, could negatively impact our revenues and could result in downward pressure on domestic coal prices.\nCoal export revenues accounted for approximately 79.3% of our total coal revenues (excluding freight and handling revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to the factors described above, demand for and viability of U.S. coal exports is dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control, including ocean freight rates and port and shipping capacity.\nIn addition, trade conflicts between the United States and other nations that result in the imposition of barriers to trade, such as import tariffs, could materially and adversely affect the international demand and pricing for our coal. The current presidential administration has taken actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S., that have resulted in other nations adopting retaliatory measures such as the imposition of tariffs upon goods imported from the U.S. into those nations. China and Turkey, for example, have imposed tariffs upon the importing of coal from the U.S. The imposition of these trade barriers by other nations has already resulted in adverse effects upon our international sales of coal, including reduced demand and prices. If these barriers endure, or are enhanced, our coal exports may further decline, and increased domestic supply could cause competition among coal producers in the U.S. to intensify, potentially resulting in additional downward pressure on domestic coal prices and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition with natural gas and renewable energy sources, and factors affecting these industries could have an adverse impact on coal demand.\nOur coal competes with natural gas and renewable energy sources, and the price of these sources can therefore affect coal sales. The natural gas market has been volatile historically and prices in this market are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Changes in supply and demand could be prompted by any number of factors, such as worldwide and regional economic and political conditions; the level of global exploration, production and inventories; natural gas prices; and transportation availability. If natural gas prices decline significantly, it could lead to reduced coal sales and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources also have an impact on the market for our coal. Several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. There have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform, national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nFuture governmental policy changes in China may be detrimental to the global coal market and impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Chinese government has from time to time implemented regulations and promulgated new laws or restrictions on their domestic coal industry, sometimes with little advance notice, which may impact worldwide coal demand, supply and prices. The recent rise from historic lows in prices was driven in part by government policies in China that curbed domestic supply. During the past several years, the Chinese government has initiated a number of anti-smog measures aimed at reducing hazardous air emissions through temporary production capacity restrictions within the steel, coal and coal-fired power sectors. It is possible that policy changes from Beijing may be detrimental to the global coal market and, thus, impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, similar actions by government entities in countries that produce and/or consume large quantities of coal and other energy related commodities, such as India, may have a material impact on the prices at which we sell our product.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2018 accounted for approximately 16.7% of our total coal revenues, and coal sales to our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 60.1% of our total coal revenues. These customers may not continue to purchase coal from us as they have previously, or at all. If these customers were to reduce their purchases of coal significantly or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us, our revenues and profitability could suffer.\nWe may not be able to extend our existing long-term supply contracts or enter into new ones, and our existing supply contracts may contain certain provisions that may reduce protection from short-term coal price volatility, which could adversely affect the profitability of our operations.\nA substantial portion of our thermal coal is sold under long-term contracts. When our current contracts with customers expire or are otherwise renegotiated, our customers may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on terms, including pricing terms, that are not as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements.\nFurther, in large part as a result of increasing and frequently changing regulation, and natural gas pricing, electric power generators are increasingly less willing to enter into long-term coal supply contracts, instead purchasing higher percentages of coal under short-term supply contracts. This industry shift away from long-term supply contracts could adversely affect us and the level of our revenues. For example, our having fewer customers with a contractual obligation to purchase coal from us increases the risk that we will not have a consistent market for our production and may require us to sell more coal in the spot market, where prices may be lower than we would expect a customer to pay for a contractually committed supply. Spot market prices also tend to be more volatile than contractual prices, which could result in decreased revenues. Our met coal supply contracts are typically priced on an annual, quarterly or spot basis, and therefore our met coal sales are particularly sensitive to repricing risk.\nGenerally, our long-term thermal coal agreements contain committed volumes and fixed prices for a certain number of periods during which thermal coal will be delivered. However, some of our long-term thermal coal agreements do not provide for a fixed price through the life of the agreement. Those agreements contain price negotiation and similar provisions for upcoming unpriced contract periods, with negotiations generally considering either then current market prices and/or relevant market indices. Failure of the parties to agree on a price can lead to termination of the contract or litigation, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Further, during periods of economic weakness, some of our customers experience lower demand for their products and services and may be unwilling to take all of their contracted tonnage or may request a lower price. Customers may make similar requests when market prices drop significantly. Any adjustment or negotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price could result in decreased revenues. Accordingly, supply contracts with terms of one year or more may provide only limited protection during adverse or volatile market conditions.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness and financial health deteriorate.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness and financial health of our customers. Competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk we bear on payment default. In recent years, downturns in the economy and disruptions in the global financial markets have, from time to time, affected the creditworthiness of our customers and limited their liquidity and credit availability. In addition, our customer base may change with deregulation as utilities sell or transfer their power plants to their\nnon-regulated affiliates or third parties that may be less creditworthy, thereby increasing the risk we bear for customer payment default. These new power plant owners or operators may have credit ratings that are below investment grade or may become below investment grade after we enter into contracts with them.\nCustomers in other countries may be subject to other pressures and uncertainties that may affect their ability to pay, including trade barriers, exchange controls and local economic and political conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2018 we derived 79.3% of our total coal revenues, excluding freight and handling revenues, from coal sales made to customers outside the U.S.\nEconomic downturns and disruptions in the global financial markets have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal, which could have a material negative effect on our sales, costs, margins and profitability and ability to obtain financing.\nEconomic downturns and disruptions in the global financial markets have from time to time resulted in, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, including real estate. These sorts of disruptions, and in particular the tightening of credit in financial markets, could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing for operations and result in a decrease in demand, lower coal prices, the cancellation of some orders for our coal and the restructuring of agreements with some of our customers. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly where imported products are required for the mining process, could result in materially increased operating expenses. Any prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal, on our sales, margins and profitability, and on our own ability to obtain financing. We are unable to predict the timing, duration and severity of any potential future disruptions in financial markets and potential future adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries and the impact these events may have on our operations and the industry in general.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Developments\nThe extensive regulation of the mining industry imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations or violations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal.\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety, transportation, labor and other laws and regulations relating to matters such as:\n\u2022\nblasting;\n\u2022\ncontrols on emissions and discharges;\n\u2022\nthe effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability;\n\u2022\nthe storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022\nthe remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater;\n\u2022\nsurface subsidence from underground mining;\n\u2022\nthe classification of plant and animal species near our mines as endangered or threatened species;\n\u2022\nthe reclamation of mined sites; and\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety, and benefits for current and former employees (described in more detail below).\nThese laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. For example:\n\u2022\nfederal and state agencies and citizen groups have increasingly focused on the amount of selenium and other constituents in mine-related water discharges;\n\u2022\nMSHA and the states of Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia have implemented and proposed changes to mine safety and health requirements to impose more stringent health and safety controls, enhance mine inspection and enforcement practices, increase sanctions, and expand monitoring and reporting; and\n\u2022\nGHG emissions is being considered that could increase our costs, require additional controls, or compel us to limit our current operations.\nIn addition, these laws and regulations require us to obtain numerous governmental permits and comply with the requirements of those permits (described in more detail below).\nWe incur substantial costs to comply with the laws, regulations and permits that apply to our mining and other operations, and to address the outcome of inspections. The required compliance and actions to address inspection outcomes are often time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. In addition, due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations of laws, regulations and permits occur at our operations from time to\ntime and may result in significant costs to us to correct the violations, as well as substantial civil or criminal penalties and limitations or shutdowns of our operations. We are also required to comply with the November 2014 Consent Decree with EPA and several government agencies. See \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters-Clean Water Act-Wastewater Discharge.\u201d\nMSHA and state regulators may also order the temporary or permanent closing of a mine in the event of certain violations of safety rules, accidents or imminent dangers. In addition, regulators may order changes to mine plans or operations due to their interpretation or application of existing or new laws or regulations. Any required changes to mine plans or operations may result in temporary idling of production or addition of costs.\nThese factors have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our costs of production and competitive position, and as a result on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. New laws and regulations, as well as future interpretations or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may have a similar or more significant impact on us, including delays, interruptions or a termination of operations.\nClimate change or carbon dioxide emissions reduction initiatives could significantly reduce the demand for coal and reduce the value of our coal assets.\nGlobal climate issues continue to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, and in particular the emissions of GHG, such as carbon dioxide and methane, on global climate issues. Combustion of fossil fuels like coal results in the creation of carbon dioxide, which is emitted into the atmosphere by coal end users such as coal-fired electric power generators, coke plants and steelmaking plants, and, to a lesser extent, by the combustion of fossil fuels by the mining equipment we use. In addition, coal mining can release methane from the mine, directly into the atmosphere. Concerns associated with global climate change, and GHG emissions reduction initiatives designed to address them, have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in decreased coal-fired power plant capacity and utilization, phasing out and closing many existing coal-fired power plants, reducing or eliminating construction of new coal-fired power plants in the United States and certain other countries, increased costs to mine coal, and decreased demand and prices for coal.\nEmissions from coal consumption and production are subject to pending and proposed regulations as part of regulatory initiatives to address global climate change and global warming. Various international, federal, regional, foreign and state proposals are currently in place or being considered to limit emissions of GHGs, including possible future U.S. treaty commitments, new federal or state legislation, and regulation under existing environmental laws by the EPA and other regulatory agencies and litigation by private parties. These include:\n\u2022\nthe 2015 Paris climate summit agreement, which resulted in voluntary commitments by 197 countries (although on June 1, 2017, the Trump administration announced that the U.S. will withdraw from the agreement) to reduce their GHG emissions and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations and states with respect to future GHG emissions;\n\u2022\nfederal regulations such as the CPP, which is currently stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the ACE Rule, which has been proposed to replace the CPP, that require reductions in emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, and new source performance standards for GHG emissions for new, modified or reconstructed fossil fuel-fired power plants (Power Plant NSPS), which require the use of partial carbon capture and sequestration for fossil fuel-fired steam generating units (although a proposed revision to the Power Plant NSPS would revise this requirement, as discussed below), or any regulation that replaces them;\n\u2022\nstate and regional climate change initiatives implementing renewable portfolio standards or cap-and-trade schemes;\n\u2022\nchallenges to or denials of permits for new coal-fired power plants or retrofits to existing plants by state regulators and environmental organizations due to concerns related to GHG emissions from the new or existing plants; and\n\u2022\nprivate litigation against coal companies or power plant operators based on GHG-related concerns.\nOn March 28, 2017, President Trump signed the Executive Order for Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (\u201cMarch 2017 Executive Order\u201d) that directed the EPA to review and, if appropriate, suspend, revise or rescind, both the CPP and the Power Plant NSPS as necessary to ensure consistency with the goals of energy independence, economic growth and cost-effective environmental regulation. On April 4, 2017, the EPA announced in the Federal Register that it is initiating its review of the CPP and the Power Plant NSPS. On April 28, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the \u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d) paused legal challenges to both the CPP and the Power Plant NSPS for 60 days to allow parties in each of those cases to brief the court on whether the case should be remanded to the agency or kept on hold and in a series of orders since, has continued to hold the cases in abeyance while the EPA rulemaking regarding the CPP and the Power Plant NSPS continues. In December 2018, EPA proposed to revise the Power Plant NSPS to replace its\ndesignation of partial carbon capture and storage as the best system of emission reduction with less stringent standards focusing on improvements in efficiency and operating practices.\nIn October 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to rescind the CPP, and on August 31, 2018, the EPA published the ACE Rule, a proposed replacement of the CPP. The ACE Rule would focus on reducing GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants by requiring states to mandate the implementation of a range of technologies at power plants designed to improve their heat rate (i.e., decrease the amount of fuel necessary to generate the same amount of electricity). The ACE Rule was subject to a 60-day comment period, which ended on October 31, 2018. The outcome of these rulemakings is uncertain and likely to be subject to extensive notice, comment and litigation. More stringent standards for carbon dioxide pollution as a result of these rulemakings could further reduce demand for coal, and our business would be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, certain banks and other financing sources have taken actions to limit available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants, which also may adversely impact the future global demand for coal. Further, there have been recent efforts by members of the general financial and investment communities, such as investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, such as coal producers. Those entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing available to such companies. These efforts may adversely affect the market for our securities and our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future.\nFurthermore, several well-funded non-governmental organizations have explicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. These efforts, as well as concerted conservation and efficiency efforts that result in reduced electricity consumption, and consumer and corporate preferences for non-coal fuel sources, could cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline and could cause our costs to increase.\nAny future laws, regulations or other policies or initiatives of the nature described above may adversely impact our business in material ways. The degree to which any particular law, regulation or policy impacts us will depend on several factors, including the substantive terms involved, the relevant time periods for enactment and any related transition periods. Considerable uncertainty is associated with these regulatory initiatives and legal developments, as the content of proposed legislation and regulation is not yet fully determined, many of the new regulatory initiatives remain subject to governmental and judicial review, and, with respect to federal initiatives, the current U.S. presidential administration and/or Congress may further impact their development. We routinely attempt to evaluate the potential impact on us of any proposed laws, regulations or policies, which requires that we make several material assumptions. From time to time, we determine that the impact of one or more such laws, regulations or policies, if adopted and ultimately implemented as proposed, may result in materially adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow; however, we often are not able to reasonably quantify such impacts.\nIn general, any laws, regulations or other policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions have imposed and are likely to continue to impose significant costs on many coal-fired power plants, steel-making plants and industrial boilers, which may make them unprofitable. Accordingly, some existing power generators have switched to other fuels that generate fewer emissions and others are likely to switch, some power plants have closed and others are likely to close, and fewer new coal-fired plants are being constructed, all of which reduce demand for coal and the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nOther extensive environmental laws, including existing and potential future legislation, treaties and regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, waste management and water discharges, affect our customers and could further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.\nOur customers\u2019 operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental matters, including air emissions, wastewater discharges and the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes; and operational permits. In particular, the Clean Air Act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from fossil-fuel fired power plants, which are the largest end-users of our thermal coal. A series of more stringent requirements will or may become effective in coming years, including:\n\u2022\nimplementation of the current and more stringent proposed ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and ozone, including the EPA\u2019s issuance of NAAQS in October 2015 of a more stringent ambient air quality standard for ozone and the EPA\u2019s determinations of attainment designations with respect to these rules;\n\u2022\nimplementation of the EPA\u2019s CSAPR to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in 28 states, and the CSAPR Update Rule, issued in September 2016, requiring further reductions in nitrogen oxides in 2017 in 22 states subject to CSAPR during the summertime ozone season;\n\u2022\ncontinued implementation of the EPA\u2019s MATS, which impose stringent limits on emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from electric power generators, issued in December 2011 and in effect pending completion of judicial review proceedings and subject to a new draft rule proposed in December 2018 that reverses certain findings that served as the basis for MATS;\n\u2022\nimplementation of the EPA\u2019s August 2014 final rule on cooling water intake structures for power plants;\n\u2022\nmore stringent EPA requirements governing management and disposal of coal ash pursuant to a rule finalized in December 2014 and new amendments effective as of August 2018; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of the EPA\u2019s November 2015 final rule setting effluent discharge limits on the levels of metals that can be discharged from power plants.\nThese environmental laws and regulations impose significant costs on our customers, which are increasing as these requirements become more stringent. These costs make coal more expensive to use and make it a less attractive fuel source of energy for our customers. Accordingly, some existing power generators have switched to other fuels that generate fewer emissions and others are likely to switch, some power plants have closed and others are likely to close, and fewer coal-fired plants are being constructed, all of which reduce demand for coal, the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nIn addition, regulations regarding sulfur dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act, including caps on emissions and the price of emissions allowances, have a potentially significant impact on the demand for our coal based on its sulfur content. We sell both higher sulfur and low sulfur coal. More widespread installation by power generators of technology that reduces sulfur emissions may make high sulfur coal more competitive with our low sulfur coal. Decreases in the price of emissions allowances could have a similar effect. Significant increases in the price of emissions allowances could reduce the competitiveness of higher sulfur coal compared to low sulfur coal and possibly natural gas at power plants not equipped to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Any of these consequences could result in a decrease in revenues from some of our operations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur long-term growth, and particularly that of our thermal coal platform, may be materially adversely impacted if economic, commercially available carbon mitigation technologies are not developed and adopted in a timely manner.\nFederal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of GHGs, including, but not limited to, CO2 from electric generating units using fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas. In order to comply with such regulations, electric generating units using fossil fuels may be required to implement certain emissions control technologies. For example, pursuant to the Power Plant NSPS finalized by the EPA in August 2015, the EPA designated partial carbon capture and sequestration as the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units at power plants to employ to meet the standard. However, there is a risk that such technology, which may include storage, conversion, or other commercial use for captured carbon, may not be commercially practical in limiting emissions as otherwise required by the rule or similar rules that may be proposed in the future. Although in December 2018, EPA proposed to revise the Power Plant NSPS to replace its designation of carbon capture and storage as the best system of emissions reduction with less stringent standards, this proposal may be subject to change and administrative and legal challenges. If such legislative or regulatory programs are adopted or remain in place, and economic, commercially available carbon capture or other carbon mitigation technologies for power plants are not developed or adopted in a timely manner, it would negatively affect our customers and would further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source, causing coal prices and sales of our coal to decline, perhaps materially.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service could withhold tax refunds and refundable credits and assert a right to setoff against pre-petition claims of the U.S. government during the Alpha Bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded approximately $68.8 million of federal income tax receivable and approximately $68.8 million of federal deferred tax asset related to refundable Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits. In addition, the Company has recorded a non-current federal income tax receivable of approximately $43.8 million related to a net operating loss (NOL) carryback claim. Because the U.S. government was a creditor in the Predecessor Alpha bankruptcy proceedings, it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could withhold some or all of the tax refund attributable to the NOL carryback claim and the AMT refundable credits and assert a right to set off the tax refund and refundable credits against the U.S. government\u2019s pre-petition bankruptcy claims. If the IRS were to take such actions, the Company would vigorously defend its position. However, if the Company were unsuccessful, there could be a material, adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s assets.\nDecreases in consumer demand for electricity and changes in general energy consumption patterns attributable to energy conservation trends could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to efforts to promote energy conservation in recent years, there is a risk that both the demand for electricity and the general energy consumption patterns of consumers worldwide will decrease. The ability of energy conservation technologies, public initiatives and government incentives to reduce electricity consumption or to support other forms of renewable energy could also lead to a reduction in the price of coal. If prices for coal are not competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations use certain hazardous materials, and from time to time we generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes. We may be subject to claims under federal or state law for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, sediments, groundwater and other natural resources. Such claims may arise out of current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, and at contaminated sites owned or operated by third parties to which we sent wastes for treatment, storage or disposal. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.\nWe operate and maintain a number of coal slurry impoundments. These impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Some slurry impoundments maintained by other coal mining operations have failed, causing extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages. Some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of resulting damages. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties, and potential third-party claims for personal injury, property damage or other losses. In addition, we may become subject to such claims related to surface expressions of methane gas, which can result from underground coal mining activities.\nThese and other environmental impacts that our operations may have, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could render continued operations at certain mines economically unfeasible or impractical or otherwise materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain and renew permits, mine plan modifications and approvals, leases or other rights necessary for our operations, which would reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nMining companies must obtain numerous regulatory permits that impose strict conditions on various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining. The permitting rules are complex and change over time, potentially in ways that may make our ability to comply with the applicable requirements more difficult or impractical or even preclude the continuation of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations. The public, including special interest groups and individuals, have certain rights under various statutes to comment upon, submit objections to and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits or administrative actions to challenge permits or mining activities. In states where we operate, applicable laws and regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can, under certain circumstances, be delayed, refused or revoked if we or any entity that owns or controls or is under common ownership or control with us or is determined to be linked to us under OSM\u2019s AVS, have unabated permit violations or have been the subject of permit or reclamation bond revocation or suspension. These regulations define certain relationships, such as owning over 50% of stock in an entity or having the authority to determine the manner in which the entity conducts mining operations, as constituting ownership and control. Certain other relationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including being an officer or director of an entity or owning between 10% and 50% of the mining operator. This presumption, in some cases, can be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted. Thus, past or ongoing violations of federal and state mining laws by us or by coal mining operations owned or controlled by our significant stockholders, directors or officers or by entities linked to us through OSM\u2019s AVS could provide a basis to revoke existing permits and to deny the issuance of additional permits or modification or amendment of existing permits. This is known as being \u201cpermit-blocked.\u201d In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups.\nAs a result, the permitting process is costly and time-consuming, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion (or at all), and permits that are issued may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to conduct our\nmining activities efficiently. In some circumstances, regulators could seek to revoke permits previously issued. We are required under certain permits to provide data on the impact on the environment of proposed exploration for or production of coal to governmental authorities.\nIn particular, certain of our activities require a dredge and fill permit from the COE under Section 404 of the CWA. In recent years, the Section 404 permitting process has been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and a series of court challenges, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the permitting process.\nIn addition, in 2015, the EPA and the COE issued a final rule, now known as the CWR under the CWA that would further expand the circumstances when a Section 404 permit is needed. The CWR is the subject of extensive ongoing litigation and administrative proceedings and its current and future impact on our operations are the subject of significant uncertainty. The rule was subsequently stayed nationwide by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit during the pendency of several lawsuits challenging the CWR in the Sixth Circuit and several federal district courts. On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, ruling that jurisdiction over challenges to the CWR rests with the federal district courts and not with the appellate courts, which was followed by the dissolution of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. On February 6, 2018, the EPA and COE published a rule that delayed applicability of the CWR for two years. However, on August 16, 2018, the federal court in South Carolina enjoined the rule, effectively reinstating the CWR in Virginia and Pennsylvania (where we have operations) and in 24 other states. The injunction is being challenged on appeal. However, our West Virginia operations remain unaffected by the CWR, due to separate injunctions issued by federal courts in Georgia and North Dakota applicable to West Virginia and 23 other states. On February 28, 2017, while challenges to the CWR were pending, President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA and the COE to review the CWR for consistency with the goals of \u201cpromoting economic growth and minimizing regulatory uncertainty\u201d and to consider a new rule that reflects Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion in the 2006 Supreme Court decision, Rapanos v. United States, that CWA jurisdiction attaches only to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d and other waters with a relatively permanent flow, such as rivers or lakes. On March 6, 2017, the EPA and the COE published a Notice of Intent to review and rescind or revise the rule and on June 29, 2018 the EPA and the COE published a supplemental notice indicating their intention to repeal the CWR and providing a variety of reasons to support such a repeal. On December 11, 2018, EPA and USACE issued a pre-publication version and supporting documents for a proposed rule replacing the CWR (the proposal was formally published on February 14, 2019). In accordance with President Trump\u2019s executive order, the proposed rule would define \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d along the lines of Justice Scalia\u2019s Rapanos opinion, which would have the effect of excluding from the definition certain wetlands and other water bodies that are covered by the definition pursuant to the CWR. The process to rescind or revise the CWR will likely be subject to extensive notice and comment and litigation.\nAdditionally, we may rely on nationwide permits under the CWA Section 404 program for some of our operations. These nationwide permits are issued every five years, and the 2017 nationwide permit program was recently reissued in January 2017. If we are unable to use the nationwide permits and require an individual permit for certain work, that could delay operations.\nMany of our permits are subject to renewal from time to time, and renewed permits may contain more restrictive conditions than our existing permits. For example, many of our permits governing surface stream and groundwater discharges and impacts will be subject to new and more stringent conditions to address various new water quality requirements upon renewal over the next several years. Although we have no estimates at this time, our costs to satisfy these conditions could be substantial.\nFuture changes or challenges to the permitting and mine plan modification and approval process could cause additional increases in the costs, time, and difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with the permits and could delay or prevent commencing or continuing exploration or production operations, and as a result, adversely affect our coal production, cash flows and profitability.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies have the authority to order any of our facilities to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies have the authority following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a facility to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this were to occur, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the facility. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our facilities, our coal sales agreements and our take-or-pay contracts related to our export terminals may permit us to issue force majeure notices, which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the facilities and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery or terminate customers\u2019 contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have obligations under various settlement agreements with state and federal agencies in relation to the Alpha Restructuring settlement and the failure to meet these obligations could result in the termination of such settlement agreements, the revocation of permits and regulatory or enforcement actions, among other things.\nIn connection with the Alpha Restructuring settlement, Alpha and Contura entered into a number of agreements with state and federal agencies regarding the funding, performance and bonding of reclamation and other environmental restoration obligations with respect to mine properties retained by Alpha under the Alpha Restructuring. These agreements have been amended from time to time in connection with sales by Alpha of certain of these properties. These agreements require Contura to make periodic payments to certain accounts designated to fund reclamation and other activities at various facilities and also impose bonding, reporting and other obligations. A failure by Contura to fulfill our obligations under these agreements could be considered an event of default which could result in, among other things, the cancellation of certain permits, a termination of the agreement, termination of the right to use the funds in the Restricted Cash Reclamation Account, the Water Treatment Restricted Cash Account or the Mitigation Account and the taking of any regulatory or enforcement action that an agency enforcing such default is permitted to take.\nWe are in the process of developing systems and procedures for internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our development or implementation of these systems and procedures in a timely manner, or our internal controls or the disclosure controls related to them may have one or more material weaknesses, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are in the costly and challenging process of compiling the systems and processing the documentation necessary to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Further, during the development of these systems, it is possible that our financial statements could contain errors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported results, thus affecting our ability to finance our business. To design, maintain and improve the effectiveness of these controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available with respect to coal percentage depletion and exploration and development may be eliminated by future legislation.\nFrom time to time, legislation is proposed that could result in the reduction or elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of coal reserves. These proposals have included, but are not limited to: (1) the elimination of current deductions, the 60-month amortization period and the 10-year amortization period for exploration and development costs relating to coal and other hard mineral fossil fuels, (2) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance with respect to coal properties and (3) the repeal of capital gains treatment of coal and lignite royalties. The passage of these or other similar proposals could increase our taxable income and negatively impact our cash flows and the value of an investment in our common stock.\nChanges in tax laws, particularly in the areas of non-income taxes, or obligations arising from audits of royalties previously paid to government entities, could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate.\nWe pay non-income taxes on the coal we produce. A substantial portion of our non-income taxes are levied as a percentage of gross revenues, while others are levied on a per ton basis. Further, liabilities could arise in connection with audits of royalties previously paid to government entities in connection with our former PRB operations. If such liabilities were to arise, or if non-income tax rates were to increase significantly, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFederal healthcare legislation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, impacting our costs of providing healthcare benefits to our eligible active and certain former employees and workers\u2019 compensation benefits related to occupational disease resulting from coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (black lung). The PPACA has both short-term and long-term implications on benefit plan standards. Implementation of this legislation is expected to extend through 2022. In the short term, our healthcare costs could increase due to, among other things, an increase in the maximum age for covered dependents to receive benefits, changes to benefits for occupational disease related illnesses, the elimination of lifetime dollar limits per covered individual and restrictions on annual dollar limits per covered individual. In the long term, our healthcare costs could increase due to, among other things, an excise tax on \u201chigh cost\u201d plans and the elimination of annual dollar limits per covered individual.\nBeginning in 2022, the PPACA will impose a 40% excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds. We anticipate that certain governmental agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the PPACA, including any new regulations or interpretations, as well as efforts to limit or repeal the PPACA.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur coal mining production and delivery is subject to conditions and events beyond our control that could result in higher operating expenses and decreased production and sales. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our business and operating results and could result in impairments to our assets.\nOur coal production at our mines is subject to operating conditions and events beyond our control that could disrupt operations, affect production and the cost of mining for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results. Adverse operating conditions and events that we have experienced in the past and/or may experience in the future include:\n\u2022\nchanges or variations in geologic, hydrologic or other conditions, such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock, clay or other non-coal material embedded in or overlying the coal deposit;\n\u2022\nmining, processing and loading equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022\nlimited availability or increased costs of mining, processing and loading equipment and parts and other materials from suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with mining under or around surface obstacles;\n\u2022\nunfavorable conditions with respect to proximity to and availability, reliability and cost of transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy snows, heavy rains and flooding, lightning strikes, hurricanes or earthquakes;\n\u2022\naccidental mine water discharges, coal slurry releases and failures of an impoundment or refuse area;\n\u2022\nmine safety accidents, including fires and explosions from methane and other sources;\n\u2022\nhazards or occurrences that could result in personal injury and loss of life;\n\u2022\na shortage of skilled and unskilled labor;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches or terroristic acts;\n\u2022\nstrikes and other labor-related interruptions;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in, the unavailability of, or unexpected increases in the cost of acquiring, developing or permitting new acquisitions from the federal government and other new mining reserves and surface rights;\n\u2022\ncompetition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas;\n\u2022\nthe termination of material contracts by state or other governmental authorities; and\n\u2022\nfatalities, personal injuries or property damage arising from train derailments, mined material or overburden leaving permit boundaries, underground mine blowouts, impoundment failures, subsidence or other unexpected incidents.\nIf any of these or other conditions or events occur in the future at any of our mines or affect deliveries of our coal to customers, they may increase our cost of mining, delay or halt production or sales to our customers, result in regulatory action or lead to customers initiating claims against us. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our operating results or result in impairments to our assets.\nIn addition, our mining operations are concentrated in a small number of material mines. As a result, the effects of any of these conditions or events may be exacerbated and may have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations and assets.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of these risks. Even where covered by insurance, these risks may not be fully covered and insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Failures by insurers to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.\nA decline in demand for met coal would limit our ability to sell our high quality thermal coal as higher priced met coal, which would reduce our revenues and profitability, and could affect the economic viability of some of our mines with higher operating costs.\nWe are able to mine, process and market some of our coal reserves as either met coal or high-quality thermal coal. In deciding our approach to these reserves, we assess the conditions in the met and thermal coal markets, including factors such as the current and anticipated future market prices of met coal and thermal coal, the generally higher price of met coal as compared to thermal coal, the lower volume of saleable tons that results when producing coal for sale in the met market rather\nthan the thermal market, the increased costs of producing met coal, the likelihood of being able to secure a longer term sales commitment for thermal coal and our contractual commitments to deliver different types of coal to our customers. A decline in demand for met coal relative to thermal coal could cause us to shift coal from the met market to the thermal market, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability.\nMining in Central and Northern Appalachia is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the U.S., which could affect our mining operations and cost structures in these areas.\nThe geological characteristics of Northern and Central Appalachian coal reserves, such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness, make them complex and costly to mine. As mines become depleted, replacement reserves may not be available or, if available, may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines. In addition, compared to mines in other areas of the country, permitting, licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements are more costly and time consuming to satisfy. These factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of, and our customers\u2019 ability to use coal produced by, our mines in Northern and Central Appalachia.\nDisruptions in transportation services and increased transportation costs could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, reduce demand and adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, 54.8% of our captive coal volume was transported from our shipping points to a vessel loading point or customer location by rail. Deterioration in the reliability of the service provided by rail carriers would result in increased internal coal handling costs and decreased shipping volumes, and if we are unable to find alternatives our business could be adversely affected. Some of our operations are serviced by a single rail carrier. Due to the difficulty in arranging alternative transportation, these operations are particularly at risk to disruptions, capacity issues or other difficulties with that carrier\u2019s transportation services, which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe also depend upon trucks, beltlines, ocean vessels and barges to deliver coal to our customers. In addition, much of our eastern coal is transported from our mines to our loading facilities by trucks owned and operated by third parties. Disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, fuel and supply costs, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, terrorist attacks and other events could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, resulting in decreased shipments and revenue. Disruption in shipment levels over longer periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs, negatively affecting our revenues and results of operations.\nAn increase in transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production on a profit-making basis and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Because transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers, increases in transportation costs could also reduce overall demand for coal or make our coal production less competitive than coal produced from other sources or other regions.\nCertain provisions in our coal supply agreements may result in economic penalties upon our failure to meet specifications.\nMost of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as BTU, sulfur content, ash content, grindability, moisture and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Further, some of our coal supply agreements allow our customers to terminate the contract in the event of regulatory changes that restrict the type of coal the customer may use at its facilities or the use of that coal or increase the price of coal or the cost of using coal beyond specified limits. In addition, our coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during specified events beyond the control of the affected party. As a result of these issues, we may not achieve the revenue or profit we expect to achieve from our coal supply agreements.\nExpenditures for certain employee benefits could be materially higher than we have anticipated, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are responsible for certain liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with employees. The unfunded status of these obligations as of December 31, 2018 included $182.0 million of workers\u2019 compensation obligations, $180.8 million of pension obligations, and $92.2 million of black lung obligations. These obligations have been estimated based on assumptions including actuarial estimates, discount rates, and changes in health care costs. We could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. In addition, future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nSeveral states in which we operate consider changes in workers\u2019 compensation laws from time to time, which, if enacted, could adversely affect us.\nWe require a skilled workforce to run our business. If we cannot hire qualified persons to meet replacement or expansion needs, we may not be able to achieve planned results.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers with mining experience and proficiency as well as qualified managers and supervisors. The demand for skilled employees sometimes causes a significant constriction of the labor supply resulting in higher labor costs. We, along with the mining industry generally, are currently facing a shortage of experienced mechanics and certified electricians. When coal producers compete for skilled miners, recruiting challenges can occur and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating efficiency and costs. If a shortage of skilled workers exists and we are unable to train or retain the necessary number of miners, it could adversely affect our productivity, costs and ability to expand production.\nIf the assumptions underlying our accruals for reclamation and mine closure obligations prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nSMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as deep mining. We accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Our estimated total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities were $228.4 million as of December 31, 2018, based upon permit requirements and the historical experience at our operations, and depend on a number of variables involving assumptions and estimation and therefore may be subject to change, including the estimated future asset retirement costs and the timing of such costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins of third-party contractors, inflation rates and discount rates. Furthermore, these obligations are primarily unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition, significant changes from period to period could result in significant variability in our operating results, which could reduce comparability between periods and impact our liquidity. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for a description of our estimated costs of these liabilities.\nEstimates of our economically recoverable coal reserves involve uncertainties, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nWe base our estimates of our economically recoverable coal reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff, including various engineers and geologists, and periodically reviewed by outside firms. Our estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in our reserves are updated annually to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling, engineering or other data. These estimates depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties and factors beyond our control and may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations;\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n\u2022\nassumptions about coal prices, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. In addition, actual coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary materially from estimates. Accordingly, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves. Any inaccuracy in our reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to timely develop or acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine in a cost-effective manner coal reserves of the quality our customers need. Although we have coal reserves that we believe could support current production levels for more than 35 years, we have not yet developed the mines for all our reserves. We may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as\nwe do at our current operations. Under adverse market conditions, some reserves could not be mined profitably at all. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. As discussed above, some of these permits are becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive to obtain and the review process continues to lengthen. We may be unable to obtain the necessary permits on terms that would permit us to operate profitably or at all.\nBecause our reserves are depleted as we mine our coal, our future success and growth depend in part on our ability to timely acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our planned development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves, and we may not succeed in developing new mines or expanding existing mines beyond our existing reserves. Replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines. We may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any reserves that we now own or subsequently acquire, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results due to lost production capacity from diminished or discontinued operations at those mines, as well as lay-offs, write-off charges and other costs, potentially causing an adverse effect that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by those mines. Our ability to acquire other reserves in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates available on commercially reasonable terms, among other factors. If we are unable to replace or increase our coal reserves on acceptable terms, our production and revenues will decline as our reserves are depleted.\nIf we are unable to acquire surface rights to access our coal reserves, we may be unable to obtain a permit to mine coal we own and may be required to employ expensive techniques to mine around those sections of land we cannot access in order to access other sections of coal reserves, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nAfter we acquire coal reserves, we are required to obtain a permit to mine the reserves through the applicable state agencies prior to mining the acquired coal. In part, permitting requirements provide that, under certain circumstances, we must obtain surface owner consent if the surface estate has been severed from the mineral estate, which is commonly known as a \u201csevered estate.\u201d At certain of our mines where we have obtained the underlying coal and the surface is held by one or more owners, we are engaged in negotiations for surface rights with multiple parties. If we are unable to successfully negotiate surface rights with any or all of these surface owners, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may be denied a permit to mine some or all of our coal or may find that we cannot mine the coal at a profit. If we are denied a permit, this would create significant delays in our mining operations and materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if we decide to alter our plans to mine around the affected areas, we could incur significant additional costs to do so, which could increase our operating expenses considerably and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to complete permit transfers as expected or if there are complications in connection with the permit transfer process, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn December 8, 2017, Contura closed a transaction (\u201cPRB Transaction\u201d) with Blackjewel to sell the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines located in the PRB, including applicable permits. Alpha similarly sold properties for which the permits are in the process of being transferred. During the permit transfer period we must maintain the required reclamation bonds and related collateral, which are off-balance sheet arrangements. A local citizens organization filed objections to the permit transfer with the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council in November, 2018. The objections are scheduled to be heard in May, 2019. The Company believes that the objections are without merit. If the permit transfer process is not completed as expected, however, or if there are complications in connection with the process, we will remain obligated to maintain these bonds and collateral, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur work force could become increasingly unionized in the future and our unionized or union-free work force could strike, which could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nApproximately 84% of our total workforce and approximately 78% of our hourly workforce was union-free as of December 31, 2018. However, under the National Labor Relations Act, employees have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union. Any further unionization of our employees or the employees of third-party contractors who mine coal for us could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nCertain of Contura\u2019s subsidiaries have wage agreements with the UMWA that are subject to termination by either the employer or the UMWA, without cause, on July 31, 2020.\nAs is the case with our union-free operations, the union-represented employees could strike, which would disrupt our production, increase our costs and disrupt shipments of coal to our customers, and could result in the closure of affected mines, all of which could reduce our profitability.\nConflicts with competing holders of mineral rights and rights to use adjacent, overlying or underlying lands could materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal or do so on a cost-effective basis.\nOur operations at times face potential conflicts with holders of other mineral interests such as coalbed methane, natural gas and oil reserves. Some of these minerals are located on, or are adjacent to, some of our coal reserves and active operations, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and the holders of those interests. From time to time we acquire these minerals ourselves to prevent conflicting interests from arising. If, however, conflicting interests arise and we do not acquire the competing mineral rights, we may be required to negotiate our ability to mine with the holder of the competing mineral rights. Furthermore, the rights of third parties for competing uses of adjacent, overlying or underlying lands, such as oil and gas activity, coalbed methane, pipelines, roads, easements and public facilities, may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or arrangements cannot be negotiated. If we are unable to reach an agreement with these holders of such rights, or to do so on a cost-effective basis, we may incur increased costs and our ability to mine could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nProvisions in our lease agreements, defects in title in our mine properties or loss of leasehold rights could limit our ability to recover coal from our properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. Title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights is not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, and in some cases, title is not verified at all. Accordingly, actual or alleged defects in title or boundaries may exist, which may result in the loss of our right to mine on the property or in unanticipated costs to obtain leases or mining contracts to allow us to conduct our mining operations on the property, which could adversely affect our business and profitability. Furthermore, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and/or pay minimum production royalties. If those requirements are not met, the leasehold interest may terminate.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of key equipment and materials, including certain items mandated by regulations, or of coal that we purchase from third parties, could impact our cost of production and decrease our profitability.\nWe depend on reliable supplies of mining equipment, replacement parts and materials such as explosives, diesel fuel, tires, steel, magnetite and other raw materials and consumables which, in some cases, do not have ready substitutes. Some equipment and materials are needed to comply with regulations, such as proximity detection devices on continuous mining machines. The supplier base providing mining materials and equipment has been relatively consistent in recent years, although there continues to be consolidation, which has resulted in a limited number of suppliers for certain types of equipment and supplies. Any significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of any mining equipment or key supplies could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, the prices we pay for these materials are strongly influenced by the global commodities markets. Coal mines consume large quantities of commodities such as steel, copper, rubber products, explosives and diesel and other liquid fuels. If the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies with respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses will increase, which could materially adversely impact our profitability. Some materials, such as steel, are needed to comply with regulatory requirements. Furthermore, operating expenses at our mining locations are sensitive to changes in certain variable costs, including diesel fuel prices, which is one of our largest variable costs. Our results depend on our ability to adequately control our costs. Any increase in the price we pay for diesel fuel will have a negative impact on our results of operations. A rapid or significant increase in the cost of these commodities could increase our mining costs because we have limited ability to negotiate lower prices.\nWe purchase coal from third parties, for use in coal blending and for other purposes, for which ready substitutes may not be immediately available. A significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of these supplies, or the failure of third party coal producers to provide them in a timely fashion, could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nSome of our mines are operated by third-party contract mine operators, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if these operators fail to operate the mines effectively.\nSome of our mines are operated by third-party contract mine operators. While we have certain contractual rights of oversight over these mines, which are operated under our permits, we do not control, and our employees do not participate in, the day-to-day operations of these mines. Operational difficulties at these mines, increased competition for contract miners from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability, cost and quality of coal produced for us by contractors. Disruption in our supply of contractor-produced coal could impair our ability to fill our customers\u2019 orders or require us to pay higher prices to obtain the required coal from other sources. Any increase in the per-ton compensation for services we pay for the production of contractor-produced coal could increase our costs and therefore lower our earnings and adversely affect our results of operations.\nStrategic transactions, including acquisitions, involve a number of risks, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the future, we may undertake strategic transactions such as the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets, interests in coal mining companies, joint ventures or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. Our ability to complete these transactions is subject to the availability of attractive opportunities, including potential acquisition targets that can be successfully integrated into our existing business and provide us with complementary capabilities, products or services on terms acceptable to us, as well as general market conditions, among other things.\nRisks inherent in these strategic transactions include:\n\u2022\nuncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent liabilities and other liabilities of acquisition candidates and strategic partners;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers, management and employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies from an acquisition or other strategic transactions in the amounts and on the time frame due to inaccurate assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings, the deterioration of general industry and business conditions, unanticipated legal, insurance and financial compliance costs, or other factors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of management to manage successfully our exposure to pending and potential litigation and regulatory obligations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in competition that limit our ability to expand our business or capitalize on expected business opportunities, including retaining current customers; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business, industry, market, or general economic conditions that differ from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the acquisition or other strategic transactions.\nThe ultimate success of any strategic transaction we may undertake will depend in part on our ability to continue to realize the anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from those transactions. We may not be able to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties that we acquire, invest in or partner with. Problems that could arise from the integration of an acquired business may involve:\n\u2022\ncoordinating management and personnel and managing different corporate cultures;\n\u2022\napplying our safety and environmental programs at acquired mines and facilities;\n\u2022\nestablishing, testing and maintaining effective internal control processes and systems of financial reporting for the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s and our finance and accounting staff\u2019s resources and time commitments, and the disruption of either our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing businesses;\n\u2022\ntax costs or inefficiencies; and\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, information technology systems, procedures or policies.\nAny one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated from a strategic transaction, adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees or other third parties or reduce our earnings.\nMoreover, any strategic transaction we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or do both. Future transactions could also result in our assuming more long-term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets. Further, acquisition accounting rules require changes in certain assumptions made subsequent to the measurement period, as defined in current accounting standards, to be recorded in current period earnings, which could affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit our ability to utilize our tax net operating loss carryforwards or maintain our deferred tax assets.\nWe acquired the core coal assets of Predecessor Alpha as part of Predecessor Alpha\u2019s bankruptcy restructuring in transactions intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of these transactions, we inherited the tax basis of the core assets and the net operating loss and other carryforwards of Predecessor Alpha. These carryforwards and tax basis were subject to reduction on December 31, 2016 due to the cancellation of indebtedness resulting from Predecessor Alpha\u2019s bankruptcy restructuring. Due to the change in ownership, the net operating loss and other carryforwards will be subjected to limitations on their use in future years. In addition, we do not have a long history of operating results, and if we are unable to generate profits in the future, we may be unable to utilize these carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, a valuation allowance of $94.8 million has been provided on federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and gross deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits.\nNegative or unexpected consequences of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could affect our business.\nOn December 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) significantly revised U.S. federal corporate tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, providing a mechanism for corporations to monetize alternative minimum tax credits (\u201cAMT Credits\u201d) during the 2018 to 2021 tax years, limiting the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, allowing immediate expensing for certain new investments, and, effective for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, permitting indefinite net operating loss carryforwards, and limiting the use of net operating loss carryforwards to 80% of current year taxable income.\nThere are a number of uncertainties and ambiguities as to the interpretation and application of many of the provisions in the TCJA. In the absence of guidance of these issues, we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in interpreting and applying the TCJA for purposes of determining our cash tax liabilities and results of operations, which may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the TCJA evolves over time. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the interpretations and assumptions that we previously made, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, which we may be unable to provide.\nOur business plan and strategy require substantial capital expenditures. We require capital for, among other purposes, acquisition of surface rights, equipment and the development of our mining operations, capital renovations, maintenance and expansions of plants and equipment and compliance with safety, health and environmental laws and regulations. Future debt or equity financing may not be available or, if available, may result in dilution or not be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates and we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or change our business strategy, sell assets or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments and other assets or liabilities that are marked to market could cause volatility in our earnings.\nPursuant to the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession, dated May 27, 2016, as modified and confirmed by the Order Confirming Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession, as Modified (Docket No. 3038), entered by the Bankruptcy Court on July 12, 2016, we have contingent revenue payment obligations to certain of Alpha\u2019s creditors, which are recorded at fair market value and marked to market in each reporting period, with changes in value reflected in earnings. Any change in fair value can have a significant impact on our earnings from period to period, including in the future.\nCybersecurity attacks, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other similar crises or disruptions may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or those of our customers and suppliers.\nOur business, or the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be impacted by disruptions such as cybersecurity attacks or failures, threats to physical security, and extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the U.S. These disruptions or any significant increases in energy prices that follow could result in government-imposed price controls. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, as cybersecurity\nattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nOur indebtedness exposes us to various risks.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $632.8 million of indebtedness outstanding before discounts and issuance costs applied for financial reporting, of which $149.0 million will mature in the next three years.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022\nforce us to seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our debts, or sell assets;\n\u2022\ncause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n\u2022\ncause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service, reducing the availability of working capital and delaying or preventing investments, capital expenditures, research and development and other business activities;\n\u2022\ncause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of foreclosure on substantially all of our assets and those of most of our subsidiaries, which secure certain of our indebtedness if we default on payment or are unable to comply with covenants or restrictions in any of the agreements;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nresult in a downgrade in the credit ratings of our indebtedness, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness and result in more restrictive borrowing terms, including increased borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants, all of which could affect our internal cost of capital estimates and therefore impact operational and investment decisions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future cash flow from operations and our ability to restructure or refinance our debt, which will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. We may incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness in the future, subject to compliance with covenants in our existing debt agreements. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, and the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Alpha Merger, we incurred indebtedness of approximately $550 million under a term loan facility to refinance existing indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses, and borrowing capacity of $225 million under a revolving credit facility. Additionally, as a result of the Alpha Merger, we assumed a letter of credit agreement and a credit and security agreement which, among other things, include letter of credit facilities that provide for the issuance of letters of credit. The terms of our credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe term loan facility matures on November 9, 2025 and the revolving credit facility matures on April 3, 2022. The term loan facility permits us, subject to approval of the administrative agent and the lenders providing the financing, to request incremental term loans up to an aggregate amount of $150 million plus additional amounts subject to a First Lien Leverage Ratio test and other specified conditions, in increments not less than $25 million or the remaining availability. The revolving loan facility permits us, subject to approval of the administrative agent and the lenders providing the financing, to request incremental revolving commitment increases up to an aggregate amount of $50 million, in increments not less than $10 million or the remaining availability and subject to specified conditions.\nWe are subject to various operating and financial covenants under the term loan and revolving credit facilities which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make particular types of investments, incur certain\ntypes of liens, engage in fundamental corporate changes, enter into transactions with affiliates, make substantial asset sales, make certain restricted payments, enter into amendments or waivers to certain agreements, conduct certain sale leasebacks or enter into certain burdensome agreements. Any failure to comply with these covenants may constitute a breach under the term loan and revolving credit facilities which could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments under the term loan and revolving credit facilities. Our inability to maintain our term loan and revolving credit facilities could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our business. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the operating and financial covenants under the term loan and revolving credit facilities.\nPressure on our business, cash flow and liquidity could materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our business operations or react to and withstand changing market and industry conditions. Additional sources of funds may not be available.\nA significant source of liquidity is our cash balance. Access to additional funds from liquidity-generating transactions or other sources of external financing may not be available to us and, if available, would be subject to market conditions and certain limitations including our credit rating and covenant restrictions in our credit facility.\nOur ability to make the required payments on our indebtedness depends on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be constrained by legal, contractual, market or operating conditions from paying dividends to us.\nWe will depend to a significant extent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make that cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. These subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of these subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nFailure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations, which could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal.\nFederal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term obligations such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers\u2019 compensation costs (including related to black lung), coal leases and other obligations. These bonds are typically renewable annually. Under applicable regulations, self-bonding may not be available to us as a means to comply with our reclamation bonding obligations for the foreseeable future. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds, may demand less favorable terms upon renewal or may impose new or increased collateral requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties of approximately $581.4 million. Surety bond issuers and holders may demand additional collateral, unfavorable terms or higher fees. Our failure to retain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal, which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. That failure could result from a variety of factors, including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms, the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety bonds, restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit arrangements then in place, or our inability to comply with our reclamation bonding obligations through self-bonding. In addition, as a result of increasing credit pressures on the coal industry, it is possible that surety bond providers could demand cash collateral as a condition to providing or maintaining surety bonds. Any such demands, depending on the amount of any cash collateral required, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position. If we are unable to meet cash collateral requirements and cannot otherwise obtain or retain required surety bonds, we may be unable to satisfy legal requirements necessary to conduct our mining operations.\nDifficulty in acquiring surety bonds, or additional collateral requirements, would increase our costs and likely require greater use of alternative sources of funding for this purpose, which would reduce our liquidity. If we are unable to provide the financial assurance that is required by state and federal law to secure our reclamation and coal lease obligations, our ability to mine or lease coal and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe terms of our borrowing arrangements limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take certain actions, which may limit our operating and financial flexibility and adversely affect our business.\nOur borrowing arrangements contain, and any future borrowing arrangements are also likely to contain, a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of certain capital\nstock, make loans and investments, create liens, sell certain assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, and merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. We regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure and financial flexibility through a variety of methods, including repayment or repurchase of outstanding debt, amendment of our credit facility and other facilities, and other methods. As a result of any of these actions, the restrictions and covenants that apply to us may become more restrictive or otherwise change.\nOperating results below current levels, or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with our covenants and payment obligations contained in our borrowing arrangements. If we violate these covenants or obligations under any of these agreements and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders, our debt under all of these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe need to maintain capacity for required letters of credit could limit our ability to provide financial assurance for self-insured obligations and negatively impact our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditure or other general corporate requirements.\nOn November 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement. Additionally, as a result of the Alpha Merger, the Company assumed an Amended and Restated Letter of Credit Agreement and a Credit and Security Agreement. Each of these agreements includes, among other things, provisions that provide for the issuance of letters of credit. Obligations secured by letters of credit may increase in the future. If we do not maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under our letter of credit facilities, we may be unable to provide financial assurance for self-insured obligations and could negatively impact our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditure or other general corporate requirements.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we will need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NYSE, with which we are not currently required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time for our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We will need to:\n\u2022\ninstitute a more comprehensive compliance function;\n\u2022\ncomply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies; and\n\u2022\nretain and involve to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIn addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile.\nContura\u2019s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cCTRA\u201d. Active, liquid and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be maintained, however. The market price of our common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our common stock.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect our stock price:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance, including reserve estimates;\n\u2022\nan unexpected mine or environmental incident;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;\n\u2022\nthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nresearch analysts\u2019 coverage of our common stock, or their failure to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our directors or officers or the selling stockholders or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022\nour payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022\npublic sentiment regarding climate change and fossil fuels;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of any risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or described elsewhere in this document.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities in subsequent public offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock or the dividend amount payable per share on our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock or the dividend amount payable per share on our common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options will result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders. In addition, the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants will result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the\nhappening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts currently publish these research reports, but there is no guarantee they will continue to publish them in the future. If securities or industry analysts initiate coverage and one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and the instruments governing our debt may discourage a takeover attempt even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201camended and restated certificate of incorporation\u201d) and second amended and restated bylaws (the \u201camended and restated bylaws\u201d) could impose impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nA change of control (as defined under the instruments governing our debt) is an event of default, permitting our lenders to accelerate the maturity of certain borrowings. Further, our borrowing arrangements impose other restrictions on us, including with respect to mergers or consolidations with other companies and the sale of substantially all of our assets. These provisions could prevent or deter a third-party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any class or series of preferred stock) or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18224, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "CTRA"}
