{"cik": "730263", "company": "THOR INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face and represent risks that our management believes are material to our Company and our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem not material may also harm our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive both in the United States and in Europe.\nThe industry in which we are engaged is highly competitive. The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by relatively low barriers to entry, which results in numerous existing and potential recreational vehicle manufacturing competitors. A number of our operating subsidiaries also compete with each other. Competition is based upon price, design, value, quality and service as well as other factors. Competitive pressures have, from time to time, resulted in a reduction of our profit margins and/or a reduction in our market share. Sustained increases in these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If existing or new competitors develop products that are superior to ours or that achieve better consumer acceptance or if existing competitors offer similar products at a lower net price to dealers, our market share, sales volume and profit margins may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to direct manufacturing competitors, we also compete against consumer demand for used recreational vehicles, particularly during periods of economic downturn. The availability of used recreational vehicles and the pricing differential between used and new recreational vehicles are among the primary factors which impact the competitiveness of used vehicle sales.\nOur U.S.-based operations are primarily centered in northern Indiana.\nThe majority of our U.S. operations are located in one region. The geographic centrality of the RV industry in northern Indiana, where the majority of our facilities are located, creates certain risks, including:\n\u25cf\nCompetition for workers skilled in the industry, especially during times of low unemployment, may increase the cost of our labor or limit the speed at which we can respond to changes in consumer demand;\n\u25cf\nEmployee retention and recruitment challenges, as employees with industry knowledge and experience may be attracted to the most lucrative positions and their ability to change employers is relatively easy; and\n\u25cf\nPotential for greater adverse impact from natural disasters.\nOur business is both cyclical and seasonal and subject to fluctuations in sales, production and net income.\nThe RV industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nIn addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant variability in quarterly sales, production and net income as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Since recreational vehicles are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand in the recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the fall and winter months, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Independent dealer demand and buying patterns also impact the timing of shipments from one quarter to another. In addition, severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another. The seasonality of our business may negatively impact quarterly operating results.\nOur business may be affected by certain external factors beyond our control.\nCompanies within the recreational vehicle industry are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors, such as general economic conditions, credit availability, consumer confidence, employment rates, prevailing interest rates, inflation, other economic conditions affecting consumer attitudes and disposable consumer income, demographic changes and political changes. Specific external factors affecting our business include:\n\u25cf\nOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u25cf\nRaw material and commodity price fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nAvailability of raw materials and components used in production;\n\u25cf\nLegislative, regulatory and tax law and/or policy developments including their potential impact on our dealers and their retail customers or on our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nInterest rate fluctuations and the availability of credit;\n\u25cf\nSuccess of new and existing products and services;\n\u25cf\nConsumer preferences;\n\u25cf\nIndependent dealer confidence and stocking levels;\n\u25cf\nRV retail consumer demographics;\n\u25cf\nEmployment and wage trends;\n\u25cf\nConsolidation of independent RV dealerships;\n\u25cf\nGlobal, domestic or regional financial turmoil;\n\u25cf\nNatural disasters;\n\u25cf\nRelative or perceived cost, availability and comfort of recreational vehicle use versus other modes of travel, such as car, air or rail travel; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic, market and political conditions, including war, terrorism and military conflict.\nThe loss of our largest independent dealer could have a significant effect on our business.\nSales to FreedomRoads, LLC accounted for 18.5% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019. During recent years, FreedomRoads, LLC has acquired a number of formerly independent RV dealerships which has impacted our sales to FreedomRoads, LLC. Future consolidation of dealerships by FreedomRoads, LLC could impact our sales, concentration of sales to this key dealer and our exposure under repurchase obligations.\nThe loss of this dealer could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of FreedomRoads, LLC could negatively impact our sales and accounts receivable and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements.\nFuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on sales of our recreational vehicles.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of our vehicles or the vehicles which tow our products. Shortages or rationing of gasoline and diesel fuel, and significant, sudden increases in the price of fuel have had a material adverse effect on the recreational vehicle industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.\nBusiness acquisitions pose integration risks.\nOur growth has been both internal and by acquisition. Business acquisitions, joint ventures and the merger or combination of subsidiaries within Thor, pose a number of potential integration risks that may result in negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The pace and significance of acquisitions; the integration of acquired companies, assets, operations and joint venture arrangements and the merger of subsidiaries within Thor involve a number of related risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nThe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to various transaction and integration activities;\n\u25cf\nThe potential for disruption to existing operations and plans;\n\u25cf\nThe assimilation and retention of employees, including key employees;\n\u25cf\nRisks related to transacting business in new geographies and regulatory environments in which we are unaccustomed, including but not limited to: foreign currency exchange rate changes, expanded macro-economic risks due to operations in and sales to a wide base of countries, political and regulatory exposures to countries in which we formerly did not do business, different employee/employer relationships, including the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor organizations, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\nThe ability of our management teams to manage expanded operations, including international operations, to meet operational and financial expectations;\n\u25cf\nThe integration of departments and systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, controls and procedures;\n\u25cf\nThe adverse impact on profitability if expanded or combined operations do not achieve expected financial results or realize the synergies and other benefits expected;\n\u25cf\nThe potential loss of, or adverse effects on, existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf\nThe assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses, which could be greater than anticipated; and\n\u25cf\nThe potential adverse impact on operating results due to the use of estimates, which are subject to significant management judgment, in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-offs of significant amounts of goodwill and other assets.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.\nCombined sales from the United States to foreign countries (predominately Canada) and sales from our foreign subsidiary (since the February 1, 2019 date of acquisition) to countries other than the U.S. (predominately within the European Union) represent approximately 26.2% of Thor\u2019s consolidated sales for fiscal 2019. These non-U.S. sales create the potential for numerous risks which could impact our financial operating results, including foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in supply or distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and various employee work agreements, as well as economic and social instability. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.\nGlobal political and economic uncertainty and shifts, such as the ongoing negotiations to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union (Brexit), pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. dealers, end customers, employees, or prospective employees, all of which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. Our success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact our international operations or the business as a whole.\nThe Company\u2019s level of debt may make us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; and provisions in our debt agreements could constrain the options available to us to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe incurred and assumed various debt obligations as a result of the EHG acquisition on February 1, 2019. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into a new term loan agreement with USD and EUR tranches ($1.4 billion USD and \u0080618 million EUR, respectively) and a $750 million Asset-Based Loan (\u201cABL\u201d). We also assumed various existing debt obligations from EHG as of the acquisition date. As of July 31, 2019, we have outstanding debt of approximately $1.9 billion. Our current level of debt directly impacts our results of operations because a portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing our debt. In addition, our current level of debt could impair our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, or increase borrowing costs on future debt, and may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to repay indebtedness and placing us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with lower debt obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, capital investment and working capital requirements, we may need to fund those requirements with borrowings from the ABL, or reduce or cease our payments of dividends, we may be unable to repurchase our shares, or we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets.\nFurthermore, our credit facilities contain certain provisions that limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u25cf\nDeclare dividends or repurchase capital stock;\n\u25cf\nPrepay or purchase other debt;\n\u25cf\nIncur liens;\n\u25cf\nMake loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u25cf\nIncur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nAmend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u25cf\nEngage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales; and\n\u25cf\nEngage in transactions with non-loan party affiliates.\nOur business depends on the performance of independent dealers and transportation carriers.\nWe distribute all of our North American and the majority of our European products through a system of independent, non-franchise authorized dealers, many of whom sell products from competing manufacturers. The Company depends on the capability of these independent authorized dealers to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the products that the dealers purchase from the Company. If the Company\u2019s independent dealers are not successful in these endeavors, then the Company may be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations. The geographic coverage of our independent dealers and their individual business conditions can affect the ability of our authorized dealers to sell our products to consumers. If our independent dealers are unsuccessful, they may exit or be forced to exit the business or, in some cases, the Company may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealerships. As a result, the Company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of independent dealer relationships. For example, the unplanned loss of any of the Company\u2019s independent dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage of our products. In addition, recent consolidation of independent dealers, as well as the growth of larger, multi-location dealers, may result in increased bargaining power on the part of independent dealers.\nOur products are generally delivered to our dealers via a system of independent transportation contractors. The network of carriers is limited and, in times of high demand and limited availability, can create risk in, and disruption of, our distribution channel.\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of financing to independent dealers and retail purchasers.\nGenerally, independent recreational vehicle dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. A decrease in the availability of this type of wholesale financing, more restrictive lending practices or an increase in the cost of such wholesale financing can prevent independent dealers from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which limits product offerings and could lead to reduced demand. Two major floor plan financial institutions held approximately 63% of our portion of our dealers\u2019 total floored dollars outstanding at July 31, 2019. In the event that either of these lending institutions limit or discontinue dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSubstantial or sudden increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had an adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the past and may do so in the future. Further, a decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from unfavorable economic conditions, or an increase in the cost of consumer credit, may cause consumers to reduce discretionary spending which could, in turn, reduce demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nChanges in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales.\nWe cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for recreational vehicles in general, and our products in particular, will remain unchanged. Recreational vehicles are generally used for recreational purposes, and demand for our products may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs and models will be critical to the future success of our recreational vehicle operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce revenues from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our revenues may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors\u2019 new products may obtain better market acceptance or render our products obsolete.\nIf the frequency and size of product liability and other claims against us increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation involving product liability and other claims against us, including, without limitation, wrongful death, personal injury and warranties. In North America, we generally self-insure a portion of our product liability and other claims and also purchase product liability and other insurance in the commercial insurance market. In North America, upon exhaustion of relatively higher deductibles or retentions, we maintain a full line of insurance coverage. In Europe, we generally fully insure similar risks with insurance offering relatively low deductibles or premiums. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Any increase in the frequency and size of claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to increase significantly and may negatively impact future self-insured retention levels. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance.\nAn introduction of new products into the marketplace or enhanced standard warranty coverage of our products, may result in expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, can result in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new models, floor plans and features are critical to our future success. We may incur unexpected expenses, however, when we introduce new models, floor plans or features. For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design flaws that will force a recall of a new product or may cause increased warranty costs. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates, due to either the introduction of new products or extended warranty coverage, could result in increased warranty reserves and expense which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nOur chassis supply, and therefore sales, may be impacted by new European emissions standards being implemented.\nUncertainties related to changing European emission standards may impact the availability of chassis used in our production of certain European motorized RVs and could also impact consumer buying patterns, which could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings.\nPrior to the EHG acquisition, EHG was a privately-held company and its new obligations arising from being a part of a public company may require significant additional resources and management attention.\nUpon the completion of the EHG acquisition, EHG and its subsidiaries became subsidiaries of our consolidated Company and will need to comply with U.S. GAAP financial reporting, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We will need to ensure that EHG establishes and maintains effective disclosure controls as well as internal controls and procedures for financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, and such compliance efforts may be costly and may divert the attention of management. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures and functions that must be integrated, or enhanced at EHG, particularly those related to the implementation of internal controls for SOX compliance. The execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the realization of efficiencies related to the combination of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.\nOur repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders could result in increased costs.\nIn accordance with customary practice in the recreational vehicle industry, upon the request of a lending institution financing an independent dealer\u2019s purchase of our products, we will generally execute a repurchase agreement with the lending institution. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to 18 months after a recreational vehicle is financed and in the event of default by the dealer, we will repurchase the recreational vehicle repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is usually less than 100% of the dealer\u2019s cost.\nIn addition to the guarantee under these repurchase agreements, we may also be required to repurchase inventory relative to dealer terminations in certain states in accordance with state laws or regulatory requirements. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the original sale price, is an expense to us. Thus, if we are obligated to repurchase a substantially greater number of recreational vehicles, or incur substantially greater discounting to resell these units in the future, those circumstances would increase our costs. In difficult economic times this amount could increase significantly compared to recent years.\nFor some of the components used in production, we depend on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components timely or at competitive prices, which would decrease our sales and profit margins. Additionally, continued consolidation of our major suppliers further limits alternative supply sources, which could increase costs and decrease our sales and profit margins. Finally, certain raw material components may be sourced from countries where we do not have operations, and delays in obtaining these components, along with added tariffs, could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins.\nWe depend on timely and sufficient delivery of components from our suppliers. Most components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, a few key components are currently produced by only a small group of suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities, primarily occurring in the case of: 1) motorized chassis, where there are a limited number of chassis suppliers, and 2) windows and doors, towable chassis and slide-out mechanisms, axles and upholstered furniture for our recreational vehicles, where LCI Industries is a major supplier for these items within the North American RV industry.\nThe recreational vehicle industry as a whole has, from time to time, experienced shortages of motorized chassis due to the concentration or allocation of available resources by suppliers of these chassis. Historically, in the event of an industry-wide restriction of supply, suppliers have generally allocated chassis among us and our competitors based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. If certain suppliers were to discontinue the manufacturing of motorhome chassis, or if, as a group, our chassis suppliers significantly reduced the availability of chassis to the industry, our business would be adversely affected. Similarly, shortages at, or production delays or work stoppages by the employees of chassis suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our sales. If the condition of the auto industry were to significantly deteriorate, that deterioration could also result in supply interruptions and a decrease in our sales and earnings while we obtain replacement chassis from other sources.\nLCI Industries is a major North American supplier of a number of key components of our recreational vehicles such as windows and doors, towable chassis and slide-out mechanisms, axles and upholstered furniture. We have not experienced any significant shortages or delays in delivery related to these items; however, if industry demand were to increase faster than LCI Industries can respond, or other factors impact their ability to continue to supply our needs for these key components, our business could be adversely affected.\nContinued consolidation of our major suppliers may inhibit our ability to source from alternative suppliers and could result in increased component costs, which may result in decreased margins or higher wholesale product costs, which could result in decreased sales.\nIn addition, certain RV components are sourced from countries where we do not currently have operations. Changes in trade policy and resulting tariffs that have or may be imposed, along with port, production or other delays, could cause increased costs for, or shortages of, certain RV components or sub-components. We may not be able to source alternative supplies as necessary without increased costs or at all. If alternatives are not readily available, that unavailability could lead to potential decreases in our sales and earnings.\nFinally, as is standard in the industry, arrangements with chassis and other suppliers are generally terminable at any time by either our Company or the supplier. If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of chassis or other key components, this could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time, including from vendor-supplied parts, that can result in decreased sales and gross margin and could harm our reputation.\nOur products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. As with all of our competitors, defects may occur in our products, including those purchased from our vendors. We cannot assure you that we will detect all such defects prior to distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel our suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the ability to financially rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs and could harm our reputation.\nOur business is subject to numerous national, regional, federal, state and local regulations in the various countries in which we operate and/or sell our products.\nOur operations are subject to numerous national, regional, federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products, including various vehicle and component safety and compliance standards. In various jurisdictions, governmental agencies require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles which contain certain hazards or defects. Any recalls of our vehicles, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could harm our reputation. Additionally, changes in policy, regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur U.S. operations are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \u201clemon laws.\u201d U.S. federal and state, as well as various European laws and regulations, impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. U.S. federal and state, as well as various European, authorities have environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect our business and operations.\nFurther, certain other U.S. and European laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities. Areas of our business affected by such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor, advertising, real estate, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property, tax, import and export duties, tariffs, anti-corruption, anti-competition, environmental, privacy, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which further complicates compliance efforts. Violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties, including restraints on our export or import privileges, monetary fines, criminal or civil proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could result in retaliatory trade policies by one or more U.S. trading partners.\nThe recent imposition of tariffs on steel, aluminum and other raw materials imported into the United States has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. New and/or increased tariffs by the United States and/or by other countries could subject the Company to increased costs for RV components that we import into the United States. Increased costs for imported RV components could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, may result in lower margins on products sold.\nAs a publicly-traded company, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.\nFailure as a public company to comply with relevant rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the New York Stock Exchange could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these rules or regulations and the implementation of new rules or regulations could increase compliance, reporting, or other operating or administrative costs, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAs a public company, we may be required to disclose certain information that may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors.\nInterruption of information service or misappropriation or breach of our information systems could cause disruption to our operations and the accumulation and reporting of operating results, cause disclosure of confidential information or cause damage to our reputation.\nOur business relies on information systems and other technology (\u201cinformation systems\u201d) to support aspects of our business operations, including but not limited to, procurement, supply chain management, manufacturing, design, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems to accumulate, analyze and report our operational results. In connection with our use of information systems, we obtain, create and maintain confidential information. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our marketing and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, we have established various levels of security, backup and disaster recovery procedures. Our business processes and operations may, however, be negatively impacted in the event of a substantial disruption of service or cyber-attacks.\nThe methods and technologies used to obtain unauthorized access to our information systems are constantly changing and may be difficult to anticipate. While we have implemented and periodically review security measures and processes designed to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems, we may not be able to anticipate and effectively prevent unauthorized access or data loss in the future. The misuse, leakage, unauthorized access or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), and damage to our reputation which could, in turn, have a significant, negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement and misappropriation by defending our intellectual property rights. To protect these rights, we rely on intellectual property laws of the U.S., Germany, Canada, and other countries, as well as contractual and other legal rights. We seek to acquire the rights to intellectual property necessary for our operations. However, our measures may not be successful in any given instance, particularly in countries outside the U.S. We endeavor to protect our rights; however, third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights. We may be forced to take steps to protect our rights, including through litigation, which could result in a diversion of resources.\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could result in competitors undermining the value of our brands by, among other initiatives, manufacturing and marketing similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations. Moreover, competitors or other third parties may challenge or seek to invalidate or avoid the application of our existing or future intellectual property rights that we receive or license. The loss of protection for our intellectual property could reduce the market value of our brands and our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operation.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property or damage our reputation. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill for impairment. Long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, a non-cash impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Our determination of future cash flows, future recoverability and fair value of our long-lived assets includes significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in those estimates or assumptions or lower-than-anticipated future financial performance may result in the identification of an impaired asset and a non-cash impairment charge, which could be material. Any such charge could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial.\nWe rely on the existence of an available, qualified workforce to manufacture our products. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. Within our European-based operations, we are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations. Any disruption in our relationships with these third-party associations, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nWe could be impacted by the potential adverse effects of union activities.\nWhile our European-based operations are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations, none of our North American employees are currently represented by a labor union. Unionization of any of our North American facilities could result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We are, directly or indirectly, dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon the services of our executive management and other key individuals, and their loss could materially harm us.\nWe rely upon the knowledge, experience and skills of our executive management and other key employees to compete effectively in our business and manage our operations. Our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain executive management, key employees and other qualified personnel. Upon the departure of such employees, our success may depend upon the existence of adequate succession plans. The loss of our executive management or other key employees or the failure to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us in the event that our succession plans prove inadequate.\nProduction efficiency related to new facilities may not be realized or we may incur unanticipated costs or delays that could adversely affect operating results.\nThe development and/or expansion of certain products and models may require the construction, improvement, re-configuration, relocation or expansion of production facilities. These development and expansion activities may be delayed, or we may incur unanticipated costs or not achieve the intended efficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe relative strength of the U.S. dollar may impact sales denominated in U.S. dollars.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. based subsidiaries have expenses and sales denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales into the Canadian market are subject to currency risk as devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar may negatively impact U.S. dollar sales into Canada. With the acquisition of EHG, the Company has acquired Euro-denominated assets which are subject to changes in the Euro and U.S. dollar currency rate. To offset a portion of this currency risk, the acquisition was partially funded through a Euro-denominated Term Loan B which provides an economic hedge.\nEHG\u2019s expenses are predominantly denominated in Euro. EHG\u2019s sales are denominated in Euro, with the exception of sales in the U.K. market, where sales are denominated in Pound Sterling. The Company has used foreign currency forward contracts to manage certain foreign exchange rate exposure related to anticipated sales transactions in Pound Sterling with financial instruments whose maturity date, along with the realized gain or loss, occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction. However, at July 31, 2019, the Company did not have any currency forward contracts outstanding. Within EHG there are assets held in non-Euro currencies, with most of these assets related to the RV rental business. Where possible these assets have been funded by debt in the local currency which economically offsets the underlying currency risk.\nThor uses net investment hedge accounting to mitigate the impact on its financial statements of changes in the Euro and U.S. dollar currency to the Euro-denominated Term Loan B.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes.\nOur policies, procedures, controls and oversight to monitor and manage our enterprise risks may not be fully effective in achieving their purpose and may leave exposure to identified or unidentified risks. Past or future misconduct by our employees or vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. The Company monitors its policies, procedures and controls; however, our policies, procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent all forms of misconduct. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall enterprise risk management program, but it is possible that our compensation policies could incentivize inappropriate risk taking or misconduct. If such inappropriate risk taking or misconduct occurs, it is possible that it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our financial condition.\nIncreases in healthcare, workers compensation or other employee benefit costs could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWithin our U.S. based operations, the Company incurs significant costs with respect to employee healthcare and workers compensation benefits. The Company is self-insured for these employee healthcare and workers compensation benefits up to certain defined retention limits. If costs related to these or other employee benefits increase as a result of increased healthcare costs in the U.S., increased utilization of such benefits as a result of increased claims, new or revised U.S. governmental mandates or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may suffer. Within our European-based operations, the Company incurs significant costs with respect to employee benefits which are largely governed by country and regional regulations. New or revised governmental mandates may cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire our Company and could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains certain supermajority voting provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors, amend our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or take other corporate actions.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that could delay, deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition, including provisions which prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may deprive investors of an opportunity to sell shares at a premium over prevailing prices.\nOur stock price may fluctuate in response to various conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market, in general, experiences volatility that has often been unrelated to the underlying operating performance of companies. If this volatility continues, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly, independent of our actual operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nDevelopment of new products and features by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nDevelopment of new collaborative arrangements by us, our competitors or other parties;\n\u25cf\nChanges in government regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nChanges in investor perception of our business and/or management;\n\u25cf\nChanges in global economic conditions or general market conditions in our industry;\n\u25cf\nOccurrence of major catastrophic events; and\n\u25cf\nSales of our common stock held by certain equity investors or members of management.\nPrice volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company\u2019s stock price may reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company\u2019s stock price may also reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Furthermore, and as is customary under credit facilities generally, certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares, are subject to the satisfaction of certain payment conditions prior to payment. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the Company might miss investor expectations or independent analyst estimates, which might result in analysts or investors changing their opinions and/or recommendations regarding our stock and our stock price may decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.", "PERMNO": 76081, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "THO"}
