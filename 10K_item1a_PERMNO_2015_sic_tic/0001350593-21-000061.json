{"cik": "1350593", "company": "Mueller Water Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to our industries\nA significant portion of our business depends on spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity.\nOur primary end markets are repair and replacement of water infrastructure, driven by municipal spending and new water infrastructure installation driven by new residential construction. As a result, a significant portion of our business depends on local, state and federal spending on water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement. Funds for water and wastewater infrastructure repair and replacement typically come from local taxes, water fees and water rates. State and local governments and private water entities that do not adequately budget for expenditures when setting tax rates, water rates and water fees, as applicable, may be unable to pay for water infrastructure repair and replacement if they do not have access to other funding sources. In addition, reductions or delays in federal spending related to water or wastewater infrastructure could adversely affect state or local projects and may adversely affect our financial results.\nGovernments and private water entities may have limited abilities to increase taxes, water fees or water rates, as applicable. It is not unusual for water and wastewater projects to be delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities, increasing interest rates, inflation and difficulties in complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. For example, changes in interest rates and credit markets, including municipal bonds, mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit, can significantly increase the costs of the projects in which our products are utilized, such as in new residential construction and water and wastewater infrastructure upgrade, repair and replacement projects, and lead to such projects being reduced, delayed and/or rescheduled, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, higher interest rates are often accompanied by inflation. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and cash flows.\nSome state and local governments may place significant restrictions on the use of water by their constituents and/or increase their water conservation efforts. These types of water use restrictions and water conservation efforts may lead to reduced water revenues by private water entities, municipalities or other governmental agencies, which could similarly affect funding decisions for water-related projects.\nPoor economic conditions may cause states, municipalities or private water entities to receive lower than anticipated revenues, which may lead to reduced or delayed funding for water infrastructure projects. Even if favorable economic conditions exist, water infrastructure owners may choose not to address deferred infrastructure needs as a result of a variety of political factors or competing spending priorities.\nLow levels of spending for water and wastewater infrastructure construction activity could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows.\nResidential construction activity is important to our business and adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty within this market could adversely affect our financial results.\nNew water and wastewater infrastructure spending is heavily dependent upon residential construction. As a result, our financial performance depends significantly on the stability and growth of the residential construction market. This market depends on a variety of factors beyond our control, including household formation, consumer confidence, interest rates, inflation and the availability of mortgage financing, as well as the mix between single and multifamily construction, availability of construction labor and ultimately the extent to which new construction leads to the development of raw land. Adverse conditions or sustained uncertainty regarding the residential construction market could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows, including the risk that one or more of our distributors and/or end use customers decide to delay purchasing, or determine not to purchase, our products or services.\nOur business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.\nA majority of our products are sold primarily to distributors and our success depends on these outside parties operating their businesses profitably and effectively. These distributors\u2019 profitability and effectiveness can vary significantly from company to company and from region to region within the same company. Further, our largest distributors generally also carry competing products. We may fail to align our operations with successful distributors in any given market.\nDistributors in our industry have experienced consolidation in recent years. If such consolidation continues, our distributors could be acquired by other distributors who have better relationships with our competitors, and consequently,\npricing and profit margin pressure may intensify. Pricing and profit margin pressure or the loss of any one of our key distributors in any market could adversely affect our operating results.\nCertain products and solutions, primarily technology-enabled products and solutions, are sold directly to end users. Some of these customers represent a relatively high concentration of sales. Over time, expected growth in sales is expected to lessen the significance of individual customers. In the short term, net sales could decline if existing significant customers do not continue to purchase our products or services and new customers are not obtained to replace them.\nStrong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe United States and Canadian markets for water infrastructure and flow control products are very competitive. While there are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings, many of our competitors are well-established companies with strong brand recognition. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including the quality, price and innovation of our products, services and service levels. Our ability to retain customers in the face of competition depends on our ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively.\nThe United States markets for water metering products and systems are highly competitive. Our primary competitors benefit from strong market positions and many end users are slow to transition to new products or new brands. Our ability to attract new customers depends on our technological advancements and ability to market our products and services to our customers and end users effectively.\nIn addition to competition from North American companies, we face the threat of competition from outside of North America. The intensity of competition from these companies is affected by fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign local currencies, the cost to ship competitive products into North America and the availability of trade remedies, if any. Competition may also increase as a result of competitors located in the United States shifting their operations to lower-cost countries or otherwise reducing their costs.\nOur competitors may reduce the prices of their products or services, improve their quality, improve their functionality or enhance their marketing or sales activities. Any of these potential developments could adversely affect our prices and demand for our products and services.\nThe long-term success of our newer systems and solutions, including the related products, software and services, such as smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment, depends on market acceptance.\nOur technology-enabled smart metering, leak detection, pressure monitoring and pipe condition assessment products and services have much less market history than many of our traditional products. Our investments in smart metering have primarily focused on the market for AMI and have been based on our belief that water utilities will transition over time from traditional manually-read meters to automatically-read meters. The market for AMI is relatively new and continues to evolve, and the United States markets for water meter products and systems are highly competitive. Water utilities have traditionally been slow adopters of new technology and may not adopt AMI as quickly as we expect, partially as a result of the substantial investment related to installation of AMI systems. The strong market positions of our primary competitors may also slow the adoption of our products. Similarly, the adoption of our pressure monitoring, leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in new product and service offerings, and the pace of adoption may be slower than we expect. If the market for our technology-enabled products and services develops more slowly than we expect or these products and services fail to gain market acceptance, our opportunity to grow these businesses will be limited.\nRisks related to our business strategy\nWe may not be able to adequately manage the risks associated with the introduction and deployment of new products and systems, including increased warranty costs.\nThe success of our new products and systems, such as our recently launched smart hydrant and Sentryx software platform, will depend on our ability to manage the risks associated with their introduction, including the risk that new products and systems may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in their early stages that result in their failure to satisfy performance or reliability requirements. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage these risks, including costs associated with manufacturing, installation, maintenance and warranties. These challenges can be costly and technologically challenging, and we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect they may have. Warranty liabilities and the related reserve estimation process is highly judgmental as a result of the complex nature of these exposures and the unique circumstances of each claim. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for an alleged product defect by municipalities or other customers, it can be difficult to determine the level of potential exposure or liability related to such allegation to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. Although we have obtained insurance for product liability claims, such policies may not be available or adequate to cover the liability for damages, the cost of repairs and/or the expense of litigation. Current and future claims may arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. Failure to successfully manage these challenges could result in lost revenue, significant expense, and harm to our reputation.\nInefficient or ineffective allocation of capital, along with increased capital expenditure levels to modernize our aging facilities and expand our capabilities, could adversely affect our operating results and/or stockholder value, including negatively impacting our available cash reserves and prevent acquisition or other cash-intensive opportunities.\nOur goal is to invest capital to generate long-term value for our stockholders. This includes spending on capital projects, such as developing or acquiring strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhancing our existing set of product and service offerings, or entering into new markets, as well as periodically returning value to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. For example, we have completed the construction of our large valve manufacturing expansion in Chattanooga, Tennessee and made an additional investment in a facility in Kimball, Tennessee to further expand our capabilities in the area and allow us to insource more products and operations. We also expect to make significant progress in fiscal 2022 on the construction of our new brass manufacturing facility in Decatur, Illinois, which we expect to be completed in 2023. To a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage key risks. The actions taken to address specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. If we do not allocate properly and manage our capital, we may fail to produce expected financial results, and we may experience a reduction in stockholder value, including increased volatility in our stock price.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic reorganization plans.\nIn fiscal 2019, we relocated our research and development activities from our Middleborough, Massachusetts facility to Atlanta, Georgia, which consolidated our resources and should accelerate product innovation through creation of a research and development center of excellence for software and electronics in Atlanta.\nBetween November 2019 and March 2021, we announced the purchase and closure of several facilities. We purchased a new facility in Kimball, Tennessee, to support and enhance our investment in our Chattanooga, Tennessee large casting foundry. As a result of this reorganization, we closed our facilities in Hammond, Indiana and Woodland, Washington. We also announced the planned closures of our facilities in Aurora, Illinois and Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. Most of the activities from these plants will be transferred to our Kimball, Tennessee facility. We expect to substantially complete these facility closures by the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and expect to incur total expenses related to this restructuring of approximately $14.0 million. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the restructuring and reorganization activities will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings, if any.\nOur business strategy includes developing, acquiring and investing in companies and technologies that broaden our product portfolio or complement our existing business, which could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our long-term business strategy, we continue to evaluate the development or acquisition of strategic businesses, technologies and product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, enhance and expand our existing set of product and service offerings, or enter new markets. We may be unable to identify or successfully complete suitable acquisitions in the future and completed acquisitions may not be successful.\nAcquisitions and technology investments may involve significant cash expenditures, the incurrence of debt, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These types of transactions involve numerous other risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Diversion of management time and attention from existing operations,\n\u2022Difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business or into our compliance and control programs, particularly those that include international operations,\n\u2022Working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority (our interests and other ownership interests may be inconsistent),\n\u2022Difficulties in obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business or technology prior to the consummation of the transaction, including the identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances, including those relating to intellectual property claims, that could result in litigation or regulatory exposure,\n\u2022Assumptions of liabilities that exceed our estimated amounts,\n\u2022Verifying the financial statements and other business information of an acquired business,\n\u2022Inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms,\n\u2022Potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships or customers of the acquired company,\n\u2022Increased operating expenses related to the acquired businesses or technologies,\n\u2022The failure of new technologies, products or services to gain market acceptance with acceptable profit margins,\n\u2022Entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or in which competitors may have stronger market positions,\n\u2022Dilution of stockholder value through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities, and\n\u2022Inability to achieve expected synergies or the achievement of such synergies taking longer than expected to realize, including increases in revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits ultimately may be smaller than we expected.\nAny acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition, as they may not be successful and may ultimately have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition and/or result in impairment charges.\nPotential international business opportunities may expose us to additional risks, including currency exchange fluctuations.\nA part of our growth strategy depends on us expanding internationally. Although sales outside of the United States and Canada account for a relatively small percentage of our total net sales, we expect to increase our level of business activity outside of the United States and Canada, as illustrated by our December 2018 acquisition of Krausz Industries, which is based in Israel, and our acquisition in June 2021 of i2O Water Ltd, which is based in Southampton, United Kingdom. Some countries that present potential good business opportunities also face political and economic instability and vulnerability to infrastructure and other disruptions. Seeking to expand our business internationally exposes us to additional risks, which include foreign exchange risks and currency fluctuations, as discussed more fully below, political and economic uncertainties, changes in local business conditions and national and international conflicts. A primary risk we face in connection with our export shipments relates to our ability to collect amounts due from customers. We also face the potential risks arising from staffing, monitoring and managing international operations, including the risk such activities may divert our resources and management time.\nIn addition, compliance with the laws, regulations and taxes of multiple international jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business. International operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and anti-competition regulations, among others. For example, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside of the United States generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials and certain others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil sanctions, disrupt our business and adversely affect our brands, international expansion efforts, business and operating results.\nWe earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of United States dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the United States dollars we receive from revenues denominated in a foreign currency. Changes between a foreign exchange rate and the United States dollar affect the amounts we record for our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and could have a negative effect on our financial results. We expect that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow as the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases through both organic and inorganic growth.\nRisks related to our operations\nOur reliance on vendors for certain products, some of which are single-source or limited source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, reliability or cost.\nWe maintain several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships with manufacturers, including some outside of the United States. If the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related products in desired quantities or in a timely manner. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of profits, which could harm our operating results.\nThese relationships reduce our direct control over production. Our reliance on these vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages, and reduced control over delivery schedules of products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product costs. In instances where we stock lower levels of product inventories, a disruption in product availability could harm our financial performance and our ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective products from these manufacturers could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation.\nA disruption in our supply chain or other factors impacting the distribution of our products could adversely affect our business.\nA disruption within our logistics or supply chain network at any of the freight companies that deliver components for our manufacturing operations in the United States or ship our fully-assembled products to our customers could adversely affect our business and result in lost sales and increased expenses or harm to our reputation. Our supply chain is dependent on third party ocean-going container ships, rail, barge and trucking systems and, therefore, disruption in these logistics services because of weather-related problems, strikes, bankruptcies or other events could adversely affect our financial performance and financial condition, negatively impacting sales, profitability and cash flows.\nSeasonal demand for certain of our products and services may adversely affect our financial results.\nSales of some of our products, including iron gate valves and fire hydrants, are seasonal, with lower sales in our first and second fiscal quarters when weather conditions throughout most of North America tend to be cold resulting in lower levels of construction activity. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in our sales and operating results. To satisfy demand during expected peak periods, we may incur costs associated with building inventory in off-peak periods, and our projections as to future needs may not be accurate. Because many of our expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in our profitability and profit margins and deterioration of our financial condition during periods affected by lower production or sales activity.\nTransportation costs are relatively high for most of our products.\nTransportation costs can be an important factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Many of our products are big, bulky and heavy, which tend to increase transportation costs. We also have relatively few manufacturing sites, which tends to increase transportation distances to our customers and consequently increases our transportation costs. High transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors.\nOur high fixed costs may make it more difficult for us to respond to economic cycles.\nA significant portion of our cost structure is fixed, including manufacturing overhead, capital equipment and research and development costs. In a prolonged economic downturn, these fixed costs may cause our gross margins to erode and our earnings to decline.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing upgrades to our enterprise resource planning system.\nWe continue to be engaged in a multi-year implementation of upgrades to our enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d) and other systems. The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the company\u2019s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the Company\u2019s management team. These upgrades will require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP upgrade, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP upgrades could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.\nNormal operations at our key manufacturing facilities may be interrupted.\nSome of our key products, including fire hydrants and iron gate valves, are manufactured at a single facility or few manufacturing facilities, that depend on critical pieces of heavy equipment that cannot be moved economically to other locations. We are therefore limited in our ability to shift production among locations. The operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, explosions, natural disasters, severe weather or other similar occurrences,\n\u2022Terrorist attacks, war, mass shootings or other acts of violence,\n\u2022Interruptions in the delivery of raw materials, shortages of equipment or spare parts, or other manufacturing inputs,\n\u2022Adverse government regulations,\n\u2022Equipment or information systems breakdowns or failures,\n\u2022Violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits,\n\u2022Releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water,\n\u2022Labor disputes, and\n\u2022Cyberattacks and events.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows.\nAny inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur business depends on our technology and expertise, which were largely developed internally and are not subject to statutory protection. We rely on a combination of patent protection, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets protection, employee and third-party confidentiality agreements as well as technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. The measures that we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not adequately deter infringement, misappropriation or independent development of our technology, and they may not prevent an unauthorized party from obtaining or using information or intellectual property that we regard as proprietary or keep others from using brand names similar to our own. The disclosure, misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position. In addition, our actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and other resources. We may also be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from time to time, which may result in additional expenses and the diversion of resources to respond to these claims. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired the product is further subjected to competition. Products under patent protection potentially generate significantly higher revenue and earnings than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents, our competitive position could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not successfully maintain our information and technology networks, including the security of those networks, our operations could be disrupted and unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues could result.\nWe rely on various information technology systems, some of which are controlled by outside service providers, to manage key aspects of our operations. The proper functioning of our information technology systems is important to the successful operation of our business. If critical information technology systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to manufacture products, process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses and otherwise manage our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the Internet and our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and among our personnel and suppliers and customers. Cyber and other data security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we or our service providers are unable to prevent these breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial, reputational or other harm because of lost or misappropriated information.\nWe may fail to effectively manage confidential data, which could harm our reputation, result in substantial additional costs and subject us to litigation.\nAs we grow our technology-enabled products, services and solutions, we continue to accumulate increasing volumes of customer data. In addition, we store personal information in connection with our human resources operations. Our efforts to protect this information may be unsuccessful as a result of employee errors or malfeasance, technical malfunctions, the actions of third parties such as a cyberattack or other factors. If our cyber defenses and other countermeasures are unable to protect personal data, it could be accessed or disclosed improperly, which could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services. The regulatory environment related to cyber and information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, unauthorized access to customer data, or harm to our reputation.\nCybersecurity threats are constantly evolving and can take a variety of forms, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our information technology systems. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, radio communication protocols, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services. Additionally, these actors may reverse engineer trade secrets or other confidential intellectual property, or gain access to our networks and data centers, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, deny or postpone access to critical water infrastructure telemetry through vulnerabilities in our cloud services and infrastructure, or logging, sensing, and telemetry products. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data.\nWe may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cybersecurity threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nMisuse of our technology-enabled products, services and solutions could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation.\nAs we continue to design and develop products, services and solutions that leverage our hosted or cloud-based resources, the internet-of-things and other wireless/remote technologies and include networks of distributed and interconnected devices that contain sensors, data transfers and other computing capabilities, our customers\u2019 data and systems may be subjected to harmful or illegal content or attacks, including potential cybersecurity threats. Additionally, we may not have adequately anticipated or precluded such cybersecurity threats through our product design or development. These products, services and solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which may not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security\ndefects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in compromised security. These vulnerabilities and security defects could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of information/data; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our products, services and solutions; and otherwise harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to a variety of claims, investigations and litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are subject to claims and lawsuits, including from time to time claims for damages related to product liability and warranties, investigations by governmental agencies, litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights and litigation related to employee matters and commercial disputes. We may also be subject to investigations, claims, litigation and other proceedings outside the ordinary course of business, such as the June 2021 mass shooting event in our Albertville, Alabama facility. Defending these lawsuits and becoming involved in these investigations may divert management\u2019s attention, and may cause us to incur significant expenses, even if there is no evidence that our systems or practices were the cause of the claim. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards, penalties or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. See \u201cItem 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,\u201d \u201cItem 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies\u201d and Note 17. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. Any failure to satisfy these laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with any environmental, health or safety requirements could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes or a cessation of operations at our facilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because these laws are complex, subject to change and may be applied retroactively, we cannot predict with certainty the extent of our future liabilities with respect to environmental, health and safety matters and whether they will be material.\nIn addition, certain statutes such as CERCLA may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on entities that generated waste, arranged for disposal of waste, transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites. All such \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d (\u201cPRP\u201d), or any one of them, including us, may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. As a result, we may be required to conduct investigations and perform remedial activities at current and former operating and manufacturing sites where we have been deemed, or in the future could be, named a PRP with respect to such environmental liabilities, any of which could require us to incur material costs. The final remediation costs of these environmental sites may exceed current estimated costs, and additional sites in the future may require material remediation expenses. If actual expenditures exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. See \u201cItem 1. BUSINESS - Regulatory and Environmental Matters,\u201d \u201cItem 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies\u201d and Note 17. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThere is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures as a result of increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Many of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide. Such climate change may impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Growing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses as a result of increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The impacts of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint or in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives, the results could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on successors to Tyco to indemnify us for certain liabilities and they may become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity.\nUnder the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to the August 1999 sale by Tyco of businesses which make up certain of the companies within Mueller Water Products, Inc., we are indemnified by certain Tyco entities (\u201cTyco Indemnitors\u201d) for all liabilities arising in connection with the operation of these businesses prior to their sale by Tyco, including with respect to products manufactured or sold prior to the closing of that transaction, as well as certain environmental liabilities. These indemnities survive indefinitely and are not subject to any dollar limits. In the past, Tyco Indemnitors have made substantial payments and assumed defense of claims in connection with these indemnification obligations. Tyco\u2019s indemnity does not cover liabilities to the extent caused by us or the operation of our businesses after August 1999, nor does it cover liabilities arising with respect to businesses or sites acquired after August 1999. Since 2007, Tyco has engaged in multiple corporate restructurings, split-offs and divestitures. The result of these transactions is that the assets of, and control over, Tyco Indemnitors has changed. Should any Tyco Indemnitor become financially unable or fail to comply with the terms of the indemnity, we may be responsible for such obligations or liabilities.\nRisks related to our human capital\nWe depend on qualified personnel and, if we are unable to retain or hire executive officers, key employees and skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to expand or maintain our business depends on our ability to hire, train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel, which could negatively impact our business.\nIf we are unable to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or we experience strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or higher than normal absenteeism, our business could suffer.\nMany of our employees at our manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on generally satisfactory terms, negotiations may be challenging as the Company must have a competitive cost structure in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could impact our financial position and results of operations. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our plants could impair our ability to supply products to our distributors and customers, which could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and expose us to customer claims.\nFurthermore, our ability to meet product delivery commitments and labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates,\n\u2022Unemployment levels,\n\u2022Health and other insurance costs,\n\u2022The impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits,\n\u2022Changing demographics, and\n\u2022Our reputation within the labor market.\nWe also compete with many other industries and businesses for most of our hourly production employees. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Further, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs.\nOur expenditures for pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted.\nWe provide pension benefits to certain current and former employees. To determine our future payment obligations under the plans, certain rates of return on the plans\u2019 assets, growth rates of certain costs and participant longevity have been estimated. The proportion of the assets held by our United States pension plan invested in fixed income securities, instead of equity securities, has decreased over historical levels. This shift in asset allocation has not resulted in a material change to our estimated rate of return on plan assets for this plan. Assumed discount rates, expected return on plan assets and participant longevity have significant effects on the amounts reported for the pension obligations and pension expense.\nThe funded status of our pension plans may also be influenced by regulatory requirements, which can change unexpectedly and impose higher costs if funding levels are below certain thresholds. We may increase contributions to our pension plans to avoid or reduce these higher costs.\nSignificant adverse changes in credit and capital markets or changes in investments could result in discount rates or actual rates of return on plan assets being materially lower than projected and require us to increase pension contributions in future years to meet funding level requirements. Increasing life spans for plan participants may increase the estimated benefit payments and increase the amounts reported for pension obligations, pension contributions and pension expense. If increased funding requirements are particularly significant and sustained, our overall liquidity could be materially reduced, which could cause us to reduce investments and capital expenditures, or restructure or refinance our debt, among other things.\nRisks related to our international operations\nAny failure to satisfy international trade laws and regulations or to otherwise comply with changes or other trade developments may adversely affect us.\nOur operations require importing and exporting goods and technology among countries on a regular basis. Thus, the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Trade laws and regulations are complex, differ by country, and are enforced by a variety of government agencies. Because we are subject to extensive trade laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a manner that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities, and our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate international trade laws and regulations. For example, certain federal legislation requires the use of American iron and steel products in certain water projects receiving certain federal appropriations. We have incurred costs in connection with ensuring our ability to certify to these requirements, including those associated with enhancing our assembly operations and sourcing practices. As a result of the varying legal and regulatory requirements to which our cross-border activities are subject, we may not always be in compliance with the trade laws and regulations in all respects. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, including denial of import or export privileges, and could harm our reputation and our business prospects.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our revenue and results of operations may be harmed.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions continue to be placed on foreign imports by the United States and related countermeasures are taken by impacted foreign countries, our revenue and results of operations may be harmed. For example, trade tensions between the United States and China have led to series of significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories over recent years. The materials subject to these tariffs could impact our raw material costs as well. However, if further tariffs are imposed on a broader range of imports, or if further retaliatory trade measures are taken by China or other countries in response to additional tariffs, we may be required to raise our prices or incur additional expenses, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance, revenue and profit.\nThe prices of our purchased components and raw materials can be volatile.\nOur operations require substantial amounts of purchased components and raw materials, such as scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe. The cost and availability of these materials are subject to economic forces largely beyond our control, including North American and international demand, foreign currency exchange rates, freight costs, tariffs and commodity speculation and other external factors beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other supply chain challenges. Temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials have occurred in fiscal 2021, which have led to increased raw material price volatility which may continue into fiscal 2022.\nWe may not be able to pass on the entire cost of price increases, or at all, for purchased components and raw materials to our customers or offset fully the effects of these higher costs through productivity improvements. In particular, when purchased\ncomponent or raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than normal levels, we may not be able to pass cost increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which would reduce our profitability and cash flows. In addition, if purchased components or raw materials are not available or not available on commercially reasonable terms, our sales, profitability and cash flows would be reduced. Our competitors may secure more reliable sources of purchased components and raw materials or they may obtain these supplies on more favorable terms than we do, which could give them a cost advantage.\nOther risks related to our business\nThe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations may increase\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have meaningful adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations as discussed in PART II, \u201cItem 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\u201d As the impact of the pandemic continues, we may continue to experience additional plant closures, limitations in the ways we operate within our facilities, illness or quarantine of our employees, supply chain disruptions, transportation delays, cost increases, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities, or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas. These same factors may continue to impact our suppliers, customers and distributors and the severity of such impacts could increase. The health implications of the pandemic are extensive and the extent, duration and severity of the pandemic remain highly uncertain. We are unable to estimate the impact of measures we have taken thus far, additional measures we may undertake in the future and the actions taken, or that will be taken, by governmental agencies. Should there be unexpected health implications for our employees, communities or others, we could face litigation or other claims and suffer damage to our reputation, brand and operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have incurred additional costs to address the pandemic as discussed in PART II, \u201cItem 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d, including costs associated with unfavorable volume variances, voluntary emergency paid leave, incentive payments for vaccinations, additional cleaning, disinfectants and sanitation materials for our employees and at our facilities. We expect to continue to incur such costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to the pandemic. The pandemic is causing disruptions in our supply chain that have caused and could result in further higher costs in the manufacture and delivery of our products. We expect these conditions to persist for the near term and may worsen until the pandemic abates. Further, we expect additional costs, added administrative burdens and other negative cost and operational impacts as a result of the United States\u2019 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) emergency temporary standard (the \u201cVaccine/Test Mandate\u201d) related to COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements.\nContinued disruptions in our markets and the global economy may cause us to have to assess impairments of our assets and cause us to incur and record non-cash impairment charges.\nManagement is focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our operations, which has required, and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across our business and may delay other strategic initiatives and large capital projects that are important to the business. Additionally, many of our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and consequently impair our ability to manage our business.\nThe extent to which the pandemic and the evolving regulatory environment impacts us will depend on a number of factors and developments that we are not able to predict or control, including, among others: the severity of the virus; the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions which could include limits on funding for our products or services; the health of and the effect on our workforce; and the potential effects on our internal controls including those over financial reporting and information technology as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that are applicable to our employees, including management. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms, it at all, and continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe Vaccine/Test Mandate, if implemented as initially enacted, will require us to ensure that all of our employees in the United States are fully vaccinated or, if not, are tested for COVID-19 on a weekly basis, which could be difficult and costly. As ordered via a stay by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, OSHA suspended the implementation of the Vaccine/Test Mandate so the outcome and timing of the implementation of the Vaccine/Test Mandate is presently unclear. We intend to implement the Vaccine/Test Mandate by the deadline set forth by the standard once the stay and suspension of the implementation of the Vaccine/Test Mandate are removed. Further, additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which we operate our business, and there could be potential conflict with actions by certain states that are in\nconflict with the Vaccine/Test Mandate, the impacts of which remain uncertain. With ongoing health, supply chain, shipping, employment and other pandemic-related shortages of materials and workers, it is possible that the Vaccine/Test Mandate could result in labor disruptions, employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs as well as have impacts on the broader employment market and supply chain, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues, costs, financial condition and results of operations and subject us to various employee claims as well as other related legal liability.\nThe pandemic may also impact third parties with which we do business, and each of their financial conditions, including their viability and ability to pay for our products and services; which could adversely impact us. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our operations and financial results depends on future developments and is highly uncertain. The situation is ever changing and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known.", "PERMNO": 91639, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "MWA"}
