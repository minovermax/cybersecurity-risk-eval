Additional risks not presently known to or understood by us may also negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nReduction in cash flow from operations in 2015 may limit our ability to make the desired level of investment in our businesses and may lead to liquidity issues.\nWhile we do not believe we are facing any immediate or near-term liquidity issues in light of our current cash position and projected borrowing capacity under our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement, we have experienced negative cash flows from operations in recent years. We have taken steps to address and correct the primary causes of the decline through the sale of the discontinued Portamedic, Heritage Labs and Hooper Holmes Services businesses. We used approximately $3.4 million of cash in operations in 2014. If the revenue growth in our Health and Wellness operations does not continue as expected, our cost reduction measures are not successful, or we are unable to maintain our current collection results, it could become difficult to adequately make needed investments in our businesses or to comply with our debt covenants and have sufficient eligible receivables to maintain borrowing capacity under our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nOur liquidity may be adversely affected by the terms of our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement.\nIf we need to borrow in the future under our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement, the amount available for borrowing may be less than the $10 million limit under this facility at any given time due to the manner in which the maximum available amount is calculated. We have an available borrowing base subject to reserves established at our lender's discretion of 85% of \"Eligible Receivables\" (as defined in the 2013 Loan and Security Agreement) up to $10 million under this facility. Eligible Receivables do not include certain receivables deemed ineligible by our lender. As of December 31, 2014, our lender applied a discretionary reserve of $0.5 million. Available borrowing capacity, net of this discretionary reserve, was $2.6 million based on Eligible Receivables as of December 31, 2014.\nThe 2013 Loan and Security Agreement contains various covenants, including financial covenants which require us to achieve a minimum EBITDA amount (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization). The lender recently waived the minimum EBITDA covenant for the twelve months ending March 31, 2015 and replaced it with minimum EBITDA covenants of negative $2.5 million for the six months ending June 30, 2015, negative $2.25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and negative $2.0 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2015. The discretionary reserve applied by our lender was also increased to $2.0 million. We continue to have limitations on the maximum amount of permitted capital expenditures for each fiscal year. Our failure to comply with or amend these financial covenants may limit or eliminate our borrowing capability under the terms of our 2013 Loan and Security Agreement, which could negatively impact our financial condition. There can be no guarantee that we will continue to comply with the covenants in the 2013 Loan and Security agreement.\nWeakness in the economy in general, or the financial health or performance of the healthcare industry and healthcare sponsors in particular, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe derive our revenues from customers in the healthcare industry, including healthcare sponsors. If the condition of the U.S. economy weakens in certain areas, such as an increase in unemployment rates, demand for biometric screenings may decline in the future, resulting in less business for our Company. If some of our healthcare customers fail or curtail operations in the healthcare industry, such failures or curtailments of operations would result in less business for our Company. Either event would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business results would be adversely affected if we were alleged or found to have violated certain regulatory requirements.\nOur business is subject to varying degrees of state and federal regulation. For example, our operations are subject to regulations regarding licensing (supervision of phlebotomists, the conduct of certain specimen draws, and requirements for conducting health screening fairs). We are subject to federal and state laws, including testing and collection regulations and HIPAA rules, regarding security and privacy of personal health information and other personal information. Although we devote substantial effort to comply with these regulatory requirements, there is a continuing risk that regulators may\nfind compliance violations, which could subject us to significant liability and/or damage our relationship with our customers.\nOur business results may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and deploy health professionals and other medical personnel.\nWe believe a key to growth in our Health and Wellness operations is maintaining and managing a large, national network of highly trained medical personnel who can meet our customers' needs in markets nationwide. Although many of our health professionals also work for competitors, our goal is to offer them equal or greater opportunities so that they will be available to provide services to our customers. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriate base of health professionals, it may limit our ability to maintain and/or grow our screening business.\nFuture claims arising from the sale of our business units (discontinued operations) could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf claims for which we may be liable arise related to our previous discontinued operations in the future, this may result in additional cost to us which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn January 28, 2015, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release, by and among our Company, Farmers New World Life Insurance Company and Portamedic, Inc., relating to a claim made by Farmers against each of Portamedic and our Company challenging the validity of charges for services billed to Farmers by certain examiners engaged by Portamedic and our Company dating back to 2010. Under the terms of the 2013 Asset Purchase Agreement between our Company and Piston Acquisition, Inc. (now known as Portamedic), a subsidiary of American Para Professional Systems, Inc., (\u201cPiston\u201d), we agreed to indemnify Piston in connection with the subject matter of the claim. We agreed to deduct a total of $400,000 from the remaining funds held back by Piston as security for our indemnification obligations in exchange for a full release of obligation in connection with the matter and have reduced the remaining Holdback Amounts for the settlement of this claim. In addition, we have reduced the receivable related to the remaining Holdback Amounts to the amount we believe will be collected. There cannot be any assurance that any remaining Holdback Amounts will be collected by us. We anticipate finalization of the remaining Holdback Amount in the first half of 2015.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a limited number of customers and a loss of some or all of the business of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMuch of our Health and Wellness business is derived through our relationships with our channel partners. Our three largest channel partners, combined, account for more than 50% of our consolidated revenue and accounts receivable balances. While we have agreements with each of our channel partners, the vast majority of the agreements do not provide for any specified minimum level of purchases of services from us. If one or more of our channel partners was to significantly reduce its purchases of biometric screening and other sample collection services from us, it could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. If this were to occur, we would face significant challenges in replacing the lost revenues.\nA number of circumstances could prompt the loss of one or more of our key customers or a substantial portion of its or their business. For example, if one of our customers were to be acquired by or merged into another company for whom we do not provide services, we could lose the acquired company\u2019s business. We could lose one or more significant customers if they perceive one or more of our competitors to be superior in price or quality and choose not to renew our contract.\nWe are dependent on Clinical Reference Laboratory, Inc. as our exclusive laboratory services provider. If CRL fails to perform adequately under the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement or we face difficulties in managing our relationship with CRL, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Limited Laboratory and Administrative Services Agreement (\"LLASA\") between the Company and CRL, which became effective August 31, 2014, CRL is the Company\u2019s exclusive provider, with certain limited exceptions, of laboratory testing and reporting services in support of the Company\u2019s Health and Wellness offerings. The LLASA has a term of 5 years and will automatically renew for an additional 5 year period unless sooner terminated. Our dependence on CRL makes our operations vulnerable to CRL\u2019s failure to perform adequately under our contract with them. In addition, the services that CRL renders to us are services that we are required to provide under contracts with our clients, and we are responsible for such performance and could be held accountable by the\nclient for any failure to perform. The LLASA has service level requirements of CRL and we perform ongoing oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our relationship with CRL. If CRL were to fail to provide the services that we require or expect, or fails to meet its contractual requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to serve our customers and/or subject us to regulatory or litigation risk. Such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot successfully implement, maintain and upgrade our information technology platforms so that we can meet customer requirements, the competitiveness of our businesses will suffer.\nThe speed and accuracy with which we make information available to our customers is critical. As a result, we are dependent on our information technology platforms and our ability to store, retrieve, process, manage and enable timely and secure customer access to the health-related and other data we gather on behalf of our customers. Disruption of the operation of our IT systems for any extended period of time, loss of stored data, programming errors or other system failures could cause customers to turn elsewhere to address their service needs. In addition, we must continue to enhance our IT systems, with potentially at substantial cost, as the need for service, product and technology requirements advances. In addition, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, and spamming could harm our business and results of operations.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health professionals or other personnel could result in claims against us and/or our incurring expenses to indemnify our clients.\nAllegations of negligent or improper actions by our health or other medical professionals could result in claims against us, require us to indemnify our clients for any harm they may suffer, or damage our reputation and relationships with important clients. Our clients rely on the accuracy of the medical data we gather on their behalf in connection with their insurance underwriting, interventional programs, patient treatment and other decisions. As a result, we face exposure to claims that may arise or result from the decisions of our customers based on allegedly inaccurate data or faulty analysis of such data. We maintain professional liability insurance and such other coverage as we believe appropriate, but such insurance may prove insufficient. Regardless of insurance, any such claims could damage our reputation and relationships with important clients.\nOur classification of most of our health professionals in many states as independent contractors, rather than employees, exposes us to possible litigation and legal liability.\nSome state agencies have claimed that we improperly classified our health professionals as independent contractors for purposes of state unemployment and/or workers compensation tax laws and that we were therefore liable for taxes in arrears, or for penalties for failure to comply with such state agencies\u2019 interpretations of the laws. In some states, our classification of health professionals has been upheld and in others it has not. However, there are no assurances that we will not be subject to similar claims in other states in the future, nor are there any assurances that those states which have previously upheld our position concerning the classification of our contractors will continue to do so in the future.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by the effects of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism.\nOur operations would be adversely affected in the event of a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, or an act of terrorism. A natural disaster or act of terrorism could disrupt our ability to provide testing services, which could have a material adverse effect on our Health and Wellness operations.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could fail to accurately report our financial results, which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs previously reported, during management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, management determined that there was a material weakness in our controls as a result of turnover of personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge associated with the sale of the Portamedic business and strategic relocation and transition of the corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Olathe, Kansas. These factors adversely affected management\u2019s review of the accounting for non-routine, complex technical accounting matters to ensure proper application of generally accepted accounting principles in a timely manner, as well as its timely identification of certain transactions subject to reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. As of December 31, 2014, management concluded that the 2013 material weakness had been remediated.\nIt is possible that other material weaknesses and/or control deficiencies could be identified by our management in the future, or may occur without being identified. The existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate such weakness or deficiency and management may not be able to remediate the same in a timely manner. Any such weakness or deficiency, even if remediated quickly, could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition, reduce the market value of our common stock and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 42455, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "HPHWQ"}
