{"cik": "1493594", "company": "MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-11-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report in evaluating the Company and its common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur revenue growth and gross margin are substantially dependent on our successful development and release of new products.\nMaintaining or growing our revenue will depend on our ability to timely develop new products for existing and new markets that meet customers\u2019 performance, reliability and price expectations. In addition, the average selling prices of our products are expected to decrease over time and we must introduce new products that can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance to offset this expected price erosion. If we are not able to repeatedly introduce, in successive years, new products that ship in volume, our revenue will likely not grow and may decline significantly and rapidly. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we have in the past and may in the future experience delays and failures in completing the development and introduction of new products. Our successful product development depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe accurate prediction of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified product designers and process technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to design products that meet customers\u2019 cost, size and performance requirements and other technical specifications;\n\u2022\nour ability to design and manufacture new products in volume with acceptable manufacturing yields, and deliver them to customers in time for the applicable market adoption window;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer new products at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance by customers of our new product designs;\n\u2022\nthe identification of and timely entry into new markets for our products;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of our customers\u2019 products by the market and the lifecycle of such products;\n\u2022\nour ability to innovate, the strength of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, on commercially reasonable terms, licenses to necessary third party intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and increase our level of product content in our customers\u2019 systems.\nA new product design effort may last twelve to eighteen months or longer, and requires significant investment in engineering hours and materials, as well as sales and marketing expenses, which may not be recouped if the product launch is unsuccessful. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the delay or cancellation of a platform for which any of our semiconductor solutions is designed, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint, obsolete and otherwise unmarketable. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts could result in decreased revenue and our competitors obtaining design wins. We may be unable to design, introduce, manufacture or deliver new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may fail to meet the requirements of the market or our customers, or may be adopted by customers more slowly than we expect. In that case, our gross margin may decrease, we may not reach our expected level of production orders and we may lose market share, which could adversely affect our ability to sustain our revenue growth or maintain our current revenue levels.\nUnderutilization, price competition, acquisitions and various other factors may reduce our gross margin, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to utilize our design, fabrication, assembly and test facilities at a high level, the significant fixed costs associated with these facilities may not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher than average unit costs and lower gross margin. Similarly, when we compete for business on the basis of our products\u2019 unit price, the average selling price of our products is reduced, negatively affecting our gross margins. We have in the past and may in the future acquire businesses with lower-margin products that reduce our overall gross margins. Our various products have different gross margins. Increased sales of lower-margin products, such as certain of our more mature products, in a given period relative to sales of higher-margin products, may cause us to report lower overall gross margin. In addition, increased raw material costs, changes in manufacturing yields, more complex engineering requirements and certain other factors can reduce our gross margins from time to time. We have experienced periods where our gross margin declined due to these and other factors, and expect these factors will have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations from time to time in the future. As a result of these or other factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our gross margin in future periods and our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We may not meet investors\u2019 quarterly or annual financial expectations and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and related expectations may vary significantly in the future based upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that could cause operating results and related expectations to fluctuate include:\n\u25aa\nthe general economic growth or decline in the U.S. or foreign markets;\n\u25aa\nthe reduction or cancellation of orders by customers, whether as a result of a loss of market share by us or our customers, changes in the design of customers\u2019 products or slowing demand for our products or customers\u2019 products;\n\u25aa\nthe amount of new customer orders we book and ship in any particular fiscal quarter, which accounts for a material amount of our net revenue in any particular quarter, and which can often be weighted toward the latter part of each fiscal quarter, making the timing of recognition of the associated revenue difficult to forecast and susceptible to slippage between quarters;\n\u25aa\nthe relative linearity of our shipments within any particular fiscal quarter, in that a less linear shipment pattern within a given fiscal quarter tends to result in lower gross margin in that quarter and a shipment pattern weighted toward the latter part of a fiscal quarter tends to reduce our cash flows from operations in that quarter, as collections of related receivables do not occur until later fiscal periods;\n\u25aa\nthe gain or loss of a key customer or significant changes in demand from or the financial condition of one or more key customers;\n\u25aa\nfluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers, as well as their ability to manage the inventory that they hold and to forecast accurately their demand for our products;\n\u25aa\nthe fluctuations in manufacturing output, yields, capacity levels, quality control or other potential problems or delays we or our subcontractors may experience in the fabrication, assembly, testing or delivery of our products;\n\u25aa\nthe fluctuations in demand relating to the I&D market due to changes in government programs, budgets or procurement;\n\u25aa\nthe market acceptance of our products and particularly the timing and success of new product and technology introductions by us, customers or competitors;\n\u25aa\nour ability to predict market requirements and evolving industry standards accurately and in a timely manner;\n\u25aa\nthe amount, timing and relative success of our investments in research and development, which impacts our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and solutions on a timely basis;\n\u25aa\nthe period-to-period changes in the mix of products we sell, which can result in lower gross margin;\n\u25aa\nthe availability, quality and cost of semiconductor wafers and other raw materials, equipment, components and internal or outsourced manufacturing, packaging and test capacity, particularly where we have only one qualified source of supply;\n\u25aa\nthe effects of seasonal and other changes in customer demand;\n\u25aa\nthe effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\n\u25aa\nthe effects of impairment charges associated with intangible assets, including goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets;\n\u25aa\nthe loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;\n\u25aa\nthe effects of factors that could cause our reported domestic and foreign income taxes and income tax rate to increase in future periods, such as limits on our ability to utilize net operating losses or tax credits and the geographic distribution of our income, which may change from period to period;\n\u25aa\nthe exposure of our operations to possible capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, as well as political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes;\n\u25aa\nfurther clarifications and/or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, trade policies or changes in laws and regulations, in the U.S. and other countries; and\n\u25aa\nthe effects of war, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, macroeconomic uncertainty or decline or geopolitical unrest.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual operating results and related expectations for future periods. If our operating results in any period do not meet our publicly stated guidance or the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price may decline. Similarly, any publicly stated guidance we provide in the future may fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts and our stock price may decline and has, in the past, declined as a result.\nIf demand for our products in our primary markets declines or fails to grow, our revenue and profitability may suffer.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to anticipate demand and respond to that demand with products that address our customers' needs. To a significant extent, this growth depends on the continued growth in usage of advanced electronic systems in our primary markets: Telecom, Data Center and I&D generally, and in the optical networks market in particular, which accounted for 18.5% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019. The rate and extent to which these markets will grow, if at all, is uncertain. For example, we anticipate significant growth in the demand for our products in Cloud Data Centers, and have focused significant internal resources to meet that anticipated demand. Our ability to capitalize on this and our other previously announced market opportunities in 100G optical networks and GaN technology will depend on, among other things, the future size and growth rates of these markets, the next generation technologies selected by customers, the timing of network upgrades in these markets and the future pace of adoption of our products in these markets. Our markets may fail to grow or decline for many reasons, including macro-economic factors, insufficient consumer demand, technological hurdles, research and development delays, lack of access to capital, sequestration or other changes in the U.S. defense budget and procurement processes and changes in export controls or other regulatory environments. Even if our primary markets grow, demand for our products in those markets may fail to grow in the event that they fail to embrace next-generation technologies we offer such as GaN-on-Silicon and etched facet lasers, or adopt technologies other than those we offer or implement changes in network specifications that our products do not adequately address. For instance, if demand for our products targeting 10 Gigabit PON or Cloud Data Center deployments is lower or slower to materialize than we anticipate, or we fail to deliver a portfolio of 10 Gigabit PON or Cloud Data Center products that meets the full set of solution requirements our customers demand within the requisite market window, our revenues could fail to grow or decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected. If demand for electronic systems that incorporate our products declines, fails to grow or grows more slowly than we anticipate, purchases of our products may be reduced, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A failure to predict demand or respond to demand with successful products in timely fashion will materially affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe typically depend on orders from a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019, no direct customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue and sales to our top 10 direct and distribution customers accounted for an aggregate of 53.6% of our revenue. While the composition of our top 10 customers varies from year to year, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of\nour revenue for the foreseeable future. The purchasing arrangements with our customers are typically conducted on a purchase order basis that does not require our customers to purchase any minimum amount of our products over a period of time. As a result, it is possible that any of our major customers could terminate their purchasing arrangements with us with little or no warning and without penalty, or significantly reduce or delay the amount of our products that they order, purchase products from our competitors or develop their own products internally. The loss of, or a reduction in, orders from any major customer may cause a material decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks from our international sales and operations.\nWe have operations in Europe and Asia, and customers around the world. As a result, we are subject to regulatory, geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Global operations involve inherent risks, including currency controls, currency exchange rate fluctuations, new or potential international trade agreements, tariffs, required import and export licenses, associated delays and other related international trade restrictions and regulations. Further, there is a risk that language barriers, cultural differences and other factors associated with our international operations may make them more difficult to manage effectively.\nThe legal system in many of the regions where we conduct business can lack transparency in certain respects relative to that of the U.S. and can accord local government authorities a higher degree of control and discretion over business than is customary in the U.S. This makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and maintaining compliance inherently more difficult and unpredictable. In addition, the protection accorded to proprietary technology and know-how under these legal systems may not be as strong as in the U.S., and, as a result, we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantages. The cost of doing business in European jurisdictions can also be higher than in the U.S. due to exchange rates, local collective bargaining regimes and local legal requirements and norms regarding employee benefits and employer-employee relations, in particular. We are also subject to U.S. legal requirements related to our foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Sales to customers located outside the U.S. accounted for 52.1% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019.\nSales to customers located in China and the Asia Pacific region typically account for a substantial majority of our overall sales to customers located outside the U.S. We expect that revenue from international sales generally, and sales to China and the Asia Pacific region specifically, will continue to be a material part of our total revenue. Therefore, any financial crisis, trade war or dispute or other major event causing business disruption in international jurisdictions generally, and China and the Asia Pacific region in particular, could negatively affect our future revenues and results of operations. For example, in 2016 the BIS temporarily blocked exports of U.S. products to Chinese telecommunications OEM Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment Corporation (\"ZTE\"). More recently, in April 2018, the BIS again blocked exports of U.S. products to ZTE, which were lifted in July 2018. ZTE is under a court-ordered monitorship, which means that if it does not comply with certain requirements similar export control prohibitions could be imposed again. Also, in August 2018, the BIS blocked exports of U.S. products to certain Chinese aerospace customers. More recently, in January 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal charges against Huawei including, but not limited to, attempts theft of trade secrets, wire fraud and violations of U.S. sanctions related to Iran. On May 16, 2019, the BIS added Huawei and many of its affiliates to the Entity list, which effectively blocks exports of U.S. products to Huawei and the affiliates. A U.S. ban on exports to one or more large OEM customers could materially reduce our revenue and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. Unlike other types of U.S. government sanctions, the Huawei Entity list prohibitions do not apply to the shipment from outside the United States of certain foreign-made items that are not within the jurisdiction of the export control regulations. We believe that a small number of our foreign-made products are not within the scope of the Entity List prohibitions and we have resumed shipments of them to Huawei from outside the United States. If the U.S. Government is uncertain about whether such items were not subject to U.S. export controls, it could conduct an investigation and, if it is determined that some of the items were subject to U.S. export control jurisdiction, result in costs, fines or penalties that could have a material impact on our business.\nBecause the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our products become less price-competitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the U.S. dollar. Also, we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If they do not, our reported revenue and earnings will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. Some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from U.S. laws. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements and to collect amounts owed to us.\nThe majority of our assembly, packaging and test vendors are located in Asia. We generally do business with our foreign assemblers in U.S. dollars. Our manufacturing costs could increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the U.S. dollar. Also, our international manufacturing suppliers may not continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If they do not, our costs will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations. From time to time, we may attempt to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk by buying currency contracts or otherwise, and any such efforts involve expense and associated risk that the currencies involved may not behave as we expect and we may lose money on such hedging strategies or not properly hedge our risk.\nIn addition, if terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil, economic or military unrest, natural disasters, embargoes or other economic sanctions, enforcement actions against governments, governmental entities or private entities or political instability occurs in the U.S. or other locations, such events may disrupt our manufacturing, assembly, logistics, security and communications, and could also result in reduced demand for our products. We have in the past and, may again in the future, experience difficulties relating to employees traveling\nin and out of countries facing civil unrest or political instability and with obtaining travel visas for our employees. Major health pandemics could also adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns. We could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers. There can be no assurance that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nChanges in U.S. and international laws, accounting standards, export and import controls and trade policies or the enforcement of, or attempt to enforce, such laws, standards, controls and policies, particularly with regard to China, may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur future results could be adversely affected by changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or changes in laws and regulations, including, among others, changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, trade laws, import and export restrictions, privacy laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries.\nThe U.S. government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that have led to, and may lead to further, changes to U.S. and international export and import controls or trade policies, including recently-imposed tariffs affecting certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, including China. In response, many of those trading partners, including China, have imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on American products. It is unknown whether and to what extent new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on us or our industry and customers. Any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as export and import controls, capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for our products and services, increase the cost of components, delay production, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. If any new export or import controls, tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations. In addition, proceedings to enforce, or the enforcement of, any laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. or other countries, and the resulting response to such actions, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment in technology as well as research and development may not be successful, which may impact our profitability.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in technology as well as research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. Research and development expenses were $163.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019. In each of the last three fiscal years, we invested in research and development as part of our strategy toward the development of innovative products and solutions to fuel our growth and profitability. We cannot assure you if, or when, the products and solutions where we have focused our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive or succeed in our strategy. Our efforts to develop new and improved process technologies for use in our products require substantial expenditures that may not generate any return on investment, may take longer than we anticipate to generate a return or may generate a return on investment that is inadequate. Following our Nitronex Acquisition, we announced a number of strategic plans and positive expectations concerning the future cost structure, manufacturability, opportunity for strategic partnerships and licensing programs, market applicability and potential positive impact on our market share of GaN-on-Silicon technology, which is a focus of the Nitronex business. We have in the past and continue to experience unexpected difficulties, expenses or delays in qualifying our GaN-on-Silicon process technology either internally or at one or more third party foundries and qualifying related products with our customers, and we were engaged in a litigation with the former licensor of this technology as described elsewhere in this Annual Report. We may not be successful in process or product qualification, manufacturing cost reduction or marketing efforts related to GaN-on-Silicon, may not realize the competitive advantage we anticipate from related investments and may not realize customer demand for this technology that meets our expectations, any of which could lead to higher than expected operating expense, lower than expected revenue and gross margin, associated charges or otherwise reduce the price of our common stock. We also have undertaken significant research and development efforts aimed at new products targeting market segments where we see potential for growth including the wireless basestation and Cloud Data Center. We may not be successful in our research and development efforts or may not realize the competitive advantage, revenues or profits we anticipate from these new products, any of which may lead to higher research and development expense, lower than expected revenues and gross margin and reduced profitability, or may otherwise harm our business or reduce the price of our common stock. Such results, or anticipated results, may cause us to reevaluate our investment in those areas of our business. For example, in June 2019 we announced our plans to cease investing in the design and development of optical modules and subsystems for Data Center applications.\nWe may incur significant risk and expense in attempting to win new business and such efforts may never generate revenue.\nTo obtain new business, we often need to win a competitive selection process to develop semiconductors for use in our customers\u2019 systems, known in the industry as a \u201cdesign win\u201d. These competitive selection processes can be lengthy and can require us to incur significant and unreimbursed design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity, particularly when seeking to develop or introduce solutions in new markets. We may not win the competitive selection process or may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures and selling, general and administrative expenses. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from supplying components for an entire generation of a customer\u2019s system. This can result in lost or foregone revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes or cause us to fail to meet revenue projections or expectations.\nEven when we achieve a design win, success is not guaranteed. Customer qualification and design cycles can be lengthy, and it may take a year or more following a successful design win and product qualification for one of our products to be purchased in volume by the customer. We may experience difficulties manufacturing the part in volume, such as low yields, supply chain delays or shortages or quality issues. Further, while the customer has successfully qualified our part for use in its system, it may not have qualified all of the other components being sourced for its system, or qualified its system as a whole with its end customers. Any difficulties our customer may experience in completing those qualifications may delay or prevent us from translating the design win into revenue. These risks can be particularly acute in our I&D market, where we may spend material amounts and commit substantial design engineering resources to product development work in support of an OEM customer\u2019s attempt to win business tied to a government contract award, but realize no related revenue or less than expected revenue from our investment due to failure of the OEM customer to win the business, government program cancellation, federal budget limitations or otherwise. Any of these events or any cancellation of a customer\u2019s program or failure of our customer to market its own product successfully after our design win, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. Our profitability will decline if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand when managing inventory.\nWe generally sell our products on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Our customers can typically cancel purchase orders or defer product shipments for some period without incurring a liability to us. We typically plan production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially, leading to excess inventory write-downs and resulting negative impacts on gross margin and net income. We have limited visibility into our customers\u2019 inventories, future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which could adversely affect our production forecasts and operating margins. The difficulty in predicting demand may be compounded when we sell to OEM customers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In a number of markets we serve, large dollar value customer orders scheduled for delivery in the current fiscal quarter may be canceled or rescheduled by the customer for delivery in a future fiscal quarter on short notice, which may cause our reported revenue to vary materially from our prior expectations. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. If we overestimate our customers\u2019 requirements, we may have excess inventory, which could lead to obsolete inventory and unexpected costs. Further, if we build inventory specific to non-recurring engineering (\"NRE\") arrangements that we may enter into with our customers from time to time and then fail to achieve one or more required milestones in connection with such NRE arrangements, we may have excess, non-qualified or non-conforming customer specific inventory, which could lead to unsellable inventory and unexpected costs. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers\u2019 requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could lead to foregone revenue opportunities, loss of potential market share and damage to customer relationships caused by late product deliveries disrupting our customers\u2019 production schedules. Some of our larger customers also require us to build and maintain minimum inventories and keep them available for purchase at specified locations based on non-binding demand estimates that are subject to change, which exposes us to increased inventory risk and makes it more difficult to manage our working capital. If demand from such customers decreases, we may be left with excess or obsolete inventory that we are unable to sell. In response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from outside suppliers and foundries, we periodically order materials and build a stock of finished goods inventory in advance of customer demand. This advance ordering of raw material and building of finished goods inventory has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail to materialize or other factors make our products less saleable. In addition, any significant future cancellation or deferral of product orders could adversely affect our revenue and margins, increase inventory write-downs due to obsolete inventory or adversely affect our operating results and stock price.\nThe average selling prices of our products may decrease over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin.\nIt is common in our industry for the average selling price of a given product to decrease over time as production volumes increase, competing products are developed, technology, industry standards and customer platforms evolve or new technologies featuring higher performance or lower cost emerge. We work to actively manage the prices of our existing products, increase our sales volumes and introduce new process technologies and products in the market that exhibit higher performance, new features that are in demand or lower\nmanufacturing costs. Despite this strategy, we expect to experience price erosion in future periods. Failure to maintain our current prices, to offset price reductions by increasing our sales volumes or to successfully execute on our new product development strategy may cause our revenue and gross margin to decline, which could decrease the value of your investment in our common stock.\nWe face intense competition in our industry, and our inability to compete successfully could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive. While we compete with a wide variety of companies, we compete with Broadcom across most of our primary markets. Our other significant competitors include, among others, NXP, Inphi, Maxlinear, Semtech, ADI, Microchip, Qorvo and Skyworks.\nWe believe future competition could also come from companies developing new alternative technologies, component suppliers based in countries with lower production costs and IC manufacturers achieving higher levels of integration that exceed the functionality offered by our products. Our customers and suppliers could also develop products that compete with or replace our products. A decision by any of our large customers to design and manufacture ICs internally could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Increased competition has in the past and could in the future lead to lower prices for our products, reduced demand for our products and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development, engineering and manufacturing costs.\nMany of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions, historical affiliations with original equipment manufacturers, considerable internal manufacturing capacity, established intellectual property rights, strong brand recognition and substantial technological capabilities. Many of them may also have greater financial, technical, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years. Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations. In addition, certain countries such as China have begun implementing initiatives to build domestic semiconductor supply chains and we may be at a disadvantage in attempting to compete with entities associated with such foreign government efforts based on their lower cost of capital, access to government largesse, preferential sourcing practices, stronger local relationships or otherwise. Prospective customers may decide not to buy from us due to concerns about our relative size, financial stability or other factors. Our failure to successfully compete could result in lower revenue, decreased profitability and a lower stock price.\nWe operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to significant downturns.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, product obsolescence, evolving standards, short product lifecycles and significant fluctuations in supply and demand. The industry has historically experienced significant fluctuations in demand and product obsolescence, resulting in product overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Downturns in this industry may be prolonged, and downturns in many sectors of the electronic systems industry have in the past contributed to extended periods of weak demand for semiconductor products. We have experienced decreases in our revenue, profitability, cash flows and stock price during such downturns in the past, and may be similarly harmed by future downturns, particularly if we are unable to effectively respond to reduced demand in a particular market.\nIf we are unable to further penetrate into and expand our share into strategic markets or accurately anticipate or react timely or properly to emerging trends, our revenues may not grow and could decline.\nOur primary markets, including the Cloud Data Center market, undergo transitions from time to time in which products incorporate new features, interoperability and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. If our products are unable to support the new features or standards required by OEMs or end customers in these markets, or if our products fail to be certified or adopted by OEMs, we will lose business from existing or potential customers and may not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs. If we fail to develop products with required features or standards, we experience a delay in certifying or bringing a new product to market, or our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products, our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period. Many of our products targeting Cloud Data Center applications are relatively new or still in development. Even if we succeed in generating customer demand for such products, if we are unable to deliver the quantities required by customers on time and at the right price point, due to design challenges, manufacturing bottlenecks, supply shortages, manufacturing yield issues or otherwise, we may fail to secure or maintain business and our revenues and gross and net margins could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may sell, wind down or exit one or more of our businesses or product lines, from time to time, as a result of our evaluation of our businesses, products and markets, and any such divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business.\nWe periodically evaluate our various businesses and product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture, wind down or exit of one or more of those businesses or product lines. For example, in August 2015, we sold our Automotive business based on our belief that it was not consistent with our long-term strategic vision from a growth and profitability perspective. In October 2017, we sold the Compute business that we had acquired through the AppliedMicro Acquisition, as the products were not complementary to our product portfolio and did not strategically align with our long-term focus. In May 2018, we sold certain capital equipment, inventory and other\nassets associated with our LR4 business that we had acquired through our December 2015 acquisition of FiBest. More recently, in June 2019 we decided to cease R&D activities related to new programs and wind down ongoing development activities for a certain product line.\nDivestitures have inherent risks, including the inability to find potential buyers with favorable terms, the expense of selling the product line, the possibility that any anticipated sale will be delayed or will not occur, the potential impact on our cash flows and results of operations, the potential delay or failure to realize the perceived strategic or financial merits of the divestment or receive milestone, earn-out, royalty or other post-closing payments, difficulties in the separation of operations, services, information technology, products and personnel, potential loss of customers or employees, exposure to unanticipated liabilities, unexpected costs associated with such separation, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and potential post-closing claims for alleged breaches of related agreements, indemnification or other disputes.\nThe product families we acquired in our AppliedMicro acquisition face challenges due to declining sales of older products and the evolving dynamics of the networking and communications industries.\nThe product families we added through our AppliedMicro acquisition face industry-specific challenges, in addition to the risks applicable to our business as a whole. For our connectivity products, order patterns historically have been uneven from period to period. The unpredictable nature of demand in this sector makes it more difficult to forecast our revenues, and may cause us to incur additional expenses for inventory that may need to be written off. Our connectivity product lines are also subject to technology transitions within the communications industry. For example, as the communications industry has continued to shift away from the synchronous optical network (\"SONET\")/synchronous data hierarchy standard to the higher speed, lower power optical transport network (\"OTN\") standard, substantially all of our new connectivity product designs utilize the OTN standard. However, as a result of this transition, many of our older, SONET-based connectivity products are experiencing declining sales, while our newer connectivity products, such as the X-Weave product family, have not yet generated significant revenue. Moreover, the transition to OTN, resulting in higher sales volumes and increased competition from integrated solutions providers, is in turn leading to price and margin erosion challenges. The introduction of other technological standards may also affect demand for our products. For our PowerPC product lines, as well, the migration of the networking industry away from products utilizing the PowerPC architecture and towards products utilizing other architectures such as ARM, has presented challenges. In line with this migration, we are no longer introducing new PowerPC product designs and are reducing our resources equipped to support our older PowerPC product lines. Moreover, many of our older, PowerPC-based computing products are experiencing declining sales. If we are unable to develop and deliver new products in other areas that meet changing customer and industry needs and generate sufficient revenue to offset the decline in sales of our older product lines, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to continue to keep pace with new or improved semiconductor process technologies could impair our competitive position.\nSemiconductor manufacturers constantly seek to develop new and improved semiconductor process technologies. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to gain access to these semiconductor process technologies, internally or externally, in order to adapt to emerging customer requirements and competitive market conditions. We may be unable to internally develop such technologies successfully and may be unable to gain access to them from merchant foundries or other sources on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to remain abreast of new and improved semiconductor process technologies as they emerge, we may lose market share and our revenue and gross margin may decline, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with export control regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges.\nCertain of our products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the BIS, which require that we obtain an export license before we can export products or technology to specified countries. Other products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person. U.S. regulators have announced \u201cexport control reform\u201d that has changed and is expected to change many of the rules applicable to us in this area in the future in ways we do not yet fully understand and we have experienced and will continue to experience challenges in complying with the new rules as they become effective, resulting in difficulties or an inability to ship products to certain countries and customers.\nWe are also subject to U.S. import regulations and the import and export regimes of other countries in which we operate. Failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the U.S. government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from government contracts. Export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries or customers altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach by regulators to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing regulations by regulators, specific sanctions by regulators or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could harm our business by resulting in decreased use of our products by or our decreased ability to export\nor sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. In addition, our sale of our products to or through third-party distributors, resellers and sales representatives creates the risk that any violation of these laws they may engage in may cause disruption in our markets or otherwise bring liability on us.\nWe may incur liabilities for claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our products.\nThe semiconductor industry is generally subject to frequent litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. For example, in 2018 we concluded legal action against Infineon Technologies Americas Corporation and Infineon Technologies AG (collectively, \"Infineon\") that had been pending in federal court and was brought to confirm and defend our exclusive rights to use certain patented GaN-on-Silicon technology developed by Nitronex in our core RF markets. Other companies in the industry have numerous patents that protect their intellectual property rights in these areas and technology is frequently licensed. In the past, we have been and may in the future be, subject to claims that we have breached infringed or misappropriated patent, license or other intellectual property rights. Our customers may assert claims against us for indemnification if they receive claims alleging that their or our products infringe upon others\u2019 intellectual property rights, and have in the past and may in the future choose not to purchase our products based on their concerns over such a pending claim. In the event of an adverse result of any intellectual property rights litigation, we could be required to incur significant costs to defend or settle such litigation, pay substantial damages for infringement, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, incur material liability for royalty payments or fees to obtain licenses to the technology covered by the litigation or be subjected to an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products, and materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Negotiated settlements resolving such claims may require us to pay substantial sums. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in any such non-infringing development or that any such license would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lost sales or damaged customer relationships and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe success of any strategic alliances may be subject to significant uncertainty, and we may be substantially reliant upon certain partner(s) for the commercial success of the opportunity.\nThe terms of any strategic alliances may subject us to significant uncertainty regarding the success of such transaction as we may be substantially reliant upon a partner for the technical and/or commercial success of the opportunity. In addition, any such transactions may also divert our financial resources and management\u2019s attention from other important areas of our business. Furthermore, any failure of a transaction to satisfy customer expectations could adversely impact our own relationships with such customers and/or the reputation of our brand. If a transaction does not progress according to our expectations or anticipated timing, our business could be adversely affected and our investment in such transactions may not be successful. If a transaction is not successful, or not as successful as anticipated, we may also never realize the full, or any, benefit of royalty, milestone and/or other payment terms included in the transaction and may be required to devote more management time and resources in connection with the conclusion of any such alliance.\nMany of our products currently incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. If the licenses to such technology that we currently hold become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, or if we are unable to acquire or license necessary technology for our products in the future, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with these markets at times depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions or at all and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers\u2019 products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share and our revenue and results of operations could materially decline. For instance, our connectivity business is a licensee of ARM Limited (\"ARM\") and Synopsys Inc. (\"Synopsys\") technology libraries, and continued license rights will depend upon our ability to successfully renew or otherwise maintain our license rights to those libraries, as well as the timely delivery by ARM and Synopsys of various updates and other support under their respective license agreements.\nIn addition, disputes with third party licensors over required payments, scope of licensed rights and compliance with contractual terms are common in our industry and we have in the past and may in the future be subjected to disputes over the terms of such licenses. Such disputes may require us to incur significant costs defending our license rights, divert management\u2019s attention or result in our inability to sell or develop certain products. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays in developing substitute technology to deliver competitive products, damaged customer and vendor relationships, indemnification liabilities and declining revenues and profitability. Such events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for products and services required for our business, which may limit our ability to meet customer demand, assure product quality and control costs.\nWe purchase numerous raw materials, such as ceramic packages, precious metals, semiconductor wafers and ICs, from a limited number of external suppliers. We also currently use several external manufacturing suppliers for assembly and testing of our products, and in some cases for fully-outsourced turnkey manufacturing of our products. We currently expect to increase our use of outsourced manufacturing in the future as a strategy. The ability and willingness of our external suppliers to perform is largely outside of our control. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components, the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity constraints, manufacturing yields, quality and fabrication costs and misappropriation of our intellectual property. If these vendors\u2019 processes vary in reliability or quality, they could negatively affect our products and, therefore, our customer relations and results of operations. We generally purchase raw materials on a purchase order basis and we do not have significant long-term supply commitments from our vendors. The long-term supply commitments we have may result in an obligation to purchase excess material, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results. In terms of relative bargaining power, many of our suppliers are larger than we are, with greater resources, and many of their other customers are larger and have greater resources than we do. If these vendors experience shortages or fail to accurately predict customer demand, they may have insufficient capacity to meet our demand, creating a capacity constraint on our business. They may also choose to supply others in preference to us in times of capacity constraint or otherwise, particularly where the other customers purchase in higher volume. Third-party supplier capacity constraints have in the past and may in the future prevent us from supplying customer demand that we otherwise could have fulfilled at attractive prices. If we have a firm commitment to supply our customers but are unable to do so based on inability or unwillingness of one of our suppliers to provide related materials or services, we may be liable for resulting damages and expense incurred by our customers.\nBased on superior performance features, cost parameters or other factors, we utilize sole source suppliers for certain semiconductor packages and other materials and it is common for one of our outside semiconductor foundries to be our sole supplier for the particular semiconductor fabrication process technologies manufactured at that supplier\u2019s facility. Such supplier concentrations involve the risk of a potential future business interruption if the supplier becomes unable or unwilling to supply us at any point. While in some cases alternate suppliers may exist, because there are limited numbers of third-party wafer suppliers that use the process technologies we select for our products and that have sufficient capacity to meet our needs, it may not be possible or may be expensive to find an alternative source of supply. Even if we are able to find an alternative source, moving production to an alternative supplier requires an extensive qualification or re-qualification process that could prevent or delay product shipments or disrupt customer\u2019s production schedules, which could harm our business. In addition, some of our external foundry suppliers compete against us in the market in addition to being our supplier. The loss of a supplier can also significantly harm our business and operating results. A supplier may discontinue supplying us if its business is not sufficiently profitable, for competitive reasons or otherwise. We have in the past and may in the future have our supply relationship discontinued by an external foundry, causing us to experience supply chain disruption, customer dissatisfaction, loss of business and increased cost.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products.\nWe believe our continued ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate highly-skilled engineering, operations, sales, administrative and managerial personnel is key to our future success. Competition for these employees is intense, particularly with respect to qualified engineers. Our failure to retain our present employees and hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and on reasonable terms could harm our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, from time to time, we may recruit and hire employees from our competitors, customers, suppliers and distributors, which could result in liability to us and has in the past and could in the future, damage our business relationship with these parties. None of our senior management team is contractually bound to remain with us for a specified period, and we generally do not maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any member of our senior management team could strengthen a competitor, weaken customer relationships or harm our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur internal and external manufacturing, assembly and test model subjects us to various manufacturing and supply risks.\nWe operate a leased semiconductor wafer processing and manufacturing facility at our headquarters in Lowell, Massachusetts, and at our Ithaca, New York and Ann Arbor, Michigan sites. These facilities are also important internal design, assembly and test facilities. We maintain other internal assembly and test operation facilities as well, including leased sites in Nashua, New Hampshire, and Hsinchu, Taiwan. We also use multiple external foundries for outsourced semiconductor wafer supply, as well as multiple domestic and Asian assembly and test suppliers to assemble and test our products. A number of factors will affect the future success of these internal manufacturing facilities and outsourced supply and service arrangements, including the following:\n\u25aa\nthe level of demand for our products;\n\u25aa\nour ability to expand and contract our facilities and purchase commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to changes in demand for our products;\n\u25aa\nour ability to generate revenue in amounts that cover the significant fixed costs of operating our facilities;\n\u25aa\nour ability to qualify our facilities for new products and process technologies in a timely manner and successfully avoid issues that may unduly prolong, or otherwise complicate, the qualification process;\n\u25aa\nthe availability of raw materials, including GaAs, SiGe and InP substrates and high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, carbon, nitrite, indium and silicon;\n\u25aa\nthe availability and continued operation of key equipment, especially any that we may only have access to a limited number of;\n\u25aa\nour manufacturing cycle times and yields;\n\u25aa\nthe political and economic risks associated with our reliance on outsourced Asian assembly and test suppliers;\n\u25aa\nthe location of our facilities and those of our outsourced suppliers;\n\u25aa\nnatural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, armed conflicts or unrest impacting our facilities and those of our outsourced suppliers;\n\u25aa\nour ability to hire, train, manage and retain qualified production personnel;\n\u25aa\nour compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations;\n\u25aa\nour ability to avoid prolonged periods of downtime or high levels of scrap in our and our suppliers\u2019 facilities for any reason; and\n\u25aa\nour ability to negotiate renewals to our existing lease agreements on favorable terms and without disruption to our wafer processing and manufacturing and internal assembly and test operations at our sites where such activities take place.\nIf we experience issues in any of the above areas, the effectiveness of our supply chain could be adversely affected, and could harm our results of operations.\nSources for certain components, materials and services are limited, which could result in interruptions, delays or reductions in product shipments.\nOur industry may be affected from time to time by limited supplies of certain key components, materials and services. We have in the past and may in the future, experience delays or reductions in supply shipments, which could reduce our revenue and profitability. If key components, materials or services are unavailable, our costs could increase and our revenue could decline.\nIn particular, our manufacturing headquarters, design facilities, assembly and test facilities and supply chain, and those of our contract manufacturers, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood or other natural or man-made disasters. The majority of our internally-manufactured semiconductor products are fabricated in our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters. The majority of the internal and outsourced assembly and test facilities we utilize are located in the Pacific Rim and some of our internal design, assembly and test facilities are located in California regions with above average seismic and severe weather activity. In addition, our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations, with the expertise of the personnel at each such location generally focused on one or two specific areas. Any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of these facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility and, in some instances, could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or primary market, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, any catastrophic loss at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, revenue and profitability.\nRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.\nIn order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products, to design new products to more stringent standards and to redesign some existing products. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis or at all.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we experience product returns, product liability and defects claims.\nOur products are complex and frequently operate in high-performance, challenging environments. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our products after they are released to the market. If such problems occur or become significant, we may experience reduced revenue and increased costs related to product recalls, inventory write-offs, warranty or damage claims, delays in, cancellations of or returns of product orders and other expenses. Certain of our distributors\nhave inventory return and or rotation rights, which may result in higher than expected product returns. The many materials and vendors used in the manufacture of our products increase the risk that some defects may escape detection in our manufacturing process and subsequently affect our customers, even in the case of long-standing product designs. Our use of newly-developed or less mature semiconductor process technologies, such as GaN and InP, which have a less extensive track record of reliability in the field than other more mature process technologies, also increases the risk of performance and reliability problems. These matters have arisen in our operations from time to time in the past, have resulted in significant expense to us per occurrence and will likely occur again in the future. The occurrence of defects could result in product returns and liability claims, reduced product shipments, the loss of customers, the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, harm to our reputation, diversion of management\u2019s time and resources, lower revenue, increased expenses and reduced profitability. Any warranty or other rights we may have against our suppliers for quality issues caused by them may be more limited than those our customers have against us, based on our relative size, bargaining power or otherwise. In addition, even if we ultimately prevail, such claims could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s time and resources and damage our customer and supplier relationships.\nWe also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that some of our customers integrate our products into consumer products such as automobiles, which are then sold to consumers in the marketplace. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused a loss. Product liability claims could result in significant expenses in connection with the defense of such claims and possible damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in a recall if our products prove to be defective. Any product recall or product liability claim brought against us, particularly in high-volume consumer markets, could have a material negative impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMinor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss or even cause halts in production, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margin.\nOur products involve complexities in both their design and the semiconductor process technology employed in their fabrication. In many cases, the products are also assembled in customized packages or feature high levels of integration. Our products must meet exacting customer specifications for quality, performance and reliability.\nOur manufacturing yield, or the percentage of units of a given product in a given period that is usable relative to all such units produced, is a combination of yields including wafer fabrication, assembly and test yields. Due to the complexity of our products, we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields as even minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss or halt production. Our customers may also test our components once they have been assembled into their products. The number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the following:\n\u25aa\ndesign errors;\n\u25aa\ndefects in photomasks, used to print circuits on wafers;\n\u25aa\nminute impurities in materials used;\n\u25aa\ncontamination of the manufacturing environment;\n\u25aa\nequipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes;\n\u25aa\nlosses from broken wafers or other human errors;\n\u25aa\ndefects in packaging; and\n\u25aa\nissues and errors in testing.\nTypically, for a given level of sales, when our yields improve, our gross margin improves. When our yields decrease, our unit costs are typically higher, our gross margin is lower and our profitability is adversely affected, any or all of which can harm our results of operations and lower our stock price.\nWe depend on third-party sales representatives and distributors for a material portion of our revenues.\nWe sell many of our products to customers through independent sales representatives and distributors, as well as through our direct sales force. We are unable to predict the extent to which our independent sales representatives and distributors will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our independent sales representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products. Our relationships with our representatives and distributors typically may be terminated by either party at any time, and do not require them to buy any of our products. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 33.3% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019, and sales to our largest distributor, Richardson, represented 16.1% of our revenue in the same period. If our sales representatives or distributors cease doing business with us or fail to successfully market and sell our products, our ability to sustain and grow our revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of our worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region, each of which can change from period to period. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate as well as the actual tax ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the amount of our earnings attributable to countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws (or the interpretation of those laws by regulators) or tax rates (particularly in the U.S. or Ireland), increases in non-deductible expenses, the availability of tax credits, material audit assessments or repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, each of which could materially affect our profitability. For example, as of September 27, 2019, we had $923.4 million of gross federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards, which, for those generated prior to the effective date of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), will expire at various dates through 2037, while those generated subsequent to the Tax Act have an indefinite carryforward with no expiration. However, our ability to use these federal NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may be limited and, as a result of our conclusion that recovery of our U.S. deferred tax assets, including those assumed in the AppliedMicro Acquisition, is not considered more likely than not, we established a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2017. Any significant increase in our effective tax rates could materially reduce our net income in future periods and decrease the value of your investment in our common stock.\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations (including new laws and interpretations) are introduced from time to time to reform taxation in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we have operations. Depending on the nature of such changes, if any, these consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities. If any changes are enacted or otherwise implemented, they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and, thereby, on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex, and we are not able to finalize our evaluation of the impact of the Tax Act at this time due to uncertainties related to any future legislative or regulatory actions related to the Tax Act and availability of information needed to perform the final calculations. Accordingly, there is the risk that our use of deferred tax assets valuation allowance as well as our effective tax rate may be adversely affected.\nWe may make future acquisitions and investments, which involve numerous risks.\nWe routinely evaluate potential acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances involving complementary technologies, design teams, products and companies. We may pursue such transactions if appropriate opportunities arise. However, we may not be able to identify suitable transactions in the future or if we do identify such transactions, we may not be able to complete them on commercially acceptable terms or at all. We also face intense competition for acquisitions from other acquirers in our industry. These competing acquirers may have significantly greater financial and other resources than us, which may prevent us from successfully pursuing a transaction. In the event we pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances, we will face numerous risks including:\n\u25aa\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties in entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u25aa\ndifficulties in improving and integrating the financial reporting capabilities and operating systems of any acquired operations, particularly foreign and formerly private operations, as needed to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u25aa\nloss of any key personnel of the acquired company as well as their know-how, relationships and expertise, which is common following an acquisition;\n\u25aa\nmaintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations;\n\u25aa\ngenerating insufficient revenue from completed acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances to offset increased expenses associated with any abandoned or completed transactions;\n\u25aa\nacquiring material or unknown leasehold, environmental, regulatory, infringement, contractual or other liabilities associated with any acquired operations;\n\u25aa\nlitigation frequently associated with merger and acquisition transactions; and\n\u25aa\nincreasing expense associated with amortization or depreciation of intangible and tangible assets we acquire.\nOur past transactions required or continue to require significant management time and attention relating to the transaction. Past transactions, whether completed or abandoned by us, have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs, expenses, liabilities and charges to earnings. The accounting treatment for any future transaction may result in significant amortizable intangible assets which, when amortized, will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. The accounting treatment may also result in significant goodwill, which, if impaired, will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for transactions. The incurrence of debt could limit our operating flexibility and be detrimental to our profitability, and the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Participation in joint ventures and strategic alliances may\nlimit our ability to realize the full benefit of our technology to the extent that, as a result of such transaction, the future benefit of such technology is shared with our transaction partners. Any or all of the above factors may differ from the investment community\u2019s expectations in a given quarter, which could negatively affect our stock price. In addition, as a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to successfully execute transactions in the future to the same extent as we have the in the past, if at all.\nIn the event we make future investments, the investments may decline in value or fail to deliver any strategic benefits we anticipate from them and we may lose all or part of our investment.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and personnel of our acquired companies and businesses, and may not realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we complete acquisitions of companies and certain businesses of companies, and we may not realize the expected benefits from such acquisitions because of integration difficulties or other challenges. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from integrating the acquired businesses with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties we may face in integrating the operations of our acquisitions include, among others:\n\u25aa\nfailure to implement our business plans for the combined businesses and consolidation or expansion of production capacity as planned and where applicable;\n\u25aa\nunexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of our acquired companies and businesses;\n\u25aa\nunanticipated issues in conforming our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u25aa\ncoordinating new product and process development;\n\u25aa\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u25aa\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25aa\nadverse effects on our or our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 existing business relationships;\n\u25aa\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u25aa\noperating risks inherent in our acquired companies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 business and operations;\n\u25aa\nunanticipated expenses and liabilities;\n\u25aa\npotential unfamiliarity with our acquired companies and businesses technology, products and markets, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u25aa\nother difficulties in the assimilation of our acquired companies and businesses operations, technologies, products and systems.\nOur acquired companies and businesses may have unanticipated or larger than anticipated liabilities for patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, taxes and other known and unknown types of liabilities. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of our acquired companies and businesses. We may have no recourse or limited recourse under the applicable acquisition-related agreement to recover damages relating to the liabilities of our acquired companies and businesses.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of our acquired companies and businesses and us had historically achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of our acquired companies and businesses smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the business of our acquired companies or businesses deteriorates, the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of our acquired companies and businesses may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If any of the above risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors or analysts, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing any future growth.\nTo successfully conduct business in a rapidly evolving market, we must effectively plan and manage any current and future growth. Our ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25aa\nmaintaining access to sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demands;\n\u25aa\narranging for sufficient supply of key raw materials and services to avoid shortages or supply bottlenecks;\n\u25aa\nbuilding out our administrative infrastructure at the proper pace to support any current and future sales growth while maintaining operating efficiencies;\n\u25aa\nadhering to our high quality and process execution standards, particularly as we hire and train new employees and during periods of high volume;\n\u25aa\nmanaging the various components of our working capital effectively;\n\u25aa\nupgrading our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including improvement of our accounting and internal management systems; and\n\u25aa\nmaintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.\nIf we do not effectively manage any future growth, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive opportunities in our markets, our operations may be impacted, and we may experience delays in delivering products to our customers or damaged customer relationships and achieve lower than anticipated revenue and decreased profitability.\nWe may incur higher than expected expense from or not realize the expected benefits, or any benefits, of consolidation, outsourcing and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations.\nWe have pursued in the past and may pursue in the future various restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations, including reductions in our number of manufacturing facilities, workforce reductions, establishing certain operations closer in location to our global customers and evaluating functions that may be more efficiently performed through outsourcing arrangements. For example, on June 17, 2019, we committed to a restructuring plan designed to streamline and improve our operations. The plan includes the refocusing of certain research and development activities and a reduction in workforce and is expected to provide annual expense savings of approximately $50.0 million once fully implemented. Our restructuring initiative could result in potential adverse effects on employee capabilities, our continued ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate highly-skilled engineering, operations, sales, administrative and managerial and other key personnel, our ability to achieve design wins and our ability to maintain and enhance our customer base. Such events could harm our efficiency and our ability to act quickly and effectively in the rapidly changing technology markets in which we sell our products. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to realign our organizational structure and shift our investments. The potential negative impact of a restructuring plan on our employees may limit our ability to meet and satisfy the demands of our customers and, as a result, have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestructuring initiatives can be substantial in scope and disruptive to our operations and they can involve large expenditures. In fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred restructuring charges of $19.5 million, $6.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from reductions in our workforce. Exiting a leased site may involve contractual or negotiated exit payments with the landlord, temporary holding over at an increased lease rate, costs to perform restoration work required by the lease or associated environmental liability, any of which may be material in amount. Consolidation of operations and outsourcing may involve substantial capital expenses and the transfer of manufacturing processes and personnel from one site to another, with resultant startup issues at the receiving site and the need for re-qualification of the transitioned operations with major customers and for ISO or other certifications. We may experience shortages of affected products, delays and higher than expected expenses. Affected employees may be distracted by the transition or may seek other employment, which could cause our overall operational efficiency to suffer. Any of these issues or our failure to realize the expected benefits of these initiatives could harm our results of operations and reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur business may be harmed if systems manufacturers choose not to use components made of the compound semiconductor materials we utilize.\nSilicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for the manufacture of ICs in high-volume, commercial markets and the performance of silicon ICs continues to improve. While we use silicon for some applications, we also often use compound semiconductor technologies such as GaAs, InP, SiGe or GaN to deliver reliable operation at higher power, higher frequency or smaller form factor than a silicon solution has historically allowed. While these compound semiconductor materials offer high-performance features, it is generally more difficult to design and manufacture products with reliability and in volume using them. GaN and InP, in particular, are newer process technologies that do not have as extensive a track record of reliable performance in the field as many of the competing process technologies. Compound semiconductor technology tends to be more expensive than silicon technology due to its above-described challenges and the generally lower volumes at which parts in those processes tend to be manufactured relative to silicon parts for high-volume consumer applications.\nSystem designers in some markets may be reluctant to adopt our non-silicon products or may be likely to adopt silicon products in lieu of our products if silicon products meeting their demanding performance requirements are available, because of:\n\u25aa\ntheir unfamiliarity with designing systems using our products;\n\u25aa\ntheir concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields;\n\u25aa\ntheir unfamiliarity with our design and manufacturing processes; or\n\u25aa\nuncertainties about the relative cost effectiveness of our products compared to high-performance silicon components.\nWe cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will design our compound semiconductor products into their systems or that the companies that have utilized our products will continue to do so in the future. Improvements in the performance of available silicon process technologies and solutions could result in a loss of market share on our part. If our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance for any of the above reasons, our results of operations will suffer.\nThe outcome of litigation in which we are involved in is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could subject us to damage awards and lower the market price of our stock.\nFrom time to time we are a party to litigation matters such as those described in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d below. These and any other future disputes, litigations, investigations, administrative proceedings or enforcement actions we may be involved in may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations, result in negative publicity and harm our customer or supplier relationships. Although we intend to contest such matters vigorously, we cannot assure you that their outcome will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any such matter in the future, including the results of any amicable settlement, could subject us to material damage awards or settlement payments, loss of contractual or other rights, injunctions or other limitations on the operation of our business or other material harm to our business.\nOur limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur future success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our protection of our proprietary information and technology through patent filings, enforcement of agreements related to intellectual property and otherwise. We cannot be certain that any patents we apply for will be issued or that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Our competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Similarly, counterparties to our intellectual property agreements may fail to comply with their obligations under those agreements, requiring us to resort to expensive and time-consuming litigation in an attempt to protect our rights, which may or may not be successful. The laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products. Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may need to expend significant financial and other resources in defending our rights.\nIn addition, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. We cannot be sure that these agreements will be adequate and will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by others.\nAdditionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. Patent litigation is expensive and our ability to enforce our patents and other intellectual property, is limited by our financial resources and is subject to general litigation risks. If we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid, are otherwise not enforceable or are licensed to the party against whom we assert a claim. In addition, our assertion of intellectual property rights could result in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us, which is a frequent occurrence in such litigations.\nWe face risks associated with government contracting.\nSome of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. government or subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, we may be subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of U.S. government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the U.S. government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.\nIn connection with our U.S. government business, we may also be subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining\nfuture contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnder some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. Complying with these standards can be both costly and time consuming, and can adversely affect our ability to compete in commercial markets. If we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were to lose their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nWe may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs to comply with environmental laws, and if we fail to comply with environmental laws, we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to change our operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local governmental regulations directed at preventing or mitigating climate change and other environmental harms, as well as to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. If we fail to comply with these regulations, substantial fines could be imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production, alter manufacturing processes, cease operations or remediate polluted land, air or groundwater, any of which could have a negative effect on our revenue, results of operations and business. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities, or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes, or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, under some of these laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties or those nearby are contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. We have incurred in the past and may in the future incur environmental liability based on the actions of prior owners, lessees or neighbors of sites we have leased or may lease in the future, third party commercial waste disposal sites we utilize or sites we become associated with due to acquisitions. We cannot predict:\n\u25aa\nchanges in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations;\n\u25aa\nthe manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;\n\u25aa\nour ability to enforce and collect under any indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities; or\n\u25aa\nthe cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions.\nIn addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies, lessors at sites we currently lease or have been associated with in the past and other private parties. We may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment or fine levied against us or agreed settlement payment could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, since 1993, MACOM Connectivity Solutions, LLC (formerly known as AppliedMicro) has been named as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") along with more than 100 other companies that used the Omega Chemical Corporation waste treatment facility in Whittier, California (the \"Omega Site\"). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has alleged that the Omega Site failed to properly treat and dispose of certain hazardous waste material. We are a member of a large group of PRPs, known as the Omega Chemical Site PRP Organized Group (\"OPOG\"), which has agreed to fund certain ongoing remediation efforts at and nearby the Omega Site and with respect to the regional groundwater allegedly contaminated thereby.\nBased on currently available information with respect to the total anticipated level of investigatory, remedial and monitoring costs to be incurred by the OPOG and our allocable share of those costs, we have a loss accrual for the Omega Site that is not material. However, the proceedings are ongoing and several factors beyond our control, such as growth in overall remedial costs, insolvency of members of OPOG, or the prosecution of third party contribution or cost recovery actions against OPOG, could cause this loss accrual to prove inadequate. In addition, in 2012, as a result of the PRP group's modification of its liability allocation formulae and the withdrawal of PRP group members from OPOG, our proportional allocation of responsibility among the PRPs increased. Subsequently, certain other PRPs withdrew from OPOG or initiated bankruptcy proceedings, and legal proceedings and settlement negotiations with these parties are continuing. Any future increases to our allocation of responsibility among the PRPs or the future reduction of parties participating in the PRP group could materially increase our potential liability relating to the Omega Site.\nEnvironmental regulations such as the WEEE and RoHS directives limit our flexibility and may require us to incur material expense.\nVarious countries require companies selling a broad range of electrical equipment to conform to regulations such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\"WEEE\") and the European Directive 2002/95/Ec on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\"). New environmental standards such as these could require us to redesign our products in order to comply with the standards, require the development of compliance administration systems or otherwise limit our flexibility in running our business or require us to incur substantial compliance costs. For example, RoHS requires that certain substances be removed from most electronic components. The\nWEEE directive makes producers of electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. We have already invested significant resources into complying with these regimes, and further investments may be required. Alternative designs implemented in response to regulation may be costlier to produce, resulting in an adverse effect on our gross profit margin. If we cannot develop compliant products in a timely fashion or properly administer our compliance programs, our revenue may also decline due to lower sales, which would adversely affect our operating results. Further, if we were found to be non-compliant with any rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur term loan and revolving credit facility could result in outstanding debt with a claim to our assets that is senior to that of our stockholders and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nAs of September 27, 2019, we had a credit facility consisting of a term loan facility with an outstanding principle balance of $673.0 million and a revolving credit facility with $160.0 million of available borrowing capacity. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries. The amount of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25aa\nwe may be unable or limited in our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u25aa\nwe may be limited in our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in a sale or liquidation until our debt is repaid in full;\n\u25aa\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u25aa\nour cash flow from operations will be allocated to the payment of the principal of and interest on, any outstanding indebtedness; and\n\u25aa\nwe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs.\nOur credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants that may limit or eliminate our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, pay dividends, make investments and loans, make acquisitions, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, enter into transactions with our affiliates, enter into new lines of business and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganizations transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to withstand downturns in our business or the economy in general or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not subject to such restrictions. If we breach a loan covenant, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us or accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. We might not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our subsidiaries securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nCustomer demands and regulations related to \u201cconflict\u201d minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and liabilities.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated rules regarding disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and related assemblies. These requirements may adversely affect our ability to source related minerals and metals and increase our related cost. We face difficulties and increased expenses associated with complying with the related disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Continued timely reporting is dependent upon the improvement and implementation of new systems and processes and information supplied by our suppliers of products that contain or potentially contain, conflict minerals. Our supply chain is complex and some suppliers may be unwilling to share related confidential information regarding the source of their products or may provide us information that is inaccurate or inadequate. If those risks arise or if our processes in obtaining that information do not fulfill the SEC\u2019s requirements, we may face both reputational challenges and SEC enforcement risks based on our inability to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals and metals or otherwise. More recently, executive orders issued by the President of the United States have increased sanctions in this area as well, which may impact us in the scenarios described above. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy any related requirements of our customers, which may be different from or more onerous than the requirements of the related SEC rules and executive orders. If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products or may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may experience lower than expected revenues or have to write off inventory in the event that it becomes unsalable as a result of these regulations.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company, we derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments or distributions to meet our operating needs. Legal and contractual restrictions in any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The deterioration of the earnings from or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of a security breach, cybersecurity incident or disruption of our information technology systems.\nWe increasingly rely on sophisticated information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and business data, employee data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. We also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive confidential data related to our business, employees and operations. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. However, our physical facilities and our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we fail to maintain the integrity of our systems or data or if we experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely and materially affect our business.\nWe may also be subject to security breaches caused by human error, inadequate or outdated software or tools, computer viruses or ransomware, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, misappropriation or acts of vandalism by employees or third parties. Cyber attacks and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more frequent and sophisticated and may be successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in our network infrastructure, or impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect, contain and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information of us or third parties could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business and reputation. To the extent that any security breach impacts the operation of our products in the field or results in inappropriate disclosure of third party confidential information, we may incur liability, governmental sanctions, reputational damage or impaired business relationships as a result, which could harm our business. While we expect to continually invest in additional resources and services to bolster the security of our information technology systems, no amount of investment will eliminate these risks entirely.\nVariability in self-insurance liability estimates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe self-insure for employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage up to a predetermined level, beyond which we maintain stop-loss insurance from a third-party insurer. Our aggregate exposure varies from year to year based upon the number of participants in our insurance plans. We estimate our self-insurance liabilities using an analysis provided by our claims administrator and our historical claims experience. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect these estimates and other management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we self-insure increases, it could cause a material and adverse change to our reserves for self-insurance liabilities, as well as to our earnings.\nWe rely on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services, including, among other things, certain services related to information technology and network development and monitoring. We depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable, high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor\u2019s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nFailure to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation or other data privacy regimes could subject us to significant fines and reputational harm.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex data privacy compliance environment and the potential for high-profile negative publicity in the event of any data breach. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the United States and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") is a comprehensive update to the data protection regime in the European Economic Area that is effective as of May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes new requirements relating to, among other things, consent to process personal data of individuals, the information provided to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, the security and confidentiality of personal data, and notifications in the event of data breaches and use of third party processors. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of the worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources into our GDPR compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts generally. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR or other applicable regimes.\nWe may be subject to liabilities based on alleged links between the semiconductor manufacturing process and certain illnesses and birth defects.\nIn recent years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports regarding a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and birth defects and certain illnesses, primarily cancer. Regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to determine if any actual correlation exists. Because we utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims alleging personal injury. These, and any future, reports or studies may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, a significant judgment against us or material defense costs could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur portfolio of marketable securities is significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of marketable securities. Changes in the value of this portfolio could adversely affect our earnings. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases or decreases in interest rates, downgrades of money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds included in our portfolio, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe may engage in future capital-raising transactions that dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders or cause us to incur debt.\nWe may issue additional equity, debt or convertible securities to raise capital in the future. If we do, existing stockholders may experience significant further dilution. In addition, new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges that differ from or are senior to, those of our existing stockholders. Our incurrence of indebtedness could limit our operating flexibility and be detrimental to our results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. In addition to the risks described in this Annual Report, other factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant customers;\n\u25aa\nannouncements by us or our competitors, customers or suppliers of significant products, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or other events;\n\u25aa\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including any injunction issued or material sums paid for damage awards, settlement payments, license fees, attorney\u2019s fees or other litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;\n\u25aa\nfailure to complete significant sales or to win a competitive selection process;\n\u25aa\ndevelopments concerning current or future strategic alliances or acquisitions;\n\u25aa\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u25aa\nadditions or departures of directors, executives or key personnel.\nFor example, on August 1, 2017 we announced results of operations for our third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and a financial outlook for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 that were below the then-current consensus of securities analyst expectations. The closing price per share of our common stock thereafter declined from $61.06 on August 1, 2017 to $45.50 on August 2, 2017, and further to $39.67 on August 18, 2017, representing a cumulative decline of approximately 35.0%. Furthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease their coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur common stock price may decline if a substantial number of shares are sold in the market by our stockholders.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Increased sales of our common stock in the market for any reason could exert significant downward pressure on our stock price. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nWe are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in \"Item 9A.- Controls and Procedures\" below.\nThe existence of a material weakness in our internal controls may adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow results of operations or the trading price of our stock.\nSome of our stockholders can exert control over us and they may not make decisions that reflect our interests or those of other stockholders.\nOur largest stockholders control a significant amount of our outstanding common stock. As of September 27, 2019, John and Susan Ocampo beneficially owned 30.0% of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our securities. In addition, the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider beneficial and may adversely affect the price of our stock.\nProvisions of our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and third amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include authorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, staggered elections of directors and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to be submitted to a stockholder vote. Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law may prohibit business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us and this reliance could reduce our value.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. In addition, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.", "PERMNO": 13326, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "MTSI"}
