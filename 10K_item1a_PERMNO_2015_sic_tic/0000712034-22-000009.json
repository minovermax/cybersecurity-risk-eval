RISK FACTORS\nThe factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that are not deemed material also may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nEconomic and Strategic Risks\nOur business and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results depends on future developments, including the severity, duration and spread of the COVID-19 virus and its existing and future variants within the markets in which we operate and public health measures and other actions taken throughout the world to contain or mitigate the effects of the pandemic, especially to the extent that these result in office and school closures or negatively impact our global supply chain or the availability of our workforce. Further, the breadth and duration of disruption to businesses and schools and the overall impact of the pandemic and its consequences on the global economy, all of which are highly uncertain and ever-changing, will impact the extent to which COVID-19 affects our business and financial results.\nThe demand for certain of our products, especially our school and office products, has been and will continue to be impacted by office and school closures resulting from COVID-19. Our North America segment and our businesses in Australia, Brazil and Mexico are highly dependent on back-to-school business. Throughout 2021, sales in our Brazilian and Mexican businesses were significantly and adversely affected by school closures in those countries. Office closures and hybrid work arrangements also have and will continue to impact sales of office products globally. Further delays in the reopening of schools and offices, or renewed school or office closures, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continue to monitor government recommendations regarding COVID-19 and make necessary modifications to our operations to protect the health and safety of our employees, suppliers and customers. While we have taken, and will continue to take, actions which serve to reduce the possibility of transmission of the virus within our workplace, they do not assure that our employees will not contract the virus or bring it to the workplace. Furthermore, we may be forced to close locations for reasons such as the health of our employees, disruptions in our supply chain, or due to further governmental orders. Were such an event to occur, our operations could be disrupted to varying degrees which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe expect that the pandemic will continue to adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations for some time, but we cannot reasonably estimate the duration or magnitude of its future financial impact. We also are uncertain as to the impact the pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers, industry and employees over the longer term. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts on our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression, and changes in the behavior of customers, consumers and other end users, among other factors.\nA limited number of large customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales, and the loss of, or a substantial reduction in sales to, or gross profit from, or significant decline in the financial condition of one or more of these customers could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur top ten customers accounted for 45 percent of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, or gross profit from, one or more of our top customers, or significant adverse changes to the terms on which we sell our products to one or more of our top customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe environment in which our large customers operate is highly competitive and rapidly changing. The key channels of distribution for our products have been changing. Mass retailers and e-tailers have taken, and continue to take, market share from office superstores, wholesalers and other traditional office products resellers. This shift in sales and market share away from our traditional commercial customers (which historically carried a wider, more profitable range of our products) has negatively impacted our margins.\nIn response to competitive pressures, our large commercial customers, especially the office superstores and wholesalers, continue to evolve their businesses. We have seen, and expect to continue to see, consolidating activity and business model changes with large customers in the U.S., Europe and Australia. These activities drive regular personnel turnover which have made, and will continue to make, our business relationships with our large customers more challenging and unpredictable.\nWe seek to grow sales and market share in the faster growing mass merchant and e-tailer channels, increase our direct sales to independent dealers and consumers, and expand distribution, both organically and through acquisitions, into new and growing channels and geographies and enter new adjacencies, while maintaining strong margins. We may not be successful in executing against these strategies fast enough to offset the declines we are experiencing in the traditional commercial channels, if at all. Our inability to successfully manage the shift away from distribution channels which are declining, and profitably grow sales and market share with customers and consumers in faster growing channels, could have a material adverse impact on our sales, margins, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur customer concentration increases our customer credit risk. If any of our larger customers were to face liquidity issues, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, we could be adversely impacted due to not only a reduction in future sales but also delays or defaults in the payment of existing accounts receivable balances. Such a result could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, should one of our suppliers or third-party service providers experience financial difficulties, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales of our products may be adversely affected by factors that influence discretionary spending by our customers and consumers during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness.\nOur business depends on discretionary spending, and, as a result, our performance is highly dependent on consumer and business confidence and the health of the economies in the countries in which we operate. Discretionary spending and the overall health of the economies in the countries in which we operate is affected by many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control. During periods of economic uncertainty or weakness, our reseller customers often reduce inventories both to reduce their own working capital investments and because demand for our products decreases as customers and consumers switch to private label and other branded and/or generic products that compete on price and quality, or forgo purchases altogether. Decreases in demand for our products can result in the need to spend more on promotional activities. Overall, adverse changes in economic conditions or sustained periods of economic uncertainty or weakness in one or more of the geographic markets in which we operate, whatever the cause, have negatively affected our historical sales and profitability and, in the future, could have an adverse effect on our sales, business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nThe Company has foreign currency translation and transaction exposure that has, and is likely to continue to, materially affect the Company\u2019s sales, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nApproximately 54 percent of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, were transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar is in the Euro, the Swedish krona, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso.\nThe fluctuations in the foreign currency rates relative to the U.S. dollar can cause translation, transaction, and other gains and losses in our non-U.S.-based businesses, which impact our sales, profitability and cash flow. Our primary exposure is from translation of our foreign operations' results. Generally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies negatively impacts the Company\u2019s reported sales and operating margins. Conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies generally has a positive effect.\nWe source approximately 60 percent of our products from lower cost countries, primarily in Asia using U.S. dollars. This creates transactional exposure in our foreign markets. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies in these markets increases our cost of goods and reduces our margins on products sold in local currency. When this occurs, we seek to raise prices in our foreign markets to recover the lost margin. Due to competitive pressures and the timing of these price increases relative to the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, it is often difficult to increase prices fast enough to fully offset the cumulative impact of the foreign-exchange-related inflation on our cost of goods sold in these markets.\nFrom time to time, we may use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates\nover the limited time the hedges are in place, and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency fluctuations.\nCurrency exchange rates can be volatile especially in times of global, political and economic tension or uncertainty. Additionally, government actions such as currency devaluations, foreign exchange controls, imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions, and price or profit controls can further negatively impact, and increase the volatility of, foreign currency exchange rates.\nChallenges related to the highly competitive business environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by large, sophisticated customers; low barriers to entry for certain of our products; and competition from a wide range of products and services (including private label products and electronic and digital products and services that can replace or render certain of our products obsolete). We have seen, and expect to continue to see, increased competition from private label brands.\nACCO Brands competes with numerous branded consumer products manufacturers, as well as numerous private label suppliers and importers, including many of our customers who import their own private label products directly from foreign sources. Many of our competitors have strong, sought-after brands. Their ability to manufacture products locally at a lower cost or source them from other countries with lower production costs can give them a competitive advantage in terms of price under certain circumstances. In addition, as competitive pressures cause our customers to close or reduce the size of their retail locations, and diversify their product offerings, the available retail space devoted to our products is further limited.\nOur business has been, and we expect it will continue to be, affected by actions taken by our customers and competitors to compete more effectively. Any such actions could result in lower sales and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market innovative products that meet consumer demands, including price expectations, and to expand into new and adjacent product categories that are experiencing higher growth rates.\nOur success depends on our ability to invest in innovation and product development and successfully anticipate, develop and market products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our consumers. Additionally, part of our strategy is to develop new, exciting and differentiated products that support our shift towards a faster growing, more consumer-oriented business. There can be no assurance that we will make the right investment choices or be successful developing innovative, consumer-oriented products. If we are unable to successfully increase sales and margins by expanding our product assortment, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nGrowth in emerging geographies may be difficult to achieve and exposes us to financial, operational, regulatory, compliance, and other risks not present, or not as prevalent, in more established markets.\nTwelve percent of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, is derived from emerging markets such as Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the profitable growth of our business in emerging markets, through both organic investments and acquisitions, is a key element to our long-term growth strategy.\nEmerging markets generally involve more financial, operational, regulatory and compliance risks than more mature markets. As we expand and grow in these markets, we increase our exposure to these risks. These risks include currency transfer restrictions, currency fluctuations, changes in international trade and tax policies and regulations (including import and export restrictions), and a lack of well-established or reliable legal systems. Additionally, in some cases, emerging markets also have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and are more susceptible to corruption, civil unrest, military disruptions, terrorism, public health crises, severe weather conditions, and natural disasters. Weak or corrupt legal systems may affect our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property, contractual and other rights. Further, these emerging markets are generally more remote from our headquarters location and have different cultures which may make it be more difficult to impose corporate standards and procedures and the extraterritorial laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws.\nIf we are unable to profitably grow our existing emerging market businesses or expand into other emerging markets, achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments, or effectively manage the risks inherent in operating in these markets, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nContinued declines in the use of certain of our products have and will continue to adversely affect our business.\nA number of our products and brands consist of paper-based and related products. As use of technology-based tools continues to rise worldwide and the nature of work and school evolves in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for traditional paper-based and related products, such as decorative calendars, planners, envelopes, ring binders, lever arch files and other paper storage and organization products, and mechanical binding equipment, has declined. The impact of tariff and commodity price driven inflation in the U.S. in recent years has resulted in higher pricing (especially for steel, aluminum, and paper-based products) which may, in turn, accelerate the pace of change in consumer preferences for product substitutes. The decline in the overall demand for certain of the products we sell has adversely impacted our business and results of operations, and we expect it will continue to do so.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which makes it difficult to forecast our quarterly results and could materially adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we experienced a more normal seasonality in 2021, ongoing disruption from the pandemic, particularly in our International segment, negatively impacted demand. Historically, each of our segments has demand that varies based on certain seasonal drivers as discussed in \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Seasonality\" of this report.\nAs a result of the seasonal nature of the demand for our products, we expect to continue to generate a significant percentage of our sales and profit during the second, third, and fourth quarters, although the amounts generated in each of these quarters may vary due to changing customer behaviors. However, all of our operating cash flow is generated in the second half of the year, as the cash inflows in the first quarter are consumed building working capital. Our third and fourth quarter cash flow comes from completing the working capital cycle.\nIf these typical seasonal increases in sales of certain products do not materialize, as has been the case in recent years due to the pandemic, or when sales of these product lines represent a larger overall percentage of our sales or profitability, it could have an outsized impact on our business that would adversely affect our sales, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the ordering patterns of our customers have resulted in, and may continue to result in, fluctuations in quarterly sales and profitability.\nThe level of investment returns on pension plan assets and the assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations, as well as the significant unfunded liabilities, including the unfunded liabilities of the U.S. multi-employer pension plan in which we are a participant, could also affect the Company\u2019s pension plan expenses and funding requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $225.5 million recorded as pension liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, or discount rates increase the present value of liabilities, the Company could be required to make larger contributions. The markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore the Company\u2019s estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required future contributions and adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe also participate in a multi-employer pension plan for our union employees at our Ogdensburg, New York facility. The plan has reported significant underfunded liabilities and declared itself in critical and declining status. As a result, the trustees of the plan adopted a rehabilitation plan in an effort to forestall insolvency. Our required contributions to this plan could increase due to the shrinking contribution base resulting from the insolvency or withdrawal of other participating employers, the inability or the failure of withdrawing participating employers to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, and other funding deficiencies. The present value of our withdrawal liability payments could be significant and would be recorded as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first year of our withdrawal. See also \"Note 6. Pension and Other Retiree Benefits\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nImpairment of intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have approximately $1.7 billion of goodwill and other specifically identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2021. Future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value, or fair value, of our intangible assets that would require impairment charges to our financial results. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our sales and customer base, the unfavorable resolution of litigation, a material adverse change in our relationship with significant customers, or a sustained decline in our stock price. We continue to evaluate the impact of developments from our reporting units (particularly in our International segment) to assess whether impairment indicators are present. See also \"Note 10. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\" to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report.\nOur inability to secure, protect and maintain rights to intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, the success and future growth of our gaming accessories business depends on its ability to license the right to use the trademarks and other intellectual property of the major gaming console makers and video game publishers.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks and trade names, but also our patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyrights, and licensing agreements, to be an important and valuable part of our business. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness, dilute the value of our brands, cause confusion in the marketplace, and materially impact our sales and profitability.\nOur gaming accessories business licenses trademarks and other intellectual property from the three major gaming console manufacturers as well as numerous high profile video game publishers. The loss or non-renewal of one or more of these licenses would, in all likelihood, materially and adversely impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our ability to expand our gaming accessories business into certain new geographies requires that we obtain additional licensing rights from the gaming console manufacturers and video game publishers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these additional licensing rights.\nOperational Risks\nDisruptions in the global supply chain have had an adverse impact on our operations, sales, profitability and cash flow which we expect to continue for some time.\nWe manufacture approximately 40 percent of the products we sell where we operate and purchase the remaining 60 percent from suppliers in lower cost countries, primarily in Asia. We also purchase component parts and raw materials for our manufactured products from third parties many of which are also imported from Asia. Additionally, we rely on international freight carriers and domestic trucking and rail lanes to import and distribute products to our customers throughout the world. We continue to experience significant disruptions in our global supply chain due to insufficient freight carrier capacity, port delays and closures, the cost and availability of international and domestic freight carriers, and labor shortages. These and other supply chain disruptions, which are affecting all of our operating segments, began in late 2020 and continued to escalate throughout 2021 and continue in 2022. These disruptions have resulted in increased logistic expenses. The disruptions have also caused product availability issues, resulting in back orders, lost sales and customer fines for late deliveries, and a significant increase in our inventory levels which is negatively impacting our working capital efficiency. We expect the global supply chain disruptions to continue for some time and it remains uncertain when they will be resolved and to what extent they will adversely affect our operations, sales, profitability and cash flow.\nOur operating results have been, and continue to be, adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other necessary supplies and services and the cost of finished goods.\nThe price and availability of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other necessary supplies and services used in our business, as well as the cost of finished goods, can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic and competitive conditions. The ongoing global imbalance between the supply and demand for commodities, component parts, transportation and labor have impacted their availability and increased their cost. We have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience cost increases from our suppliers of raw materials, component parts and purchased finished goods as well as increased labor and commodity costs in our own facilities. Our third-party manufacturers are also affected by these inflationary pressures which has, in turn, resulted in an increase in the amount we pay for finished goods. Additionally, the disruptions in the global supply chain noted above have resulted in increased logistics costs and have affected the availability of imported products, raw materials and component parts we use in our domestic manufacturing.\nDuring periods of rising costs, we manage this volatility through a variety of actions, including targeted advance or periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts, sales price increases and the use of certain derivative instruments. We have implemented price increases, and plan to implement additional price increases in 2022, in an effort to offset the inflationary and supply-chain related cost increases noted above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate the impact of these cost increases fast enough to minimize the adverse effects on our margins, if at all. Additionally, we may lose sales as a result of lack of product availability or due to increasing our selling prices to our customers as we seek to offset these cost increases. Conversely, when these costs decline, customer insistence on lower prices will likely result in lower sales prices, absent other mitigating circumstances and, to the extent we have existing inventory, may result in lower margins.\nOur gaming and computer accessories businesses have been and, we expect that they will continue to be, impacted by the global shortage of microchips.\nOur PowerA gaming and Kensington computer accessories businesses have been recently impacted by the global shortage of microchips which are components of many of our gaming and other technology products. Additionally, the demand for gaming controllers is significantly impacted by the availability of gaming consoles which have been in short supply due to the microchip shortage. Although we carry a supply of microchips for our gaming controllers, the shortage of microchips has affected our ability to source sufficient quantities of our other popular technology products, such as docking stations, which has resulted in lost sales and increased costs. In addition, the limited availability of new gaming consoles has reduced the demand for our controllers and other gaming accessories which, we believe, has negatively impacted our sales. While we expect these impacts will mitigate as the supply of microchips increases to meet demand, it is uncertain when the supply constraints will abate and there can be no assurance that we will recover the lost sales in the future. Likewise, should the shortage continue or re-occur, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient microchips at acceptable pricing to meet the demand for our products which could affect our sales and profitability. Additionally, ongoing constraints on the availability of, or a future reduction in sales of gaming consoles may also adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nOutsourcing the production of certain of our products, our information technology systems and other administrative functions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe outsource certain manufacturing functions, such as product design and production, to third party suppliers. This creates a number of risks, including decreased control over the engineering and manufacturing processes which can result in cost overruns, delayed deliveries or shortages, inferior product quality, and loss or misappropriation of trade secrets. Additionally, we rely on our suppliers to ensure that our products meet our design and product content specifications, and all applicable laws, including product safety, security, labor, and environmental laws. We also expect our suppliers to conform to our and our customers\u2019 and licensors' codes of conduct and expectations with respect to product safety, product quality and social responsibility, and be responsive to our audits. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in our having to cease doing business with a supplier or cease production at a particular facility, stop selling or recall non-conforming products, or having imported product detained at the port or subject to exclusion or seizure. Substitute suppliers might not be available or, if available, might be unwilling or unable to offer products on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Moreover, if one or more of our suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide products of acceptable quality, at acceptable cost or in a timely manner due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, including as a result of disruptions associated with circumstances outside their control, or if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current suppliers, or others, in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. Any of these events could result in unforeseen production delays and increased costs and negatively affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also outsource important portions of our information technology infrastructure and systems support to third-party service providers. Outsourcing of information technology services creates risks to our business, which are similar to those created by our product production outsourcing.\nIn addition, we outsource certain administrative functions, such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration, to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers to whom we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors they make. Depending on the function involved, such errors may lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, loss of or damage to intellectual property, legal and regulatory exposure, or harm to employee morale.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business. Any material failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology or its supporting infrastructure could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems, many of which are outsourced to third-party service providers. We depend on these systems and our third-party service providers to effectively manage our business and execute the production, distribution and sale of our products, as well as to manage and report our financial results and run other support functions. Although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls, if our third-party service providers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory levels, our business could suffer. Additionally, if one or more of our information technology suppliers is unable or unwilling to continue to provide services at acceptable cost due to financial difficulties, insolvency or otherwise, our business could be adversely affected.\nFurther, our failure to properly maintain and successfully upgrade or replace any of these systems, especially our enterprise resource planning systems, could disrupt our business and our ability to service our customers or negatively impact our ability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner.\nIf our day-to-day business operations or our ability to service our customers is negatively impacted by the failure or disruption of our information technology systems, if we are unable to accurately and timely report our financial results, or if we conclude that we do not have effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, it could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches could compromise our confidential and proprietary information, as well as any personally identifiable information we hold, and expose us to operational and legal risks that could cause our business and reputation to suffer and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain information and applications necessary to conduct our business in data centers, on our networks and with third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personally identifiable information regarding our customers and employees. Our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions which creates the risk that our digital information could be stolen or tampered with or that our business operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe maintain systems designed to prevent such intrusion, tampering, and theft, and we continue to enhance and update these technologies as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. We also obtain assurances from outsourced service providers regarding the sufficiency of their security procedures and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify such an incident in a timely manner or at all, and in advance of it impacting the Company, and any such impact could be material. Further, our costs to maintain and upgrade our security systems could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats increase.\nDespite these efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering, and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. We have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as \"phishing\" attacks, business email compromises, employee or insider error, brute force attacks, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, and similar incidents. To date these incidents have not had a material impact on our business, but there can be no assurance that future incidents will not cause material impacts. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the actions we and our outsourced providers take will prevent a breach of, or attack on the information technology systems which support the day-to-day operation of our business or house our confidential, proprietary and personally identifiable information.\nAny such intrusion, tampering or theft (and any resulting disclosure or use of confidential, proprietary and personally identifiable information) could compromise our network, the network or data center of a third-party hosting key operating systems or data, or to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, or a third-party cloud service provider. Any of these impacts could result in a disruption to our information technology infrastructure, interruption of our business operations, violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of any insurance coverage (including legal claims and proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions and penalties), increased operating costs associated with remediation activities, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could harm our reputation with our customers, end-users, employees and other stakeholders\nand materially and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover these losses.\nIn the event a significant cybersecurity event is detected, we maintain disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to enable us to promptly analyze the impact on our business, respond expediently, appropriately and effectively and repair any damage caused by such incident, as well as consider whether such incident should be disclosed publicly. The Company also employs technology designed to detect potential incidents of intrusion, tampering and theft before they impact the Company and continues to enhance and update these technologies. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify such an incident in a timely manner or at all, and in advance of it impacting the Company, and any such impact could be material.\nMerger and Acquisition Risks\nOur strategy is partially based on growth through acquisitions. Failure to properly identify, value and manage acquisitions may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes continued focus on mergers and acquisitions. We may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, obtaining financing, or completing proposed acquisitions. In addition, an acquisition may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow. If we fail to effectively identify, value, consummate, or manage any acquired company, we may not achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of its acquisition. An acquisition could also adversely impact our operating performance or cash flow due to the seasonality of the target's business, the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, undisclosed facts about the business, expenses incurred to consummate the acquisition, increases in amortization due to the acquisition, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\nWe may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition, including the planned synergies.\nWe may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges may include, among other things: difficulties or delays in integrating or consolidating business activities; challenges with integrating the business cultures; difficulties in retaining key employees and key customers; and difficulties integrating the acquired business's finance, accounting, information technology and other business systems with our own. The process of integrating operations also could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses due to the considerable time and attention needed for the process. If we are not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result thereof, our business and financial results could suffer.\nWe generally expect that we will realize synergies, including cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. Our success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations of the acquired company. We cannot predict with certainty if or when these synergy savings and other benefits will occur, or the extent to which we will be successful.\nThe integration of any acquisition will involve changes to or implementation of critical information technology systems, modifications to our internal control systems, processes and accounting and financial systems, and the establishment of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting necessary to meet our obligations as a public company. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks and accurately report our financial results in a timely manner and establish internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures that are effective, our business, results of operations and financial condition, investor, supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information, the market perception of our Company and/or the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Allocation Risks\nOur existing borrowing arrangements limit our ability to engage in certain activities and require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to debt payments. If we are contractually restricted from pursuing activities or transactions that we believe are in our long-term best interests or are unable to meet our obligations under our loan agreements, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe terms of our debt agreements limit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may be in our and our stockholders' long-term interests. Among other things, the covenants and financial ratios and tests contained in our debt agreements restrict or limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant certain liens on our assets, issue preferred stock or certain disqualified stock, make restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases), make investments, sell our assets or merge with other companies, and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain circumstances and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants and financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to continue to meet those covenants, ratios and tests.\nOur debt service obligations require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and product development efforts, potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations, including our financial covenants, and to refinance our existing indebtedness upon maturity, will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business, and other factors. Breach of any of the covenants, ratios, and tests contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, or our inability to pay interest on, or principal of, our outstanding debt as it becomes due, could result in an event of default, in which case our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If our lenders accelerate our indebtedness, or we are not able to refinance our debts at maturity, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of such acceleration. If we then are unable to obtain replacement financing or any such replacement financing is on terms that are less favorable than the indebtedness being replaced, our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends at historic rates, or at all, or engage in stock repurchases.\nWe have a history of paying quarterly dividends and engaging in stock repurchase programs; however, any determination to continue to pay cash dividends at recent rates or at all, or resume repurchasing our shares in the market, is contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our board of directors' continuing determination that such dividends or share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements. Under certain circumstances, the terms of our debt agreements limit our ability to return capital to stockholders through stock repurchases, dividends or otherwise. There is no assurance that we will continue to make dividend payments or repurchase stock at recent historical levels or at all.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nProduct liability claims, recalls or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or brands.\nClaims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by one of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. The risk of litigation or regulatory enforcement actions and the associated costs and potential for monetary judgments and penalties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, product liability claims or regulatory actions, regardless of merit, could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or the value of our brands. We also may be, and, in the past have been, required to recall and discontinue the sale of allegedly defective or unsafe products, which has resulted in lost sales and unplanned expenses. Any future recall or quality issue could result in lost sales, adverse publicity, significant expenses, and adversely impact our results of operations or financial position.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\nWe are party to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings, primarily related to alleged patent infringement, as well as other claims incidental to our business. In addition, we may be unaware of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands, or products, and we may face other claims related to business operations. Any\nlitigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products.\nIt is the opinion of management that (other than the Brazil Tax Assessments described below) the ultimate resolution of currently outstanding matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters or that an adverse outcome in any matter will not affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow. Further, future claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn connection with our May 1, 2012, acquisition of the Mead Consumer and Office Products business, we assumed all of the tax liabilities for the acquired foreign operations including Tilibra Produtos de Papelaria Ltda. (\"Tilibra\"). In December of 2012, the Federal Revenue Department of the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (\"FRD\") issued a tax assessment against Tilibra, challenging the tax deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the year 2007 (the \"First Assessment\"). A second assessment challenging the deduction of goodwill from Tilibra's taxable income for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 was issued by FRD in October 2013 (the \"Second Assessment\" and together with the First Assessment, the \"Brazil Tax Assessments\"). Tilibra is disputing both of the Brazil Tax Assessments. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest both of the Brazil Tax Assessments; however, there can be no assurances that we will ultimately prevail. The ultimate outcome will not be determined until the Brazilian tax appeal process is complete, which is expected to take a number of years. If the FRD's initial position is ultimately sustained, payment of the amount assessed would materially and adversely affect our cash flow in the year of settlement.\nLaws, rules and regulations and self-regulatory requirements that affect our business, including the costs of compliance, as well as the impact of changes in such laws, could materially adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to national, state, provincial and/or local laws, rules and regulations, as well as self-regulatory requirements, in numerous countries due to the nature of our operations and the products we sell. Among others, laws and self-regulatory requirements in the following significant areas (and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) affect our business and our current and prospective customers\u2019 expectations:\n\u2022Laws relating to the discharge and emission of certain materials and waste, and laws establishing standards for their use, disposal, and management;\n\u2022Laws governing the content of toxic chemicals and materials in the products we sell;\n\u2022Laws regulating wellness products, including pesticides and pesticide devices;\n\u2022Product safety laws;\n\u2022International trade laws, including tariffs, trade sanctions and embargoes;\n\u2022Tax laws;\n\u2022Privacy and data security laws and self-regulatory requirements regarding the acceptance, processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data;\n\u2022Laws governing fair competition and marketing and advertising; and\n\u2022Anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws.\nAll of these legal frameworks are complex and change frequently. Capital and operating expenses required to establish and maintain compliance with all of these laws, rules and regulations and self-regulatory requirements can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines, penalties, and civil damages as well as damage to our reputation. In addition, as we continue to expand our business into emerging and new markets and into new product categories, we increase the number of legal and self-regulatory requirements with which we are required to comply, which increases the complexity and costs of compliance as well as the risks of noncompliance. Any significant increase in our costs to comply with applicable legal and self-regulatory requirements, or any liability arising from noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our future results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in these laws. Changes in income tax laws could change our effective tax rate while changes in U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on imports from China and on commodities we use in our manufacturing operations, could affect our cost of products sold and margins.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel at all levels and maintain a diverse, global workforce. The market for talent is currently extremely competitive and our current pay and benefits packages may not be sufficiently attractive. For our executives, we rely to a significant degree on performance-based incentive awards that pay out only if specified performance goals have been met. To the extent these performance goals are not met, and our incentive awards do not pay out, or pay out less than the targeted amount, it may motivate certain executive officers and more senior management employees to seek other opportunities. Our ability to maintain competitive pay and benefits and an attractive culture will affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of key management personnel or other employees with highly sought-after expertise or our potential inability to attract qualified and diverse personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our business needs may adversely affect our ability to manage our overall operations and successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile historically. Our stock price may be significantly affected by factors, including those described elsewhere in this \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" as well as the following:\n\u2022quarterly fluctuations in our operating results compared with market expectations;\n\u2022investors' perceptions of the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022the composition of our stockholders, particularly the presence of \"short sellers\" or high frequency traders trading in our stock.\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities, which could hurt our operating results and reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders.\nCircumstances outside our control, including telecommunication failures, labor strikes, power and/or water shortages, acts of God, public health crises, including the occurrence of contagious disease, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, war, terrorism, and other geopolitical incidents could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nA disruption at one of our suppliers' manufacturing facilities, one of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, or elsewhere in our global supply chain due to circumstances outside our control could adversely impact production and our customer deliveries, which may negatively impact our operations and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including but not limited to, major equipment failure, labor stoppages, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods, unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, civil unrest, fire, explosions, public health crises, including the occurrence of contagious disease such as COVID-19, war or terrorism, and disruptions in utility and other services. Any such disruptions could materially and adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPolitical instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, public health crises, including the occurrence of contagious diseases such as COVID-19, and severe weather or natural disasters may also affect consumer and business confidence and the health of the economies in the countries in which we operate. Overall, adverse changes in economic conditions or sustained periods of economic uncertainty or weakness in one or more of the geographic markets in which we operate, whatever the cause, have negatively affected our historical sales and profitability and, in the future, could have an adverse effect on our sales, business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90825, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "ACCO"}
