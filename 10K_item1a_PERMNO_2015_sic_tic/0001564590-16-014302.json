You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other periodic and current reports and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have never had any products available for commercial sale and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, are not profitable, have incurred losses in each year since our inception and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future. We have never had any products available for commercial sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales nor do we anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales in the near future. Our revenue to date has been collaboration revenue under the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, which was terminated in April 2015. As a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, Teva will no longer be responsible for custirsen-related expenses, and we will not receive additional revenue from Teva other than the advanced reimbursement payment for custirsen-related expenses we received in connection with the termination of the Collaboration Agreement. We have not yet submitted any products for approval by regulatory authorities, and we continue to incur research and development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research activities and conduct development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and prepare for and begin to commercialize any approved products. If our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if our product candidates do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nClinical trials may not demonstrate a clinical benefit of our product candidates.\nPositive results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including any exploratory results from the custirsen or apatorsen clinical trials conducted to date should not be relied on as evidence that on-going, amended, or later-stage or large-scale clinical trials will succeed. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale.\nSuccess in early clinical trials does not mean that future clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies, despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. Further, preliminary results from our clinical trials may not be confirmed in final data, or may change materially.\nEven after the completion of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials, regulatory agencies may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data, and may require us to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of our product candidates.\nWe have amended some of our ongoing clinical trials to incorporate preliminary observations from our other completed clinical trials. These observations may not be applicable to other stages of disease, or in combination with other therapies or indications. In planning or completing amendments to our trials, the statistical requirements to demonstrate success have been increased. This is due to including fewer patients for the primary evaluation and/or due to allowing for the chance of success to be determined in either of two primary evaluations, rather than only having one primary evaluation specified. Accordingly, if the observations from other completed trials are applied as amendments to our ongoing trials but prove not to be applicable to our ongoing trials, the results might indicate that our original trial design would have been successful if the changes had not been made to the original statistical requirements. We may choose to make additional amendments to ongoing studies for any reason including to analyze final top line data earlier than planned. Any future amendments may compromise the integrity of the clinical trial results and may not be acceptable to regulators.\nWe are highly dependent on the success of our lead product candidates, custirsen and apatorsen, and we cannot give any assurance that they, or any of our other product candidates, will receive regulatory approval or will be successfully commercialized.\nIn order to market custirsen, we must, among other things, complete ongoing clinical trials, including phase 3 or registration clinical trials, to demonstrate safety and efficacy. In April 2014, we announced that top-line survival results from our phase 3 SYNERGY trial indicated that the addition of custirsen to standard first-line docetaxel/prednisone therapy did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic CRPC, compared to docetaxel/prednisone alone. Our protocol amendments, including but not limited to revisions to statistical analysis plans, or inclusion of analyses on poor prognostic patients, may be approved by regulatory authorities on a country-by-country basis slower than we anticipate, or not at all. We may decide not to continue to advance the development and commercialization of custirsen, which would harm or prevent the commercialization of this product candidate. The failure to further develop and eventually commercialize custirsen could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nCompleting additional clinical trials will be required for apatorsen to establish the safety and efficacy of this product candidate. In September 2015, we announced that the addition of apatorsen to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine did not demonstrate a survival benefit compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone. Additionally, in January 2016, we announced that data from the phase 2 Spruce trial evaluating the combination of apatorsen with carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC did not reach the statistical significance required to demonstrate a PFS benefit. We are conducting parallel clinical trials to evaluate apatorsen in several cancer indications and treatment combinations. The failure of apatorsen to be shown safe or effective in one or more indications could negatively impact the development of apatorsen in other indications and could result in the suspension or termination of our apatorsen development plans.\nOGX-225 has not been tested in humans. Our preclinical testing of this product candidate may not be favorable and we may not be able to clinically evaluate OGX-225.\nOur clinical development programs for our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval either if such product candidates fail to demonstrate that they are safe and effective in clinical trials and consequently fail to obtain necessary approvals from the regulatory agencies, or if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance these product candidates through the clinical trial process. If competitive products developed by third parties show significant benefit in the cancer indications in which we are developing our product candidates, any planned supportive or primary registration trials may be delayed, altered or not initiated and custirsen, apatorsen and our other product candidates may never receive regulatory approval. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of custirsen, apatorsen or our other product candidates could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our product candidates and other agents used in our clinical trials and potential future commercial use. A decrease in the availability or quality of any of these products or agents could increase clinical trial costs, delay or halt clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our future product candidates, resulting in additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, and we depend on third-party contract manufacturers for production of all of our product candidates and rely on other companies and their manufacturers for other agents used in all of our clinical trials. We lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates ourselves. To date, our product candidates have been manufactured in limited quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. All active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and drug product for custirsen and apatorsen have been manufactured for us by third parties pursuant to a purchase order or short-term contract that has been fulfilled.\nPrior to the termination of our collaboration agreement with Teva, Teva manufactured custirsen drug product and, pursuant to the Termination Agreement, it has discontinued such activities. In addition to the selection of a new drug product supplier, we will require technology and methods transfer, validation processes and stability data in order to manufacture drug product. These activities, results and associated regulatory requirements may delay our ability to submit our application for market approval, if applicable. We cannot provide assurance that we will find a new manufacturer of drug product whose terms or timing would be acceptable to us and we may not have sufficient resources to commence certain activities as soon as required. As a result, we could experience a significant delays in custirsen\u2019s development and potential future commercialization.\nIf, in the future, one of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we, or a pharmaceutical partner that has licensed such product candidate, may need to manufacture that product candidate in commercial quantities. We cannot provide assurance that the third-party manufacturers with which we have contracted in the past will have sufficient capacity to satisfy our future manufacturing needs, that we will be able to negotiate additional purchases of API or drug product from these or alternative manufacturers on terms favorable to us, if at all, or that a pharmaceutical partner that has licensed such product candidate will have sufficient capacity or expertise to satisfy future needs.\nThird-party manufacturers may fail to perform under their contractual obligations, or may fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk API or finished drug product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. We have experienced manufacturing quality issues resulting in an unusable lot of product candidate in the past. Any performance failure on the part of our contract manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting in additional losses. If we are required to identify and qualify an alternate manufacturer, we may be forced to delay or suspend our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, which may cause us to incur higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully. If we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a reasonably favorable cost, in adequate volumes, of adequate quality and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our product candidates and our clinical trials could be delayed or we could lose potential revenue. Our ability to replace an existing API manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited to approximately five manufacturers, and regulatory agencies must inspect any replacement manufacturer and review information related to product produced at the manufacturer before they can begin manufacturing our product candidates. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, if at all. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future.\nOur product candidates require precise, high-quality manufacturing. Any of our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by regulatory agencies to ensure strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding standards. If our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP regulations, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously affect our business.\nSignificant manufacturing scale-up may require additional validation studies, which the regulatory agencies must review and approve. Additionally, any third-party manufacturers we retain to manufacture our product candidates on a commercial scale must pass regulatory agencies\u2019 pre-approval inspection for conformance to cGMP regulations before we can obtain approval of our product candidates. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate in conformance with cGMP regulations, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any related products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply.\nWe also rely on third-parties for the provision of other agents used in our clinical trials, and in some circumstances these agents are provided to us at no cost. We have no assurance that these third-parties will continue to provide their products to us at no cost.\nThe termination of our Collaboration Agreement with Teva has resulted in us being required to take over responsibility for conducting the ongoing custirsen trials, and further development and commercialization of custirsen will require significant resources from us or another collaborator.\nIn April 2015, we and Teva entered into a Termination Agreement, pursuant to which we terminated our Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, we received approximately $23.2 million as advanced reimbursement for custirsen-related development activities and regained all rights to custirsen and responsibility for all custirsen-related expenses as of January 1, 2015, including those related to the ENSPIRIT trial, as well as manufacturing and regulatory activities for the custirsen programs, which were previously managed and funded by Teva. Of the advance reimbursement received, we have incurred approximately $18.2 million for certain custirsen-related development costs between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. As a result, Teva transitioned the responsibilities associated with conducting the ongoing custirsen clinical trials to us.\nAdditionally, further development of custirsen will require significant resources from us or another collaborator. We will not receive any future cash reimbursements from Teva for costs incurred by us in connection with the clinical development of custirsen, and we are required to fund all future development and commercialization ourselves if we are unable to find another collaborator. We expect that the $23.2 million payment from Teva as advanced reimbursement for custirsen-related development activities, along with our existing capital resources, will allow for the completion and final results from the AFFINITY and ENSPIRIT trials, but we will need to acquire additional capital or enter into a new partnership or collaboration agreement to fund additional development or commercialization. There are no assurances that we will have access to additional capital or find a new collaborator, or that the terms and timing of any such arrangements would be acceptable to us. As a result, we could experience a significant delay in the custirsen development process. If we determine to discontinue the development of custirsen, or any ongoing clinical trials, we would not receive any future return on our investment from that product candidate, or a specific indication.\nBecause we depend on financing from third parties for our operations, our business may fail if such financing becomes unavailable or is not available on commercially reasonable terms.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and from payments we received pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement with Teva. In April 2015, our Collaboration Agreement with Teva was terminated, and we will not receive any future payments from Teva. We believe that our existing capital resources and interest on such resources will be sufficient to meet our current operating requirements into the third quarter of 2017. However, if patients live longer as a result of new or investigational therapies, the trials proceed slower or take longer than expected to complete, or are initiated later than expected, we change our development plans, acquire rights to new product candidates, cannot find third-party collaborators for our other product candidates, do not successfully defend pending litigation or engage in commercialization and product launch activities, we will need additional capital sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe scope and results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n\u00b7\nwhether we experience delays in our clinical and preclinical development programs, or experience slower-than-anticipated product development or rate of events;\n\u00b7\nwhether we are able to enter into additional third-party collaborative partnerships to develop and/or commercialize any of our other product candidates on terms that are acceptable to us;\n\u00b7\nour ability to forecast the cost of our ongoing development activities, including the ENSPIRIT trial;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and requirements of, and the costs involved in, making protocol amendments to any of our ongoing studies prior to their completion and conducting studies required to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates from regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of third parties to perform the key development tasks for our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing our product candidates to be tested in those studies and trials and the associated costs of those services;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending the validity of and enforcing patent claims and other costs related to patent rights and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u00b7\nwhether we modify our development program, including terminating and starting new trials;\n\u00b7\nwhether opportunities to acquire additional product candidates arise and the costs of acquiring and developing those product candidates;\n\u00b7\nwhether we engage in commercialization and product launch activities; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs to defend, and the results of, pending litigation.\nIf we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms when it becomes necessary to do so, we may not be able to continue developing our product candidates, acquire or develop additional product candidates or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. For these reasons, any inability to raise additional funds when we require it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may fail to achieve the expected financial and operating benefits of our plan to reduce operating expenses and the plan may harm our business and financial results.\nIn February 2016, we announced a plan to reduce operating expenses, which included a workforce reduction of 11 employees, representing approximately 27% of our employees prior to the reduction. We face significant risks associated with this plan that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated savings and operational efficiencies or that may otherwise harm our business. These risks include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, loss of workforce capabilities, decreases in employee focus and morale, attrition of necessary or key employees, higher than anticipated separation expenses, litigation and the failure to meet financial and operational targets. In addition, the calculation of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits resulting from our plan to reduce operating expenses are subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if we experience delays or unforeseen events, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely, in part, on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and plan to rely on third parties to conduct future clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our current and future product candidates.\nTo implement our product development strategies, we rely on third parties, such as collaborators, contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our development plan and protocol. Moreover, regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the clinical trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines or need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to GCPs or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. In addition, a failure by such third parties to perform their obligations in compliance with GCPs may cause our clinical trials to fail to meet regulatory requirements, which may require us to repeat our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time, including by regulatory agencies, a Data Safety Monitoring Board overseeing the clinical trial at issue, by a clinical trial site or investigator, or by us. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could materially harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe do not know whether any of our currently planned or on-going clinical trials for custirsen or apatorsen will proceed or be completed on schedule, if at all, or, with respect to our other product candidates, whether we will be able to initiate any future preclinical studies or clinical trials, as applicable, beyond those currently planned. The completion of our clinical trials currently in progress could also be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain required future additional funding, when needed, through private or public offerings of our equity securities, debt financings, or the execution of a licensing, partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party for any of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nlack of efficacy evidenced during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ninadequate evidence of clinical benefit or futility;\n\u00b7\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment, enrollment and final analysis;\n\u00b7\nfailure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7\ntermination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites, investigators, data safety monitoring boards, or regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow clinical trial protocols;\n\u00b7\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of competitive products that may impede our ability to retain patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient manufacturing supply of custirsen or apatorsen; and\n\u00b7\ndelay in submission or acceptance of protocol amendments.\nThe completion or commencement of future preclinical studies or clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain required future additional funding, when needed, through private or public offerings of our equity securities, debt financings, or the execution of a licensing, partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party for any of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient manufacturing supply of custirsen, apatorsen or other products necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable patients with the particular types of cancer required for enrollment in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new product candidates to the market in therapeutic areas similar to those that we are developing for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nconcurrent evaluation of new investigational product candidates in therapeutic areas similar to those that we are developing for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain regulatory agencies\u2019 approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial, including our phase 3 or registration clinical trials or amendment of those trials;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies, including comparator drug, for our clinical trials; delay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or investigators;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure to obtain the approval of the Institutional Review Board to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; and\n\u00b7\nour decision to alter the development strategy for one or more clinical or preclinical products.\nWe may seek to partner with third-party collaborators with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and we cannot control whether we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur business strategy relies in part on potentially partnering successful product candidates with larger companies to complement our internal development and commercialization efforts. We will be competing with many other companies as we seek partners for our product candidates and may not be able to compete successfully against those companies. If we are not able to enter into collaboration arrangements for our product candidates, we would be required to undertake and fund further development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense and risk. If we are unable to finance and/or successfully execute those expensive activities, or we delay such activities due to capital availability, our business could be materially and adversely affected, and potential future product launch could be materially delayed, be less successful, or we may be forced to discontinue clinical development of these product candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable and potentially serious side effects during clinical trials that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nSince patients in our clinical trials have advanced stages of cancer, we expect that additional adverse events, including serious adverse events, will occur.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by regulatory agencies for any or all targeted indications or decrease the competitive opportunity of the product candidate which may decrease sales potential. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenue from their sale. In addition, if our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:\n\u00b7\nwe may elect to terminate the ongoing clinical trials and cease development of the product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u00b7\na product may become less competitive and product sales may decrease; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of the product. Historic events have raised questions about the safety of marketed drugs and may result in increased cautiousness by regulatory agencies in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, additional clinical trials being required, or more stringent product labeling requirements. Any delay in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we were to be successfully sued related to our products or operations, we could face substantial liabilities that may exceed our resources.\nWe may be held liable if any of our products or operations cause injury or death or are found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. These risks are inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. We currently maintain commercial general and umbrella liability policies with combined limits of $10.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, in addition to a $10.0 million per claim and annual aggregate product liability insurance policy related to our clinical trials consistent with industry standards. When necessary for our products, we intend to obtain additional product liability insurance. Insurance coverage may be prohibitively expensive, may not fully cover potential liabilities or may not be available in the future. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. If we were to be sued for any injury caused by or associated with our products or operations, the litigation could consume substantial time and attention of our management, and the resulting liability could exceed our total assets.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our future product candidates, our clinical trials and commercial opportunities will be negatively affected.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address cancer indications for which we are currently developing products or for which we may develop products in the future. We are aware of several other companies that are developing therapeutics that seek to promote tumor cell death. Several therapies have been recently approved by the FDA, and we expect more to be approved in the future.\nSome of our product candidates\u2019 development plans include pursuing prostate and lung cancer indications. Substantial advancements in the treatment of prostate and lung cancer have occurred in the past two years and new products from our competitors have been approved for marketing on the basis of showing a survival advantage. Any products we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are, or may become, active in cancer research, and develop products that may directly compete with ours. If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our future product candidates, if any, or that reach the market sooner than our future product candidates, if any, we may not achieve commercial success.\nIf new therapies become broadly used, we may need to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates in combination with these new therapies to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the combination. Additional trials will delay the development of our product candidates and increase our costs. The failure of certain of our product candidates to work in combination with these new therapies would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur intention is to combine certain of our product candidates with therapies that are broadly used by clinicians and considered highly effective. As new therapies are developed, we will need to assess these therapies to determine whether to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates in combination with them to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the combination. If we determine that it is appropriate to conduct additional clinical trials of our product candidates in combination with these new therapies, the development of our product candidates will be delayed and our costs will be increased. If these clinical trials generate safety concerns or lack of efficacy, our business would be adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our products.\nEven if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and/or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7\nsafety and efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7\npotential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nstrength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nprice of our products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\navailability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors; and\n\u00b7\nsequencing of available products.\nIf our future product candidates fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe will need to retain additional personnel and expand our other resources in order to develop our other product candidates. If we fail to effectively expand our operations, including attracting and retaining key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development, commercialization and other resources in order to successfully pursue our development and commercialization efforts for our existing and future product candidates. In connection with the termination of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, we took on additional management activities such as regulatory, drug supply and pharmacovigilance that was previously managed by Teva. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, such as management, clinical and preclinical personnel, including our executive officers Scott Cormack, John Bencich and Cindy Jacobs. In addition, although we have entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Cormack, Mr. Bencich and Dr. Jacobs, such agreements permit the executive to terminate his or her employment with us at any time, subject to providing us with advance written notice.\nShould custirsen receive marketing approval in the United States, Canada, or elsewhere in the world, we would need to hire a substantial number of specialized personnel, including field-based medical affairs representatives. In turn, we would need to increase our administrative headcount to support such expanded development and commercialization operations with respect to our product candidates. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future is subject to intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses and our current financial position. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or have other adverse effects on our business for an indefinite term. In particular, if we lose any members of our current senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our expected growth and in expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through development, we will need to develop or expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development efforts effectively, manage our clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional management, development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nFurthermore, we may acquire additional businesses, products or product candidates that complement or augment our existing business. Integrating any newly acquired business, product or product candidate could be expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to integrate any acquired business, product or product candidate successfully or operate any acquired business profitably. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively and our ability to integrate any acquired businesses. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, which failure could prevent us from successfully growing our business.\nIf we fail to acquire and develop products or product candidates at all or on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to grow our business.\nWe currently do not have internal discovery capabilities and depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license products or product candidates to us. To date, three of our product candidates have been derived from technologies discovered by the Vancouver Prostate Centre and licensed to us by UBC. We intend to continue to rely on research institutions and other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies as sources of product candidates. We cannot guarantee that the Vancouver Prostate Centre or UBC will continue to develop new product candidate opportunities, that we will continue to have access to such opportunities or that we will be able to purchase or license these product candidates on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to purchase or license new product candidates from the Vancouver Prostate Centre or UBC, we will be required to identify alternative sources of product candidates.\nThe success of our product pipeline strategy depends on our ability to identify, select and acquire pharmaceutical product candidates. Proposing, negotiating and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. We compete for partnering arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic research institutions. Our competitors may have stronger relationships with third parties with whom we are interested in collaborating and/or may have more established histories of developing and commercializing products. As a result, our competitors may have a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with such third parties. In addition, even if we find promising product candidates, and generate interest in a partnering or strategic arrangement to acquire such product candidates, we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we find acceptable, if at all. If we fail to acquire and develop product candidates from others, we may be unable to grow our business.\nWe expect that any product candidate that we acquire rights to will require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical evaluation and approval by regulatory agencies. All product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. Even if the product candidates are approved, we can make no assurance that we would be capable of economically producing the product or that the product would be commercially successful.\nWe may be adversely affected if our controls over financial reporting fail or are circumvented.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. If it were to be determined that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, such shortcoming could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and the price of our common stock could be negatively affected. This reporting requirement could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulation concerning control and procedures could have a material effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Any of these events could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could negatively affect the market price of our shares, increase the volatility of our stock price and adversely affect our ability to raise additional funding. The effect of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board and our Board committees and as executive officers.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.\nOur commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents and/or regulatory exclusivity and maintain adequate protection for our technologies and product candidates in the United States and other countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and future product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nWe and our collaborators intend to apply for additional patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. We or our collaborators may, however, fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, if at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we or our collaborators obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. In addition, we do not always control the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others. Accordingly, we are sometimes unable to exercise a significant degree of control over such intellectual property as we would over our own.\nMoreover, the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the revised standards. Some of our patents or those of our collaborators may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a re-examination proceeding, or during litigation, under the revised criteria. We cannot guarantee that:\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaboration partners will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties; and\n\u00b7\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable, or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends on many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. Our ability or the ability of our collaborators to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us or our collaborators, may be challenged, invalidated, unenforceable or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where it is believed that patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or our collaboration partners\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors. For example, under our Termination Agreement with Teva, Teva is not permitted to use our confidential information which would include our trade secrets. We may not be able to adequately determine whether Teva uses any of our trade secrets and if they do, we may not be able to sufficiently enforce their non-use. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates and products, when and if we have any, in every jurisdiction would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products. These products may compete with our products, when and if we have any, and may not be covered by any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent claims or other intellectual property rights.\nThe laws of some non-U.S. countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nWe may become involved in disputes with past or potential future collaborators over intellectual property ownership, and publications by our research collaborators and scientific advisors could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant effect on our business.\nInventions discovered under research, material transfer or other such collaborative agreements may become jointly owned by us and the other party to such agreements in some cases and the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes could arise regarding ownership of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time consuming and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect or license rights to these inventions. In addition, our research collaborators and scientific advisors generally have contractual rights to publish our data and other proprietary information, subject to our prior review. Publications by our research collaborators and scientific advisors containing such information, either with our permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us, may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which could significantly harm our business.\nThe intellectual property protection for our product candidates depends on third parties.\nWith respect to custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225, we have exclusively licensed from UBC certain issued patents and pending patent applications covering the respective antisense sequences underlying these product candidates and their commercialization and use, and we have licensed from Ionis certain issued patents and pending patent applications directed to product compositions and chemical modifications used in product candidates for commercialization, use and the manufacturing thereof, as well as some alternative antisense sequences. We have also received a sublicense from Ionis under certain third-party patent portfolios directed to such modifications.\nThe patents and pending patent applications underlying our licenses do not cover all potential product candidates, modifications and uses. In the case of patents and patent applications licensed from Ionis, we do not have and have not had any control over the filing, prosecution or enforcement of these patents or patent applications. We cannot be certain that such prosecution efforts have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents. We also cannot be assured that our licensors or their respective licensing partners will agree to enforce any such patent rights at our request or devote sufficient efforts to attain a desirable result. Any failure by our licensors or any of their respective licensing partners to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to our product candidates or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. Certain of our license agreements may not provide an adequate remedy for a breach by the licensor.\nWe license the development and commercialization rights for most of our product candidates, including custirsen, apatorsen and OGX-225, and we expect to enter into similar licenses in the future. Under such licenses, we are subject to various obligations such as sublicensing, royalty and milestone payments, annual maintenance fees, limits on sublicensing, insurance obligations and the obligation to use commercially reasonable best efforts to develop and exploit the licensed technology. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach these agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license. We may also become involved in disputes with licensors regarding the meaning of certain terms in the license agreements, including terms related to royalty and milestone payments, which may result in costly and time consuming litigation. Loss of any of these licenses or the exclusivity rights provided by the licenses could harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of our license agreements with UBC eliminate our ability to obtain money damages in respect of certain claims against UBC.\nIf we are unable to successfully defend or settle our pending litigation with Ionis, we may be required to make a significant payment to Ionis and may lose certain development and commercialization rights related to our product candidates.\nDuring 2015, we received communications from Ionis requesting payment of 30% of the $23.2 million paid by Teva under the Termination Agreement, as well as 30% of any amounts paid by Teva upon release of the $3.0 million holdback amount. In January 2016, Ionis filed a lawsuit and claimed that OncoGenex Technologies is in breach of the license agreement with Ionis for failing to pay Ionis a share of the advance reimbursement payment from Teva and other non-monetary consideration received from Teva in connection with the termination of the Collaboration Agreement. Ionis seeks damages in the amount of at least $10 million and a declaratory judgment that, based on OncoGenex Technologies\u2019 alleged breach, Ionis has the right to terminate the license agreement. We do not, however, believe that any payments are due to Ionis. Under the Ionis license agreement, no payment is due to Ionis on any consideration that we receive for the reimbursement for research and development activities. The amounts paid or payable by Teva under the Termination Agreement constitute an advanced reimbursement for certain continuing research and development activities related to custirsen and certain other antisense inhibitors of clusterin, and therefore, no payments are owed to Ionis.\nLitigation is costly and time consuming, and may result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. If this litigation does not result in a successful outcome or we are otherwise unable to settle the dispute on acceptable terms, we may be required to pay Ionis a significant portion of the amounts that were paid by Teva, which may require us to revise our operating budget and clinical development plans, and delay or suspend clinical development. Ionis may also attempt to terminate the license agreement, which could result in our loss of certain development and commercialization rights relating to our product candidates and harm our ability to advance our product candidates.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates or products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs. For example, certain of the U.S. patents directed to custirsen and its use that have been licensed from UBC are scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021. In some of the larger economic territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension/restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product candidate\u2019s regulatory review. We cannot, however, be certain that an extension will be granted or, if granted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended period will be. In addition, even though some regulatory agencies may provide some other exclusivity for a product candidate under its own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product candidate or obtain the exclusive time period.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S. patents.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents or our licensed patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are invalid or unenforceable and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. The U.S. Supreme Court has revised certain tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents to make it more difficult to obtain patents. Some of our issued patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation under the revised criteria. There is also the risk that, even if the validity or unenforceability of these patents is upheld, the court will narrow the scope of our claim or will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights.\nIf we wish to use the technology or compound claimed in issued and unexpired patents owned by others, we will need to obtain a license from the owner, enter into litigation to challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents or incur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringed its patents. The failure to obtain a license to technology or the failure to challenge an issued patent that we may require to discover, develop or commercialize our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf a third party asserts that we infringed its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could seriously harm our results of operations, financial condition and competitive position, including:\n\u00b7\npatent infringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to defend, whether or not the claims have merit, and which could delay the regulatory approval process and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product candidates or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future drugs unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do; and\n\u00b7\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump-sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license.\nThe biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent, and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and/or that the patent is unenforceable and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nU.S. patent laws as well as the laws of some foreign jurisdictions provide for provisional rights in published patent applications beginning on the date of publication, including the right to obtain reasonable royalties, if a patent subsequently issues and certain other conditions are met.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our licensors\u2019 issued patents or our pending applications or our licensors\u2019 pending applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to invent the technology.\nPatent applications filed by third parties that cover technology similar to ours may have priority over our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party files a U.S. patent application on an invention similar to ours, we may elect to participate in or be drawn into an interference proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend against these claims, whether they are with or without any merit and whether they are resolved in favor of or against us or our licensors, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. As a result of these disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology, or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, or our employees or consultants, have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of third parties.\nMany of our employees were previously employed, and certain of our consultants are currently employed, at universities or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we have not received any claim to date, we may be subject to claims that these employees or consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these current or former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. We may be subject to claims that employees of our partners or licensors of technology licensed by us have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. We may become involved in litigation to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price for our common stock is volatile.\nThe market prices for our common stock and that of emerging life science companies generally have historically been highly volatile. For example, after the announcement of data from recent custirsen and apatorsen clinical trials, we experienced a significant decreases in our stock price. Future announcements concerning us, the results of our clinical trials or our competitors may also have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The stock markets also experience significant price and volume fluctuation unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAn increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable, may be the sole source of gain from an investment in our common stock. An investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for investors who require dividend income. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for stockholders for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, an investment in our common stock may not be appropriate for investors who require dividend income or investors who are not prepared to bear a significant risk of losses from such an investment.\nThe price of our common stock does not meet the requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum listing requirements, our common stock will be subject to delisting. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if our common stock is delisted.\nThe continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market require, among other things, that the minimum bid price of a listed company\u2019s stock be at or above $1.00. If the minimum bid price is below $1.00 for a period of more than 30 consecutive trading days, the listed company will fail to be in compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s listing rules and, if it does not regain compliance within the grace period, will be subject to delisting. As previously reported, on February 25, 2016, we received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department notifying us that for 30 consecutive trading days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement. In accordance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s listing rules, we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until August 23, 2016, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, the bid price of our common stock must close at a price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. If we fail to regain compliance, our common stock will be subject to delisting. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, including in circumstances where such declines occur in close proximity to the announcement of clinical trial results. This risk is especially relevant for us because our stock price and those of other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf we raise additional capital, the terms of the financing transactions may cause dilution to existing stockholders or contain terms that are not favorable to us.\nTo date, our sources of cash have been limited primarily to proceeds from the private or public placement of our securities and reimbursement for custirsen-related development expenses from our prior strategic collaboration with Teva, which terminated in April 2015. In the future, we may seek to raise additional financing through private placements or public offerings of our equity or debt securities. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional financing by issuing equity securities, we may do so at a price per share that represents a discount to the then-current per share trading price of our common stock and our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our stockholder rights plan, our charter documents and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nWe have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. Specifically, the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan could cause significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our Board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock and the ability of our Board to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. Collectively, these provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult or could discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThere is a high risk that our drug development activities will not result in commercial products.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of development and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. We will need to complete significant additional clinical trials before we can demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies. Clinical trials are expensive and uncertain processes that take years to complete. Failure can occur at any stage of the process, and successful early clinical trials do not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to show desired efficacy and safety traits despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. For example, in April 2014, we announced that top-line survival results indicated that the addition of custirsen to standard first-line docetaxel/prednisone therapy did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic CRPC, compared to docetaxel/prednisone alone. Additionally, in January 2016, we announced that data from the phase 2 Spruce trial evaluating the combination of apatorsen with carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC did not reach the statistical significance required to demonstrate a PFS benefit. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, a clinical trial may prove successful with respect to a secondary objective, but fail to demonstrate clinically significant benefits with respect to a primary objective. Failure to satisfy a primary objective in a phase 3 clinical trial (registration trial) would generally mean that a product candidate would not receive regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by regulatory agencies, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an application for market approval from regulatory agencies. We have not submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Obtaining approval of an application for market approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications for market approval or supplements to approved applications for market approval.\nRegulatory approval of an application for market approval or application for market approval supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. Regulatory agencies also has substantial discretion in the drug approval\nprocess. Even though we have received support for our protocol amendment to the AFFINITY trial, this does not guarantee that regulatory agencies will be supportive of an application for market approval. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that could cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory agencies\u2019 approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\na drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u00b7\nregulatory agencies may not find the data from preclinical studies and/or clinical trials sufficient;\n\u00b7\nregulatory agencies might not approve our third-party manufacturer\u2019s processes or facilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory agencies may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations; and\n\u00b7\nthird-party products may enter the market and change approval requirements.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our product candidates may limit how we manufacture and market our product candidates, which could materially affect our ability to generate revenue.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, the approved product and its manufacturer will be subject to continual review. Any regulatory approval that we receive for a product candidate is likely to be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the end product may be marketed, or include requirements for potentially costly post-approval follow-up clinical trials. In addition, if regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the end product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and the manufacturers of our products, when and if we have any, will also be required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, when and if we have any, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of regulatory agencies, or if previously unknown problems with our products, when and if we have any, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nwarning letters;\n\u00b7\ncivil or criminal penalties or fines;\n\u00b7\ninjunctions;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications for market approval or supplements to approved applications for market approval.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may change their policies and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States, Canada or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we would likely not be permitted to market our future product candidates and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our product candidates, our revenue and potential for profitability will be reduced.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, our product revenue will depend principally on the reimbursement rates established by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed-care providers, public health insurers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, and examining the cost-effectiveness, of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status, if any, of newly approved\ndrugs, pharmaceutical products or product indications. We may need to conduct post-marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products, if any. Such clinical trials may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. If reimbursement of such product is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our revenue could be reduced.\nIn some countries other than the United States, particularly the countries of the European Union and Canada, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, obtaining pricing approval from governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval of a product for an indication. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of one of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of such product candidate is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our revenue could be reduced.\nDomestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare, including drugs. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control. In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry.\nWe anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and downward pressure on the price for any approved product, and could seriously harm our prospects. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid program and state healthcare laws and regulations may also be modified to change the scope of covered products and/or reimbursement methodology. Cost control initiatives could decrease the established reimbursement rates that we receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products, including custirsen, or apatorsen may change at any time, which could further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for custirsen, apatorsen or other product candidates.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval outside of the United States and Canada would prevent us from marketing our product candidates abroad.\nWe intend to market certain of our existing and future product candidates outside of the United States and Canada. In order to market our existing and future product candidates in the European Union and many other non-North American markets, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had limited interactions with non-North American regulatory authorities. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-North American regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. The non-North American regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain non-North American regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for non-North American regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our existing and future product candidates in any market.", "PERMNO": 82526, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACHV"}
