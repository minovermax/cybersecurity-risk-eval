{"cik": "1421461", "company": "Intrepid Potash, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors. Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur evaluation and assessment of potential strategic alternatives may not result in a strategic transaction on favorable terms or at all, and any strategic transaction may not be successful.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, in December 2016 we engaged Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., a nationally-recognized investment bank, to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate. These potential strategic alternatives could include, but are not limited to, continuing our current operating plan, equity offerings or balance sheet restructurings, merger and acquisition opportunities, partnership or joint venture opportunities, entering into new or complementary businesses, or a sale of Intrepid or some or all of our assets.\nThere can be no assurance that this evaluation will result in any transaction. We have not set a timetable for the completion of the strategic review process. Our evaluation and assessment of potential strategic alternatives may not result in a strategic transaction on favorable terms or at all. Our management team and other employees may be required to spend a significant amount of time addressing potential strategic alternatives, which could mean that our normal operations receive less time and attention.\nIn addition, if our Board approves a specific action, it may not have the desired effect or otherwise be successful.\nWe may alter or expand our operations to include more by-products and non-potassium-related products, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage any expansion effectively.\nWe are in the process of implementing or considering a number of initiatives designed to maximize the value of our existing assets, such as through increased production and sales of salt, water, and brine. In addition, we may enter into new or complementary businesses that expand our product offerings beyond our existing assets. For example, we may expand into oil, natural gas, or other commodities or into products or services up or down the supply chain in our current or new industries. We may not be able to successfully implement any alteration or expansion initiatives. Further, we may not be able to fully realize any anticipated benefits of these initiatives. Any expansion initiatives may require significant capital investments and those investments may not produce the expected benefits. Any of these items could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe have outstanding $129.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also have an asset-based revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to an additional $35 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The agreements governing the senior notes and credit facility restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to borrow additional money or sell additional shares of common stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements\n\u2022\nit could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business\n\u2022\nwe could be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy\n\u2022\nit could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes\n\u2022\nit could adversely affect our business and financial condition if we default on or are unable to service our indebtedness or are unable to obtain additional financing, as needed\nOur debt agreements contain financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the agreements include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum level of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other expenses, as defined under the agreements) and require us to meet specified leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios beginning in 2018. Also, the interest rates under the notes are adjusted quarterly, and we may be subject to additional interest in the future based on our financial performance and certain financial covenant levels.\nFor more information about these financial covenants, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nThese covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. The senior notes and credit facility are variously secured by substantially all of our assets. As such, an event of default could also result in our lenders foreclosing on some or all of our assets.\nThe credit facility expires in 2018 and the senior notes are due in 2020, 2023, and 2025. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\nOver the past year, we have spent significant time and money negotiating revisions to our financial covenants under our debt agreements. We were not in compliance with the financial covenants under our previous debt agreements as of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, or September 30, 2016. We entered into a series of waivers and ultimately entered into revised and new debt agreements to resolve the issues. These revised and new agreements contained, among other requirements, more stringent financial covenants, higher interest rates, and a requirement that we engage a nationally-recognized investment bank to assess, evaluate, and assist in pursuing potential strategic alternatives available to us, as we determine to be appropriate.\nOur potash sales are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe market for potash is cyclical, and the prices and demand for potash can fluctuate significantly. Periods of high demand, increasing profits, and high-capacity utilization lead to new plant investment and increased production. This growth continues until the market is over-saturated, leading to decreased prices and lower-capacity utilization until the cycle repeats. Through the first half of 2016, we continued to experience an oversupplied market with declining prices. Also, individual potash producers have, at times, independently suspended production in response to market outlook. As a result of these various factors, the prices and demand for potash can be volatile. This volatility can reduce profit margins and negatively affect our results of operations. We sell the majority of our potash into the spot market in the U.S. In addition, there is no active hedge market for potash as compared to many other commodities. As a result, we do not have protection from this price and demand volatility.\nWe are working to expand our international sales of Trio\u00ae, and our sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in our plans.\nPart of our strategy is to expand our sales of Trio\u00ae outside of the United States. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful, which would temper any Trio\u00ae sales growth. It is difficult to determine if or how any expanded international demand and pricing for Trio\u00ae will develop. Our international sales may result in lower gross margins than domestic sales due to higher costs. These costs could include higher transportation costs, importation costs, and costs associated with duties, trade requirements, or other import or export control laws and regulations. In addition, we could face increased price pressure and competition in some international markets where substitutes are more prevalent. Any of these items could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, as we expand our international sales program, these sales may occur on an irregular basis, which could cause volatility in our inventories and our results of operations.\nInternational sales could present risks to our business.\nAs discussed above, we are working to grow our international sales of Trio\u00ae. Participating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and may subject us to economic, regulatory, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. These risks include accounts receivable collection; the need to adapt marketing and sales efforts for specific countries; new and different sources of competition; disputes and losses associated with overseas shipping; tariffs, export controls, and trade duties; additional time and effort to obtain product certifications; adverse tax consequences; restrictions on the transfer of funds; changes in legal and regulatory requirements or import policies; compliance with potentially unfamiliar local laws and customs; and political and economic instability. International sales may also be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside the United States and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Certain international markets require significant time and effort on the part of management to develop relationships and gain market acceptance for our products. Overall, there are additional logistical requirements associated with international sales, which may increase the time between production and our ability to recognize related revenue. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business.\nAggressive pricing or operating strategies by other potash producers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe potash industry is concentrated, with a small number of producers accounting for the majority of global production. Many of these producers have significantly larger operations and more resources than we do. These larger producers may have greater leverage in pricing negotiations with customers and transportation providers. They may also be able to mine their potash at a lower cost due to economies of scale or other competitive advantages. In addition, they may decide to pursue aggressive pricing or operating strategies that disrupt the global and U.S. potash markets. These disruptions could cause lower prices or demand for our product, which would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nChanges in the agricultural industry could exacerbate the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products or adversely affect the markets for our products.\nFarmers attempt to apply the optimum amounts of fertilizer to maximize their economic returns. A farmer's decision about the application rate for each fertilizer, or the decision to forgo the application of a fertilizer, particularly potash and Trio\u00ae, varies from year to year depending on a number of factors. These factors include crop prices, weather patterns, fertilizer and other crop input costs, and the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil following the previous harvest. Farmers are more likely to increase application rates of fertilizers when crop prices are relatively high, fertilizer and other crop input costs are relatively low, or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively low. Conversely, farmers are likely to reduce application of fertilizers when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high. This variability in application rates can impact the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products. In addition, farmers may buy and apply potash or Trio\u00ae in excess of current crop needs, which results in a build-up of potassium in the soil that can be used by crops in subsequent crop years. If this occurs, demand for our products could be delayed to future periods.\nState and federal governmental policies, including farm and ethanol subsidies and commodity support programs, may also influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted, and the use of fertilizers. In addition, there are various city, county, and state initiatives to regulate the use and application of fertilizers due to various environmental concerns. If U.S. agricultural production or fertilizer use decreased significantly due to one or more of these factors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe seasonal demand for our products, and the resulting variations in our cash flows from quarter to quarter, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and working capital requirements.\nThe fertilizer business is seasonal. With respect to domestic sales, we typically experience increased sales during the North American spring and fall application seasons. The degree of seasonality can change significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. We and our customers generally build inventories during low-demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during high-demand periods, resulting in increased working capital requirements just before the start of these seasons. If we are unable to accurately predict the timing of demand for our products due to variations in seasonality from year to year, our results of operations and working capital could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we do not have adequate storage capacity to manage varying inventory needs, we may need to reduce production or lower the price at which we sell product, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn mid-2016, we transitioned our East mine to Trio\u00ae-only, resulting in an increased supply of Trio\u00ae. Previously, Trio\u00ae was supply-constrained, which meant that we did not see as much seasonality with respect to purchases as we did for potash. As purchasers have gained increased confidence in our ability to supply this product closer to the traditional spring application season in the U.S., these purchasers have moved to more of a just-in-time purchasing model. As a result, we now experience more traditional seasonality with respect to our domestic Trio\u00ae sales.\nAs noted above, part of our strategy is to expand international sales of Trio\u00ae. We are currently marketing Trio\u00ae into many different parts of the world, all of which have different climates and fertilizer-application patterns. As a result, seasonality in our international Trio\u00ae sales may develop, which could cause volatility in our results of operations.\nOur Trio\u00ae profitability could be affected by market entrants or the introduction of langbeinite alternatives.\nLangbeinite is produced by us and one other company from a single resource located in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Additional competition in the market for langbeinite and comparable products exists and could increase in the future. Other companies could seek to create and market chemically similar alternatives to langbeinite. The market for langbeinite and our Trio\u00ae sales could be affected by the success of these and other products that are competitive with langbeinite, which could adversely affect the viability of our Trio\u00ae business and our results of operations and financial condition. Further, increases in the supply of langbeinite by us and the other producer may continue to pressure the sales price of Trio\u00ae.\nDue to the significant and sustained decline in potash prices over the past several years, we were required to write down the value of some of our long-lived assets. If potash or Trio\u00ae prices continue to decline, we could be required to record additional write-downs of our long-lived assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if an asset's total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $324 million related to our East and West conventional mining facilities, and our North facility in Carlsbad, New Mexico due to the continued decline in potash prices noted during this period.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise. These future events could include further significant and sustained declines in potash or Trio\u00ae prices or higher production and operating costs. Further, based on our analysis of the profitability of any of our facilities, we may decide to terminate or suspend operations at additional facilities. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are required to write down the value of our inventories, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market. In periods when the market prices for our products fall below our cost to produce them and the lower prices are not expected to be temporary, we are required to write down the value of our inventories. Any write-down of our inventory would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments totaling $20.4 million.\nThe execution of strategic projects could require more time and money than we expect, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we invest in strategic projects. The completion of these projects could require significantly more time and money than we expect. In some cases, the construction or commissioning processes could force us to slow or shut down normal operations at the affected facility for a period of time, which would cause lower production volume and higher production costs per ton. In addition, our management team and other employees may be required to spend a significant amount of time addressing strategic projects, which could mean that our normal operations receive less time and attention.\nWe are considering potential long-term opportunities for revenue and strategic growth, including additional solution mining related to our HB mine. These potential projects are at an early stage, and we may not proceed with any of them. Even if we proceed with one or more of these or other strategic projects, we may not realize the expected benefits despite substantial investments, they may cost significantly more than we expect, or we may encounter additional risks that we did not initially expect.\nMining is a complex process that frequently experiences production disruptions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe process of mining is complex. Production delays can occur due to equipment failures, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, environmental hazards, acts of nature, and other unexpected events or problems. Furthermore, production is dependent upon the maintenance and geotechnical structural integrity of our tailings and storage ponds. The amounts that we are required to spend on maintenance and repairs may be significant.\nOur East mine, surface and support facilities are greater than 50 years old; mining operations continually move further away from the shafts and despite modernization through sustaining capital, fixed assets may require increased repair or refurbishment. These conditions increase the exposure to higher operating costs or the increased probability of incidents.\nMining is a hazardous process, and accidents could result in significant costs or production delays.\nThe process of mining is hazardous and involves various risks and hazards that can result in serious accidents. If accidents or unforeseen events occur, or if our safety procedures are not effective, we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death, our operations could be interrupted, or we could be required to shut down or abandon affected facilities. Accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities.\nExisting or expanded oil and gas development near our mines could result in methane gas leaking from an oil and gas well into our mines. We test our mines regularly for methane gas. However, unlike coal mines, our mines are not constructed or equipped to deal with methane gas. Any intrusion of methane gas into our mines could cause a fire or an explosion resulting in loss of life or significant property damage or could require the suspension of all mining operations until the completion of\nextensive modifications and re-equipping of the mine. The costs of modifying our mines and equipment could make it uneconomical to reopen our mines. You can find more information about the co-development of potash and oil and gas resources near our New Mexico facilities under the risk factor below entitled \"Existing and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\"\nThe grade of ore that we mine could vary from our projections due to the complex geology and mineralogy of potash reserves, which could adversely affect our potash production and our results of operations.\nPotash ore bodies have complex geology. Our potash production is affected by the potassium content and other mineralogy of the ore. Our projections of ore grade may not be accurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore grade, including many factors beyond our control. As the grade of our remaining ore reserves decreases over time, we need to process more ore to produce the same amount of saleable-grade product, increasing our costs and slowing our production. In addition, there are few opportunities to acquire more reserves in the areas around our current operations. If we are unable to process more ore to maintain current production levels, if the processing of more ore materially increases our costs, or if our ore grade projections are not accurate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause us to negatively adjust our previous assumptions, the quantities and value of our reserves, and in turn our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating our potash and langbeinite reserves. As a result, our reserve estimates necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including the following:\n\u2022\ngeologic and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine or operate\n\u2022\nfuture potash prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, royalties, severance and excise taxes, and development and reclamation costs\n\u2022\nfuture mining technology improvements\n\u2022\nthe effects of governmental regulation\n\u2022\nvariations in mineralogy\nIn addition, because reserves are only estimates built on various assumptions, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness. It is only after extraction that reserve estimates can be compared to actual values to adjust estimates of the remaining reserves. If any of the assumptions that we make in connection with our reserve estimates are incorrect, the amounts of potash and langbeinite that we are able to economically recover from our mines could be significantly lower than our reserve estimates. In addition, we periodically review the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates. If future events cause us to negatively adjust our previous assumptions, our reserve estimates could be adversely affected. In any of these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could lead to lower domestic potash prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in these currencies could cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe U.S. imports the majority of its potash, including from Canada, Russia and Belarus. If the local currencies for foreign suppliers strengthen in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal U.S. dollar prices. Strengthening of these local currencies therefore tends to support higher U.S. potash prices as the foreign suppliers attempt to maintain their margins. However, if these local currencies continue to weaken in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign suppliers may continue to lower prices to increase sales volume while again maintaining a margin in their local currency. We are currently in a period where the U.S. dollar is strong in comparison to many foreign currencies, which has led to increased imports into the U.S. These activities could cause our sales prices and results of operations to decrease or fluctuate significantly.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions in the financial markets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic volatility and uncertainty can create uncertainty for farmers and customers in the geographic areas where we sell our products. If farmers reduce, delay, or forgo their potash and Trio\u00ae purchases due to this uncertainty, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could limit our customers' ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products, which would decrease our sales volume. Changes in governmental banking, monetary, and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. It is difficult to determine the extent of economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they could negatively affect our customers and business. In addition, if we are required to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit during an economic downturn, we could be unable to do so on favorable terms or at all.\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, or changes in enforcement practices, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our operations, objectives, or reporting practices in ways that adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of or enforcement practices with respect to existing laws and regulations, could similarly impact our business.\nFor example, we are subject to significant regulation under MSHA and OSHA. High-profile mining accidents could prompt governmental authorities to enact new laws and regulations that apply to our operations or to more strictly enforce existing laws and regulations.\nPhysical effects of climate change, and climate change legislation, could have a negative effect on our operations and results of operations.\nThe potential physical effects of climate change could have an adverse effect on us and our customers. These effects could include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels, water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These changes could have an adverse effect on our costs, production, or sales, especially with respect to our solar operations. These changes could also have an adverse effect on our customers, which in turn could reduce the demand or price for our products.\nIn addition, federal and state legislators and regulators regularly consider ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate climate change. Any new rules could have a significant impact on our operations and products and could result in substantial additional costs for us.\nOur business depends on skilled and experienced workers, and our inability to find and retain quality workers could have an adverse effect on our development and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled managers, engineers, and other workers. At times, we may not be able to find or retain qualified workers. In particular, the labor market around Carlsbad, New Mexico, is competitive and employee turnover is generally high. In that market, we compete for experienced workers with several other employers, including natural resource and hazardous waste facilities, oil fields, and another producer of langbeinite. If we are not able to attract and retain quality workers, the development of our business could suffer or we could be required to raise wages to keep our employees, hire less qualified workers, or incur higher training costs. These risks may be exacerbated in times when we need to reduce our workforce due to economic conditions, such as in 2016. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In mid-2016, we idled our West mine and transitioned it into care-and-maintenance mode and transitioned our East mine to Trio\u00ae-only, resulting in our laying off a significant number of skilled employees in New Mexico. This may make it more difficult for us to re-hire skilled employees in the future.\nChanges in the prices of energy and other important materials used in our business, or disruptions to their supply, could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, or financial condition.\nNatural gas, electricity, steel, water, chemicals, diesel, and gasoline are key materials that we purchase and use in the production of our products. The prices of these commodities are volatile.\nOur sales and profitability are impacted by the price and availability of these materials. A significant increase in the price of these materials that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products, or an extended interruption in the supply of these materials to our production facilities, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, high natural gas or other fuel costs could increase crop input costs for farmers, which could cause our sales to decline.\nA decline in oil and gas drilling or a reduction in the use of potash in drilling fluids could increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue.\nA portion of our revenue comes from the sale of potassium chloride for use in oil and gas drilling fluids. Oil and gas drilling decreased significantly over the past couple of years, although it is showing signs of stabilizing. A continued decline in oil and gas drilling could reduce our sales into this industrial market. In addition, alternative products that have some of the same clay-inhibiting properties as potash are commercially available. These alternative products could temporarily or permanently replace some of our sales into the industrial market, where our average net realized sales price per ton is higher than it is for the agricultural market. If a significant amount of our sales shift from the industrial market to the agricultural market due to any of these factors, our revenue could decline and shipping costs could increase to reach these markets.\nIncreased costs could affect our per-ton profitability.\nA substantial portion of our operating costs is comprised of fixed costs that do not vary based on production levels. These fixed costs include labor and benefits, base energy usage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance expenditures, and depreciation. Any increase in fixed costs or decrease in production generally increases our per-ton costs and correspondingly decreases our per-ton operating margin. As a result, a significant increase in costs at any of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows, particularly during periods of lower potash prices.\nA shortage of railcars or trucks for transporting our products, increased transit times, or interruptions in railcar or truck transportation could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales, higher transportation or equipment costs, or disruptions in production.\nWe rely heavily upon truck and rail transportation to deliver our products to our customers. In addition, the cost of transportation is an important component of the price of our products. A shortage of trucks or railcars for carrying product or increased transit times due to accidents, highway or railway disruptions, congestion, high or compressed demand, labor disputes, adverse weather, natural disasters, changes to transportation systems, or other events could prevent us from making timely delivery to our customers or lead to higher transportation costs. As a result, we could experience customer dissatisfaction or a loss of sales. Similarly, disruption within the transportation systems could negatively affect our ability to obtain the supplies and equipment necessary to produce our products. We may also have difficulty obtaining access to ships to deliver our products to overseas customers.\nWe rely on our management personnel for the development and execution of our business strategy, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business.\nOur management personnel have significant relevant industry and company-specific experience. Our senior management team has developed and implemented first-of-their-kind processes and other innovative ideas that are important to our business. If we are unable to retain these individuals, our operations could be disrupted and we may be unable to achieve our business strategies and grow effectively. We do not currently maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our management personnel.\nExisting and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior regulates the development of federal mineral resources-both potash and oil and gas-on federal lands in the Designated Potash Area. This 497,000-acre region outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, includes all of our New Mexico operations and facilities. In 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an updated order that provides guidance to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") and industry on the co-development of these resources.\nIt is possible that oil and gas drilling in this area could limit our ability to mine valuable potash reserves or mineralized deposits because of setbacks from oil and gas wells and the establishment of unminable buffer areas around oil or gas wells. It is also possible that the BLM could determine that the size of these unminable buffer areas should be larger than they are currently, which could impact our ability to mine our potash reserves. We review applications for permits to drill oil and gas wells as they are publicly disclosed by the BLM and the State of New Mexico. When appropriate, we protest applications for drilling permits that we believe should not be drilled consistent with the operative federal and state rules and that could impair our ability to mine our potash reserves or put at risk the safety of our potash miners. We may not prevail in these protests or be able to prevent wells from being drilled in the vicinity of our potash reserves. If, notwithstanding our protests and appeals, a sufficient number of wells are drilled through or near our potash reserves, our potash reserves could be significantly impaired, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain the required permits, governmental approvals, and leases necessary for our operations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe hold numerous environmental, mining, safety, and other permits and governmental approvals authorizing the operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could prevent or limit us from continuing our operations at the affected facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we could be required to expend significant amounts to obtain these permits, approvals, and leases, or we could be required to make significant capital investments to modify or suspend our operations at one or more of our facilities.\nAny expansion of our existing operations would require us to secure the necessary environmental and other permits and approvals. We may not be able to obtain these permits and approvals in a timely manner or at all. In addition, the federal government must consider and study a project's likely environmental impacts. Based on the federal government's conclusion, it could require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement as a condition of approving a project or permit, which could result in significant time delays and costs. Furthermore, many of our operations take place on land that is leased from federal and state governmental authorities. Expansion of our existing operations could require securing additional federal and state leases. We may not be able to obtain or renew these leases on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our existing leases generally require us to commence mining operations within a specified time frame and to continue mining in order to retain the lease. The loss or non-renewal of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated reserves.\nAlso, our existing leases require us to make royalty payments based on the revenue generated by the potash we produce from the leased land. The royalty rates are subject to change whenever we renew our leases, which could lead to significant increases in these rates. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 17% of our state and federal lease acres at our New Mexico facilities (including leases at the HB and North mines) and 0.2% of our state and federal lease acres at our Utah operations will be up for renewal within the next five years. Increases in royalty rates would reduce our profit margins and, if the increases were significant, would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have less product diversification than nearly all of our competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dedicated exclusively to the production and marketing of potash and langbeinite, whereas nearly all of our competitors are diversified, primarily into nitrogen- or phosphate-based fertilizer businesses or other chemical or industrial businesses. Because we are focused exclusively on potash and langbeinite, and because we sell our products primarily within the U.S., we could be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business was more diversified and our sales more global. A decrease in the demand for potash and langbeinite would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, in periods when production exceeds demand, the price at which we sell our potash and langbeinite and our sales volumes would likely fall, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition more than our diversified competitors.\nHeavy precipitation or low evaporation rates at our solar solution mines could impact our potash production at those facilities, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nAll of our potash production comes from our solar solution mines. These facilities use solar evaporation ponds to form potash crystals from brines. Weather conditions at these facilities could negatively impact potash production. For example, heavy rainfall in September and October, just after the evaporation season ends, can reduce the amount of potash we produce in that year or the following year by causing the potash crystals to dissolve and consume pond capacity. Similarly, lower-than-average temperatures or higher-than-average seasonal rainfall would reduce evaporation rates and therefore impact production. If we experience heavy rainfall or low evaporation rates at any of our solar solution mines, we would have less potash available for sale, and our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInflows of water into our langbeinite mine from heavy rainfall or groundwater could result in increased costs and production downtime and could require us to abandon the mine, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMajor weather events such as heavy rainfall can result in water inflows into our underground, langbeinite mine. The presence of water-bearing strata in many underground mines carries the risk of water inflows into the mines. If we experience water inflows at our langbeinite mine, our employees could be injured and our equipment and mine shafts could be seriously damaged. We could be forced to shut down the mine temporarily, potentially resulting in significant production delays, and spend substantial funds to repair or replace damaged equipment. Inflows may also destabilize the mine shafts over time, resulting in safety hazards for employees and potentially leading to the permanent abandonment of the mine.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.\nWe are subject to many environmental, safety, and health laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to mine safety, mine land reclamation, remediation of hazardous substance releases, and discharges into the soil, air, and water.\nOur operations, as well as those of our predecessors, have involved the use and handling of regulated substances, hydrocarbons, potash, salt, related potash and salt by-products, and process tailings. These operations resulted, or may have resulted, in soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination. At some locations, salt-processing waste, building materials (including asbestos-containing material), and ordinary trash may have been disposed or buried in areas that have since been closed and covered with soil and other materials.\nWe could incur significant liabilities under environmental remediation laws such as CERCLA with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities, or off-site disposal locations. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, under some circumstances, liability may be imposed without regard to fault or legality of conduct and one party may be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site. Liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties.\nWe are also subject to federal and state environmental laws that regulate discharges of pollutants and contaminants into the environment, such as the U.S. Clean Water Act and the U.S. Clean Air Act. For example, our water disposal processes rely on dikes and reclamation ponds that could breach or leak, resulting in a possible prohibited release into the environment. Moreover, although the North and East mines in New Mexico and the Moab mine in Utah are designated as zero discharge facilities under the applicable water quality laws and regulations, these mines could experience some water discharges during significant rainfall events.\nWe expect that we will be required to continue to invest in environmental controls at our facilities and that these expenses could be significant. In addition, violations of environmental, safety, and health laws could subject us to civil and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. We could also be required to invest in additional equipment, facilities, or employees, or could incur significant liabilities, due to any of the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the interpretation of environmental laws\n\u2022\nmodifications to current environmental laws\n\u2022\nthe issuance of more stringent environmental laws\n\u2022\nmalfunctioning process or pollution control equipment\nMining and processing of potash also generates residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure. For example, potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt, iron, and clay, are stored in surface disposal sites and require management. At least one of our New Mexico facilities, the HB mine, may have issues regarding lead in the tailings pile as a result of operations conducted by previous owners. During the life of the tailings management areas, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to manage potash residual materials in accordance with environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements.\nAs a potash producer, we currently are exempt from certain State of New Mexico mining laws related to reclamation obligations. If this exemption were to be eliminated or restricted, we could be required to incur significant expenses related to reclamation at our New Mexico facilities.\nFor more information about environmental, safety and health matters affecting our business, see \"Business-Environmental, Safety, and Health Matters.\"\nAnti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur costs.\nAs a result of our international sales, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors even though these persons are not always subject to our control. Although we have implemented policies and training designed to promote compliance with these laws, these persons may take actions in violation of our policies. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nThe mining business is capital intensive, and our inability to fund necessary or desirable capital expenditures could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nThe mining business is capital intensive. We may find it necessary or desirable to make significant capital expenditures in the future to sustain or expand our existing operations and may not have, or have access to, the financial resources to pursue such expenditures. If costs associated with capital expenditures increase or if our earnings decrease significantly or we do not have access to the capital markets, we could have difficulty funding any necessary or desirable capital expenditures at an acceptable rate or at all. This could limit the expansion of our production or make it difficult for us to sustain our existing operations at optimal levels. Increased costs for capital expenditures could also have an adverse effect on the profitability of our existing operations and returns from our most recent strategic projects.\nMarket upheavals due to global pandemics, military actions, terrorist attacks, or economic repercussions from those events could reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nGlobal pandemics, actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or military or trade disruptions affecting the areas where we or our competitors do business could disrupt the global market for potassium-based products. As a result, our competitors may increase their sales efforts in our geographic markets and pricing of our products could suffer. If this occurs, we could lose sales to our competitors or be forced to lower our prices. In addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, local, state, and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the production, transportation, sale, or use of potassium-based products. These new regulations could result in lower sales or higher costs.\nA significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a variety of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support our operations. The proper functioning of these systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades as of a result of technological changes or growth in our business. These changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Our systems, and those of third-party providers, also could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, and cyber-attacks. Although we take steps to secure our systems and electronic information, these security measures may not be adequate. Any significant disruption to our systems could adversely affect our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by union activities.\nHourly employees at our Wendover facility are represented by a labor union. These employees represent approximately 7% of our workforce. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the union expires on May 31, 2017. Although we believe that our relations with our unionized employees are good, we may not be successful in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement as a result of general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, political, and other factors beyond our control. Any new agreement could result in a significant increase in our labor costs. In addition, a breakdown in negotiations or failure to timely enter into a new collective bargaining agreement could materially disrupt our Wendover operations.\nFrom time to time, efforts have been made to unionize employees at our other facilities. Additional unionization efforts could disrupt our business, consume management attention, or increase our operating costs. In addition, if these efforts were successful, we could experience increased labor costs, an increased risk of work stoppages, and limits on our flexibility to run our business in the most efficient manner to remain competitive.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSecurities markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and other factors outside our control. This market volatility could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly and without regard to our operating performance. Other factors that could affect the price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nfactors relating to our evaluation and assessment of potential strategic alternatives\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of our competitors\n\u2022\nthe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements or filings with the SEC\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry\n\u2022\nvariations in general economic, market, and political conditions\n\u2022\nchanges in certain commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates\n\u2022\nactions of our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers\n\u2022\nthe arrival or departure of key personnel\n\u2022\nother developments affecting us, our industry, or our competitors\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in this report\nIf our stock price declines due to one or more of these factors, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nOur stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"). For continued listing, we are required to meet specified listing standards, including a minimum stock price, market capitalization, and stockholders' equity. If we are unable to meet the NYSE's listing standards, including our common stock continuing to trade at over $1.00 per share, the NYSE would delist our common stock. At that point, it is possible that our common stock could be quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or the pink sheets. This could have negative consequences, including reduced liquidity for stockholders; reduced trading levels for our common stock; limited availability of market quotations or analyst coverage of our common stock; stricter trading rules for brokers trading our common stock; and reduced access to financing alternatives for us. We also would be subject to greater state securities regulation if our common stock was no longer listed on a national securities exchange.\nWe may issue additional securities, including securities that are senior in right of dividends, liquidation, and voting to our common stock, without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.\nOur board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock without the approval of our stockholders, except as may be required by applicable NYSE rules. Our board of directors may approve the issuance of preferred stock with terms that are senior to our common stock in right of dividends, liquidation or voting. Our issuance of additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour pre-existing stockholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished\n\u2022\nthe market price of the common stock may decline\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, could depress our common stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or our directors and officers, including related to our exploration of strategic alternatives, or the perception that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock would have on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions provide for the following:\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock without prior stockholder approval, except as may be required by applicable NYSE rules\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from acting by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders\n\u2022\nrequire vacancies and newly created directorships on the board of directors to be filled only by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then serving on the board\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting\n\u2022\nclassify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year\nThese provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of the common stock they own.", "PERMNO": 92621, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "IPI"}
