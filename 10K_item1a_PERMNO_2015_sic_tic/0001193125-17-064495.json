{"cik": "91767", "company": "SONOCO PRODUCTS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of our securities. These factors could also cause our actual results to materially differ from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements we make in this report, in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in our public announcements. You should consider the risk factors described below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in evaluating us, our business, and any investment in our securities. Although these are the most significant risk factors of which we are currently aware, they are not the only risk factors to which we are subject. Additional risk factors not currently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could also adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nChallenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.\nAlthough our business is diversified across various markets and customers, because of the nature of our products and services, general economic downturns in the United States and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The current global economic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment, shrinking middle class incomes and slowing consumption, the difficulties of the United States and other countries in dealing with their rising debt levels, and currency fluctuations are likely to continue to put pressure on the economy, and on us. As we have experienced over the past several years, tightening of credit availability and/or financial difficulties, leading to declines in consumer and business confidence and spending, affect us, our customers, suppliers and distributors. When such conditions exist, customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether. Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to market, which may affect our ability to meet customer demands, and result in loss of business. Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product price/mix and lower profit margins. All of these factors may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe have operations throughout North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia, with 318 facilities in 33 countries. In 2016, approximately 35% of consolidated sales came from operations and sales outside of the United States, and we expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future. Management of global operations is extremely complex, and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks that may not exist, or be as significant, in the United States. These additional risks may adversely affect our business operations and financial results, and include, without limitation:\n\u2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency exchange controls;\n\u2022 hyperinflation and currency devaluation;\n\u2022 possible limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022 non-tariff barriers, duties, taxes or government royalties, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;\n\u2022 changes in tax laws, or the interpretation of such laws, affecting foreign tax credits or tax deductions relating to our non U.S. earnings or operations, and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held by non-U.S. subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022 inconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 high social benefit costs for labor, including more expansive rights of foreign unions and work councils, and costs associated with restructuring activities;\n\u2022 national and regional labor strikes;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022 geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world;\n\u2022 foreign governments\u2019 restrictive trade policies, and customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022 compliance with and changes in applicable foreign laws;\n\u2022 compliance with U.S. laws, including those affecting trade and foreign investment and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022 loss or non-renewal of treaties between foreign governments and the U.S.;\n\u2022 product boycotts, including with respect to products of our multi-national customers;\n\u2022 increased costs of maintaining international manufacturing facilities and undertaking international marketing programs;\n\u2022 difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 the potential for nationalization or expropriation of our enterprises or facilities without appropriate compensation; and\n\u2022 political, social, legal and economic instability, civil unrest, war, catastrophic events, acts of terrorism, and widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases.\nGlobal economic conditions, disruptions in the credit markets and instability of the Euro could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, there has been concern regarding the overall long-term stability of the Euro and the future of the Euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. Potential negative developments (such as a Eurozone country in which we operate replacing the Euro with its own currency) and market perceptions related to the Euro could adversely affect the value of our Euro-denominated assets, reduce the amount of our translated amounts of U.S. dollar revenue and income from operations, and otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although instability of the Euro would likely have more broad-reaching effects than only to euro-denominated economies, annual revenue in 2016 for our businesses where the Euro is the functional currency totaled $515 million.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit), which could cause disruptions to and\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\nFORM 10-K\ncreate uncertainty surrounding our U.K. businesses, including affecting relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Although the Brexit decision could have broad-reaching effects beyond just in the U.K. itself, annual revenue in 2016 for our U.K. businesses alone totaled $94 million.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nFurthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.\nRaw materials, energy and other price increases or shortages may reduce our net income.\nAs a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials, labor and other inputs. Most of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties. Principal examples are recovered paper, steel, aluminum and resin. Prices and availability of these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, currency and commodity price fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our performance depends, in part, on our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers by raising selling prices and/or offset the impact by improving productivity. Although many of our long-term contracts and non-contractual pricing arrangements with customers permit limited price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs, such adjustments may not occur quickly enough, or be sufficient to prevent a materially adverse effect on net income and cash flow. Furthermore, we may not be able to improve productivity or realize sufficient savings from our cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of increased costs.\nSome of our manufacturing operations require the use of substantial amounts of electricity and natural gas, which may be subject to significant price increases as the result of changes in overall supply and demand and the impacts of legislation and regulatory action. We forecast and monitor energy usage, and, from time to time, use commodity futures or swaps in an attempt to reduce the impact of energy price increases. However, we cannot guarantee success in these efforts, and we could suffer adverse effects to net income and cash flow should we be unable to either offset or pass higher energy costs through to our customers in a timely manner or at all.\nSupply shortages or disruptions in our supply chains could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment and supplies from our suppliers, and, in turn, adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, which could limit our potential for growth.\nWe have made numerous acquisitions in recent years, and may actively seek new acquisitions that management believes will provide meaningful opportunities for growth. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions. Other companies in our industries have similar investment and acquisition strategies to ours, and competition for acquisitions may intensify. If we are unable to identify acquisition candidates that meet our criteria, our potential for growth may be restricted.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAcquired businesses may not achieve the expected levels of revenue, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, and acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses, and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions also involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, and the challenges of effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nOther risks and challenges associated with acquisitions include, without limitation:\n\u2022 demands on management related to increase in size of our businesses and additional responsibilities of management;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022 disruptions to our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022 inaccurate estimates of fair value in accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022 difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022 difficulties in integration of departments, systems, technologies, books and records, controls (including internal financial and disclosure controls), procedures, and policies;\nFORM 10-K\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\n\u2022 potential loss of major customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022 challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions.\nWhile management believes that acquisitions will improve our competitiveness and profitability, no assurance can be given that acquisitions will be successful or accretive to earnings. If actual performance in an acquisition falls significantly short of the projected results, or the assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances was inaccurate or changes, it is possible that a noncash impairment charge of any related goodwill would be required.\nWe may encounter difficulties restructuring operations or closing or disposing of facilities.\nWe are continuously seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve our customers and to respond to changes in our markets. Accordingly, from time to time, we have, and are likely to again, close higher-cost facilities, sell non-core assets and otherwise restructure operations in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. As a result, restructuring and divestiture costs have been, and are expected to be, a recurring component of our operating costs, and may vary significantly from year to year depending on the scope of such activities. Divestitures and restructuring may also result in significant financial charges for the write-off or impairment of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, such activities may divert the attention of management, disrupt our ordinary operations, or result in a reduction in the volume of products produced and sold. There is no guarantee that any such activities will achieve our goals, and if we cannot successfully manage the associated risks, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition, and failure to compete effectively can have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets. We regularly bid for new and continuing business, and being a responsive, high-quality, low-cost producer is a key component of effective competition. The loss of business from our larger customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, or renewal of business with less favorable terms can have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its production requirements, could have a significant adverse impact on our sales and profitability.\nEach of our segments has large customers, and the loss of any of these could have a significant adverse effect on the segment\u2019s sales and, depending on the magnitude of the loss, our results of operations and financial condition. Although a majority of our master customer contracts are long-term, they are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, pricing, or volume requirements, and the contracts themselves often do not require a specific level of purchasing. There is no assurance that existing customer relationships will be renewed at the same level of production, or at all, at the end of the contract term. Furthermore, although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014, the loss of any of our major customers, a reduction in their purchasing levels or an adverse change in the terms of supply agreements with these customers could reduce our net sales and net income. Continued consolidation of our customers could exacerbate any such loss. For more information on concentration of sales volume in our reportable segments, see Item1(c), \u201cDependence on Customers.\u201d\nWe are subject to costs and liabilities related to environmental, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility laws and regulations that could adversely affect operating results.\nWe must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries in which we do business regarding the environment, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility. Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditures of financial and employee resources.\nFederal, state, provincial, foreign and local environmental requirements, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and particularly those relating to air, soil and water quality, handling, discharge, storage and disposal of a variety of substances, and climate change are significant factors in our business and generally increase our costs of operations. We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is, or was, contaminated by us or a third party at various sites that we now, or previously, owned, used or operated. Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties, as well as mandated remediation programs, that require substantial, and in some instances, unplanned capital expenditures.\nWe have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, fines, penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters, and costs relating to the damage of natural resources, lost property values and toxic tort claims. We have made expenditures to comply with environmental regulations and expect to make additional expenditures in the future. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $24.5 million was reserved for environmental liabilities. Such reserves are established when it is considered probable that we have some liability. However, because the extent of potential environmental damage, and the extent of our liability for the damage, is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time, our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently reserved amount. Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position.\nMany of our products come into contact with the food and beverages packaged within, and therefore we are subject to risks and liabilities related to health and safety matters in connection with those products.\nDisclosure regulations relating to the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing, availability and cost of materials used in the manufacture of some of our products. We will also incur costs associated with supply chain due diligence, and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a result of such due diligence. Because our supply chain is complex, we may also face reputation risk with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable sufficiently to verify the origins of all such minerals used in our products.\nChanges to laws and regulations dealing with environmental, health and safety, and corporate social responsibility issues are made or proposed with some frequency, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance.\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\nFORM 10-K\nProduct liability claims and other legal proceedings could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe produce products and provide services related to other parties\u2019 products. While we have built extensive operational processes intended to ensure that the design and manufacture of our products meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers will not experience operational process failures that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental claims and associated litigation. We are also subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in our areas of operation around the globe. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims; however, in the future, we may not be able to maintain such insurance at acceptable premium cost levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and the industries in which we operate are at times being reviewed or investigated by regulators and other governmental authorities, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards may require significant expenditures of time and other resources. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in pension plan assets or liabilities may reduce operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe sponsor various defined benefit plans worldwide, and have an aggregate projected benefit obligation for these plans of approximately $1.8 billion. The difference between defined benefit plan obligations and assets (the funded status of the plans) significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs and the ongoing funding requirements of the plans. Among other factors, changes in discount rates and lower-than-expected actual investment returns could substantially increase our future plan funding requirements and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We have total assets of approximately $1.3 billion funding a portion of the projected benefit obligations of the plans, which consist primarily of common collective trusts, mutual funds, common stocks and debt securities and also include alternative investments such as interests in real estate funds and hedge funds. If the performance of these assets does not meet our assumptions or discount rates decline, the underfunding of the plans may increase and we may have to contribute additional funds to these plans, and our pension expense may increase, which could adversely affect operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWe may not be able to develop new products acceptable to the market.\nFor many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely response to constantly changing consumer demands and preferences. Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers. Consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. Our failure, or the failure of our customers, to develop new or better products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential and affect our competitive position, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe, or our customers, may not be able to obtain necessary credit or, if so, on reasonable terms.\nWe have $1.0 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding. We also operate a $350 million commercial paper program, supported by a credit facility of an equal amount committed by a syndicate of eight banks until October 2019. If we were prevented from issuing commercial paper, we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on the underlying bank credit facility. We believe that the lenders have the ability to meet their obligations under the facility. However, if these obligations were not met, we may be forced to seek more costly or cumbersome forms of credit. Should such credit be unavailable for an extended time, it would significantly affect our ability to operate our business and execute our plans. In addition, our customers may experience liquidity problems as a result of a negative change in the economic environment, including the ability to obtain credit, that could limit their ability to purchase our products and services or satisfy their existing obligations.\nOur credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our cost of borrowing.\nCertain of our debt agreements impose restrictions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios and the disposition of assets. The most restrictive covenant currently requires us to maintain a minimum level of interest coverage, and a minimum level of net worth. Although we were substantially above these minimum levels at December 31, 2016, these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to engage in certain business activities that would otherwise be in our best long-term interests.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow, increase our vulnerability to economic conditions, and limit or restrict our business activities.\nIn addition to interest payments, from time to time a significant portion of our cash flow may need to be used to service our indebtedness, and, therefore, may not be available for use in our business. Our ability to generate cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our indebtedness could have a significant impact on us, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the\nFORM 10-K\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\namount of our cash flow available to fund working capital, acquisitions and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.\nDespite our current levels of indebtedness, we may incur additional debt in the future, which could increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe are continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities and may incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions and to fund any resulting increased operating needs. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could increase. While we will have to effect any new financing in compliance with the agreements governing our then existing indebtedness, changes in our debt levels and or debt structure may impact our credit rating and costs to borrow, as well as constrain our future financial flexibility in the event of a deterioration in our financial operating performance or financial condition.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may reduce operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates can cause translation, transaction and other losses that can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, as a result of operating globally, a portion of our consolidated net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In our consolidated financial statements, we translate the local currency financial results of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars based on their respective exchange rates. Depending on the direction, changes in those rates will either increase or decrease operating results and balances as reported in U.S. dollars. Although we monitor our exposures and, from time to time, may use forward currency contracts to hedge certain forecasted currency transactions or foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency fluctuations and exposes us to counterparty risk of nonperformance.\nThere are also ongoing concerns about the stability of the euro and its continued viability as a single European currency. If individual countries were to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, euro-denominated assets could be significantly devalued. In addition, a dislocation or dissolution of the euro could cause significant volatility and disruption in the global economy, which could adversely impact our business, including the demand for our products, the availability and cost of supplies and materials and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs.\nAdverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.\nWe manufacture packaging products for beverages and foods as as well as products used in construction and industrial manufacturing. Unseasonably cool weather can temporarily reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. In addition, poor weather conditions can temporarily impact the level of construction and industrial activity and also impact the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. Such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology and its failure or disruption could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, vendor and other data, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions, and we rely on various technologies to process, store and report information about our business, and to interact with customers, vendors and employees around the world. As with all large systems, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruption or shutdown due to power outages, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber attacks, catastrophic events, telecommunications failures, user errors, unauthorized access, and malicious or accidental destruction of information or functionality. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, misplaced or lost data, and programming and/or user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information.\nInformation system damages, disruptions, shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions, transaction errors, loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or compensatory payments, and other costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, our systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a write down would negatively impact operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAt December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was approximately $1.3 billion. We are required to evaluate our goodwill amounts annually, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, changes in our business strategy, and external market conditions, among other factors, could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income. If a significant write down were required, the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented executives, managers and employees is critical to our success.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers, is important to our business. The experience and industry contacts of our management team and other key personnel significantly benefit us, and we need expertise like theirs to carry out our business strategies and plans. We also rely on the specialized knowledge and experience of cer-\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\nFORM 10-K\ntain key technical employees. The loss of these key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives, managers and employees, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success, and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key officers and employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nFull realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors.\nWe have deferred tax assets, including U.S. and foreign operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, employee and retiree benefit items, and other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes. We have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized prior to expiration of such deferred tax assets. Our ability to use these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our having future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences. We expect to realize these assets over an extended period. However, if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there were a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences became taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which would increase our effective tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.\nOur annual effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay can change materially as a result of changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, changes in the mix of our U.S. and foreign earnings, adjustments to our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issues, and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nAs a large multinational corporation, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and many foreign tax laws and regulations, all of which are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Changes in these laws or regulations, or any change in the position of taxing authorities regarding their application, administration or interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations.\nDue to widely varying tax rates in the taxing jurisdictions applicable to our business, a change in income generation to higher taxing jurisdictions or away from lower taxing jurisdictions may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make estimates of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues based on our assessment of relevant risks and facts and circumstances existing at the time, and we use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. These estimates are highly judgmental. Although we believe we adequately provide for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities, which may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate significantly.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are subject to regular examination by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These taxing authorities may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any tax authorities were successfully to challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations.\nFuture changes in tax law could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and our deferred tax asset and liability balances. Recent proposals to lower the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net federal deferred tax liability upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding one-time, non-cash decrease in income tax expense. In addition, these proposals would create a territorial system and would require a one-time current tax expense and cash payment associated with undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nContinuing consolidation of our customer base and suppliers may intensify pricing pressure.\nLike us, many of our larger customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines, and many of our customers have been acquired. Additionally, many of our suppliers of raw materials are consolidating. This consolidation of customers and suppliers has increased the concentration of our business with our largest customers, and in some cases, increased pricing pressures. Similarly, consolidation of our larger suppliers has resulted in increased pricing pressures from our suppliers. Further consolidation of customers and suppliers could intensify pricing pressure and reduce our net sales and operating results.\nChallenges to, or the loss of, our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. We own a large number of patents on our products, aspects of our products, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing, and we own, or have licenses to use, all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. Furthermore, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain of our competitive advantages, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we are from time to time subject to claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights. If we were held liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.\nIntellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management, may be neces-\nFORM 10-K\nSONOCO 2016 ANNUAL REPORT\nsary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to protect our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nMaterial disruptions in our business operations could negatively affect our financial results.\nAlthough we take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities, we may nonetheless from time to time encounter an unforeseen material operational disruption in one of our major facilities, which could negatively impact production and our financial results. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to a major equipment failure, labor stoppages, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials, disruptions at our suppliers, fire, severe weather conditions and disruptions in utility services. These types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our earnings to varying degrees depending upon the facility, the duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative sources of materials or energy. Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles.", "PERMNO": 71176, "SIC": 2650, "TIC": "SON"}
