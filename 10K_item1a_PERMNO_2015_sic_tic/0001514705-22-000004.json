{"cik": "1514705", "company": "SunCoke Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. These risk factors represent what we believe to be the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to these risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results.\nThese risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business and Industry\nThe financial performance of our cokemaking and logistics businesses is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any of these customers, or any failure by them to perform under their contracts with us, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, permit compliance, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of our coke sales currently are made pursuant to long-term contracts with Cliffs Steel and U.S. Steel. We expect these customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our major customers and other parties. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration of their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations. During periods of weak demand for steel or coal, our customers may experience significant reductions in their operations, or substantial declines in the prices of the steel, or coal products, they sell. These and other factors such as labor relations or bankruptcy filings may lead certain of our customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their existing contractual commitments to us, or reduce their utilization of our services. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe loss of any of these customers (or financial difficulties at any of these customers, which result in nonpayment or nonperformance) could have a significant adverse effect on our business. If one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce its purchases of coke or logistics services from us without a make-whole payment, or default on their agreements with us, or terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us, or if we were unable to sell such coke or logistics services to these customers on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our cash flows, financial position, permit compliance, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur cokemaking and logistics businesses are subject to operating risks, some of which are beyond our control. Equipment failures or deterioration of assets, may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns, impairments, or additional expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFactors beyond our control could disrupt our cokemaking and logistics operations, adversely affect our ability to service the needs of our customers and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. Adverse developments at our cokemaking facilities could significantly disrupt our ability to produce and supply coke, steam, and/or electricity to our customers. Adverse developments at our logistics operations could significantly disrupt our ability to provide handling, mixing, storage, terminalling, transloading and/or transportation services, of coal and other dry and liquid bulk commodities, to our customers. Our operations depend upon critical pieces of equipment that occasionally may be out of service for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures. Assets and equipment critical to these operations also may deteriorate or become depleted materially sooner than we currently estimate, resulting in additional maintenance spending or additional replacement capital expenditures.\nOur cokemaking and logistics operations are subject to significant hazards and risks, any of which could result in production and transportation difficulties and disruptions, equipment failures and risk of catastrophic loss, permit non-compliance, pollution, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others. Such hazards and risks include, but are not limited to\n\u2022geological, hydrologic, or other conditions that may cause damage to infrastructure or personnel;\n\u2022fire, explosion, or other major incident causing injury to personnel and/or equipment that causes a cessation, or significant curtailment, of all or part of our cokemaking or logistics operations at a site for a period of time;\n\u2022processing and plant equipment failures or malfunction, operating hazards and unexpected maintenance problems affecting our cokemaking or logistics operations, or our customers;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as severe winds, heavy rains or snow, flooding, extreme temperatures and other natural events, including those resulting from climate change, affecting our cokemaking or logistics operations, transportation, or our customers; and\n\u2022possible legal challenges to the renewal of key permits, which may lead to their renewal on terms that restrict our cokemaking or logistics operations, or impose additional costs on us.\nIf any of these conditions or events occur, our cokemaking or logistics operations may be disrupted, operating costs could increase significantly and we could incur substantial losses. Such disruptions in our operations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In particular, to the extent a disruption leads to our failure to maintain the temperature inside our coke oven batteries, we may not be able to maintain the integrity of the ovens or to continue operation of such coke ovens, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements for coke and, in some cases, electricity and/or steam.\nIf our assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, or we are not able to execute on capital maintenance or procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face competition, both in our cokemaking operations and in our logistics business, which has the potential to reduce demand for our products and services, and that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition, both in our cokemaking operations and in our logistics business:\n\u2022Cokemaking operations: Historically, coke has been used as a main input in the production of steel in blast furnaces. However, some blast furnace operators have relied upon natural gas, pulverized coal, and/or other coke substitutes. Many steelmakers also are exploring alternatives to blast furnace technology that require less or no use of coke or alternatives that reduce the amount of GHG emissions from the process. For example, electric arc furnace technology is a commercially proven process widely used in the United States. As these alternative processes for production of steel become more widespread, the demand for coke, including the coke we produce, may be significantly reduced. We also face competition from alternative cokemaking technologies, including both by-product and heat recovery technologies. As these technologies improve and as new technologies are developed, competition in the cokemaking industry may intensify. As alternative processes for production of steel become more widespread, the demand for coke, including the coke we produce, may be significantly reduced.\n\u2022Logistics business: Decreased throughput and utilization of our logistics assets could result indirectly due to competition in the electrical power generation business from abundant and relatively inexpensive supplies of natural gas displacing thermal coal as a fuel for electrical power generation by utility companies. In addition, competition in the steel industry from processes such as electric arc furnaces, or blast furnace injection of pulverized coal or natural gas, may reduce the demand for metallurgical coals processed through our logistics facilities. In the future, additional coal handling facilities and terminals with rail and/or barge access may be constructed in the Eastern United States. Such additional facilities could compete directly with us in specific markets now served by our logistics business. Certain coal mining companies and independent terminal operators in some areas may compete directly with our logistics facilities. In some markets, trucks may competitively deliver mined coal to certain shorter-haul destinations, resulting in reduced utilization of existing terminal capacity.\nSuch competition could reduce demand for our products and services, thus having a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which may increase our cost of doing business and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to: discharges of substances into the surrounding environment including the air, water and ground; emissions of GHGs; compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS); management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; cleanup of contaminated sites; protection of groundwater quality and availability; protection of plants and wildlife; reclamation and restoration of properties after completion of mining or drilling; sales of electric power; installation of safety equipment in our facilities; and protection of employee health and safety. Complying with these and other regulatory requirements, including the terms of our permits, can be costly and time-consuming, and may hinder operations. In addition, these requirements are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Regulatory requirements, including those related to GHGs, may change in the future in a manner that could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could cause delays in permitting or development of projects or materially limit, or increase the cost of, our operations. We may not have been, or may not be, at all times, in complete compliance with all such requirements, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such requirements, or in connection with remediation at sites we own, or third-party sites where it has been alleged that we have liability, in excess of the amounts we have accrued. For a description of certain environmental laws and matters applicable to us and associated risks, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Legal and Regulatory Requirements.\u201d\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations result in emissions of various substances to the air, including GHGs, use hazardous materials, and generate solid and hazardous waste. We have in the past and could in the future be subject to claims under federal, state and local laws and regulations arising from these activities, including for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, or groundwater. We previously have been and could again in the future be subject to litigation for alleged bodily injuries or property damage arising from claimed exposure to emissions or hazardous substances allegedly used, released, or disposed of by us, as well as litigation related to climate change by governments, private entities, or individuals. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within our control. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate, but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. Environmental impacts resulting from our operations, including exposures to emissions, hazardous substances, or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew permits or leases necessary for our operations, which could materially reduce our production, cash flows or profitability.\nOur cokemaking and logistics operations require us to obtain a number of permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters. These, as well as our facilities and operations (including our generation of electricity), require permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by our regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future cokemaking and/or logistics facilities. Non-governmental organizations, environmental groups and individuals have certain rights to engage in the permitting process, and may comment upon, or object to, the requested permits. Such persons also have the right to bring citizen\u2019s lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, or the validity of environmental impact statements related thereto. If any permits or leases are not issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or if permits issued or renewed are conditioned in a manner that restricts our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our operations, our cash flows or profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur businesses are subject to inherent risks, some for which we maintain third party insurance and some for which we self-insure. We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. We may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, certain risks, such as certain environmental and pollution risks, and certain cybersecurity risks, generally are not fully insurable. We must compensate employees for work-related injuries. If we do not make adequate provision for our workers' compensation liabilities, or we are pursued for applicable sanctions, costs, and liabilities, our operations and our profitability could be adversely affected. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from un-insured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies or plans, and we may experience significant risks associated with future acquisitions, investments and/or divestitures. If we are unable to execute our strategic plans, whether as a result of unfavorable market conditions in the industries in which our customers operate, or otherwise, our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA portion of our strategy to grow our business is dependent upon our ability to acquire and operate new assets that result in an increase in our earnings. We may not derive the financial returns we expect on our investment in such additional assets or such operations may not be profitable. We cannot predict the effect that any failed expansion may have on our core businesses. The success of our future acquisitions and/or investments will depend substantially on the accuracy of our analysis concerning such businesses and our ability to complete such acquisitions or investments on favorable terms, as well as to finance such acquisitions or investments and to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations. Risks associated with acquisitions include the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience. Antitrust and other laws may prevent us from completing acquisitions. If we are not able to execute our strategic plans effectively, or successfully integrate new operations, whether as a result of unfavorable market conditions in the industries in which our customers operate, or otherwise, our business reputation could suffer and future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the event we form joint ventures or other similar arrangements, we must pay close attention to the organizational formalities and time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. We may share ownership and management with other parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do. The benefits from a successful investment in an existing entity or joint venture will be shared among the co-owners, so we will not receive the exclusive benefits from a successful investment. Additionally, if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe regularly review strategic opportunities to further our business objectives, and may eliminate assets that do not meet our return-on-investment criteria. The anticipated benefits of divestitures and other strategic transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than we expected. Such transactions also could result in a number of financial consequences having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position, including reduced cash balances; higher fixed expenses; the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities (including indemnification obligations); restructuring charges; loss of customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors or employees; legal, accounting and advisory fees; and impairment charges.\nImpairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under generally accepted accounting principles, long-lived assets must be reviewed for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management\u2019s plans change with respect to those assets. If business conditions or other factors cause profitability and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges.\nEvents and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include: the impact of a downturn in the global economy, competition, advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, and\nother factors leading to a reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability, or a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock or market capitalization, lower future cash flows, slower industry growth rates and other changes in the industries in which we or our customers operate.\nOur operating results have been and may continue to be affected by fluctuations in our costs of production, and, if we cannot pass increases in our costs of production to our customers, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nOur operations require a reliable supply of equipment, replacement parts and metallurgical coal. If the cost to produce coke and provide logistics services, including cost of supplies, equipment, metallurgical coal or labor, experience significant price inflation and we cannot pass such increases in our costs of production to our customers, our profit margins may be reduced and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations, and such costs and liabilities could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, efficacy and safety of our products and services. If our operations do not meet applicable safety standards, or our products or services are found to be unsafe, our relationships with customers could suffer and we could lose business or become subject to liability or claims. In addition, our cokemaking and logistics operations have inherent safety risks that may give rise to events resulting in death, injury, or property loss to employees, customers, or unaffiliated third parties. Depending upon the nature and severity of such events, we could be exposed to significant financial loss, reputational damage, potential civil or criminal government or other regulatory enforcement actions, or private litigation, the settlement or outcome of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nNew or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and physical effects attributed to climate change may adversely affect our operations and impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers.\nThere is increasing regulatory attention concerning the issue of climate change and the impact of GHGs, particularly from fossil fuels, which are integral to our cokemaking and logistics businesses. Our business and operations, as well as the business and operations of our key suppliers and customers, may become subject to legislation or regulation intended to limit GHG emissions, the use of fossil fuels or the effects of climate change or may be impacted by the increasing drive towards a lower carbon economy in an effort to limit the impacts of climate change. It is not possible to foresee the details of such legislation or regulations or changes in the economy or their resulting effects on our business. Because our coking process is dependent on coal as a raw material and the coking process generates carbon dioxide, we are limited in our ability to reduce our GHG emissions and could be affected by future regulation of GHGs, although we are evaluating the feasibility of reducing our GHG emissions profile. Any new regulations, legislation or taxes that affect other industries that use coal or other fossil fuels processed through our terminals could reduce throughput and utilization of our logistics assets. Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers due to increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines to our company and could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our suppliers may face cost increases to comply with any new legislation or regulations leading to higher costs to us for goods or services.\nClimate change may cause changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events and flooding. An increase in severe weather events and flooding may adversely impact us, our operations, and our ability to procure raw materials and manufacture and transport our products and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs, temporarily impact our production capabilities or cause damage to our facilities. For example, our terminals are located near bodies of water and may be impacted by flooding or hurricanes, disrupting our or our customers' ability to move products. Our coke plants are also generally located near bodies of water and may be impacted by the effects of climate change. Additionally, extreme cold could prevent coal delivery and unloading at our coke plants, impeding operation, or create a more hazardous outdoor working environment for our employees. Severe weather may also adversely impact our suppliers and our customers and their ability to purchase and transport our products.\nInvestor interest in climate change, fossil fuels, and sustainability could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nClimate change and sustainability have increasingly become important topics to investors and the community at large. As such, there have been recent efforts aimed at the investment community to encourage the divestment of shares of companies associated with energy, coal and/or fossil fuels, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail business relations with coal and fossil fuel companies. If these efforts are successful, our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted. Members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices, including management of GHGs and climate change. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other possible pandemics and similar outbreaks may disrupt our operations and continue to disrupt our customers\u2019 and suppliers' operations, which could continue to adversely impact our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, in 2020, COVID-19 spread to other countries including the U.S. and became a global pandemic. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing, travel bans and quarantines, have had negative impacts on the U.S. and global economy. The pandemic and response to the pandemic continues to evolve, and any preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take in respect of the pandemic could result in periods of significant business disruption. While our facilities have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic due to our inclusion in the Critical Manufacturing Sector as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and results of operations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and suppliers. For example, in 2020, certain of our steelmaking and logistics customers were adversely impacted by the idling of manufacturing plants and closed international ports, respectively, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to assist certain of our steelmaking customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented volume relief measures by providing near-term coke supply relief for such customers in exchange for extending of certain contracts. In addition, the progression of and global response to COVID-19 increases the risk of delays in construction activities related to our capital projects. The extent of such delays and other effects of COVID-19 on our anticipated investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations is unknown, but could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results of operations, and our customers' and suppliers' results of operations, are out of our control and will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and actions taken to contain it or mitigate its effects, as well as the effectiveness of vaccine rollout plans, the public's perception of the safety of the vaccines and their willingness to take the vaccines. As a result, the ultimate financial impact to SunCoke of the COVID-19 global pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Cokemaking Business\nIf a substantial portion of our agreements to supply coke, electricity, and/or steam are modified or terminated, our cash flows, financial position, permit compliance or results of operations may be adversely affected if we are not able to replace such agreements, or if we are not able to enter into new agreements at the same level of profitability.\nWe make substantially all of our coke, electricity and steam sales under long-term agreements. If a substantial portion of these agreements are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised, our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are not able to replace such agreements, or if we are not able to enter into new agreements at the same level of profitability. The profitability of our long-term coke, energy and steam sales agreements depends on a variety of factors that vary from agreement to agreement and fluctuate during the agreement term. We may not be able to obtain long-term agreements at favorable prices, compared either to market conditions or to our cost structure. Price changes provided in long-term supply agreements may not reflect actual increases in production costs. As a result, such cost increases may reduce profit margins on our long-term coke and energy sales agreements. In addition, contractual provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short-term price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we discuss the extension of existing agreements and enter into new long-term agreements for the supply of coke, steam, and energy to our customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coke, steam, or electricity from us under long-term agreements. In addition, declarations of bankruptcy by customers can result in changes in our contracts with less favorable terms. If any one or more of these customers were to become financially distressed and unable to pay us, significantly reduce their purchases of coke, steam, or electricity from us, or if we were unable to sell coke or electricity to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our\ncurrent agreements, our cash flows, financial position, permit compliance or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, because of certain technological design constraints, we do not have the ability to shut down our cokemaking operations if we do not have adequate customer demand. If a customer refuses to take or pay for our coke, we must continue to operate our coke ovens even though we may not be able to sell our coke immediately and may incur significant additional costs for natural gas to maintain the temperature inside our coke oven batteries and fees under our rail contracts to account for reductions in inbound coal or outbound coke shipments at our plants, which may have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nExcess capacity in the global steel industry, and/or increased exports of coke from producing countries, may weaken our customers' demand for our coke and could materially and adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nIn some countries steelmaking capacity exceeds demand for steel products. Rather than reducing employment by matching production capacity to consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) may export steel at prices that are significantly below their home market prices and that may not reflect their costs of production or capital. Our steelmaking customers may decrease the prices they charge for steel, or take other action, as the supply of steel increases. The profitability and financial position of our steelmaking customers may be adversely affected, causing such customers to reduce their demand for our coke and making it more likely that they may seek to renegotiate their contracts with us or fail to pay for the coke they are required to take under our contracts. In addition, future increases in exports of coke from China and/or other coke-producing countries also may reduce our customers' demand for coke capacity. Such reduced demand for our coke could adversely affect the certainty of our long-term relationships with our customers depress coke prices, and limit our ability to enter into new, or renew existing, commercial arrangements with our customers, as well as our ability to sell excess capacity in the spot market, and could materially and adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nCertain provisions in our long-term coke agreements may result in economic penalties to us, or may result in termination of our coke sales agreements for failure to meet minimum volume requirements, coal-to-coke yields or other required specifications, and certain provisions in these agreements and our energy sales agreements may permit our customers to suspend performance.\nOur agreements for the supply of coke, energy and/or steam, contain provisions requiring us to supply minimum volumes of our products to our customers. To the extent we do not meet these minimum volumes, we are generally required under the terms of our coke sales agreements to procure replacement supply to our customers at the applicable contract price or potentially be subject to cover damages for any shortfall. If future shortfalls occur, we will work with our customer to identify possible other supply sources while we implement operating improvements at the facility, but we may not be successful in identifying alternative supplies and may be subject to paying the contract price for any shortfall or to cover damages, either of which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability. Our coke sales agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coke that meets certain quality thresholds. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of our agreements. To the extent that we do not meet the coal-to-coke yield standard in an agreement, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process.\nOur coke and energy sales agreements contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by our customers for the duration of specified events beyond the control of our customers. Declaration of force majeure, coupled with a lengthy suspension of performance under one or more coke or energy sales agreements, may seriously and adversely affect our cash flows, financial position and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our cokemaking facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe quality of our coke is critical to the success of our business. For instance, our coke sales agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coke that meets certain quality thresholds. If our coke fails to meet such specifications, we could be subject to significant contractual damages or contract terminations, and our sales could be negatively affected. The quality of our coke depends significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program, our laboratories and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDisruptions to our supply of coal and coal mixing services may reduce the amount of coke we produce and deliver, and if we are not able to cover the shortfall in coal supply or obtain replacement mixing services from other providers, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.\nSubstantially all of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our cokemaking facilities is purchased from third-parties under one-year contracts, except for the Jewell facility, which purchases a substantial portion of its metallurgical coal under a five-year contract with prices reset annually. We cannot assure that there will continue to be an ample supply of metallurgical coal available or that these facilities will be supplied without any significant disruption in coke production, as economic, environmental, and other conditions outside of our control may reduce our ability to source sufficient amounts of coal for our forecasted operational needs. If we are not able to make up the shortfalls resulting from such supply failures through purchases of coal from other sources, the failure of our coal suppliers to meet their supply commitments could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and, ultimately, impact the structural integrity of our coke oven batteries.\nAt our Granite City and Haverhill cokemaking facilities, we rely on third-parties to mix coals that we have purchased into coal mixes that we use to produce coke. We have entered into long-term agreements with coal mixing service providers that are coterminous with our coke sales agreements. However, there are limited alternative providers of coal mixing services and any disruptions from our current service providers could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if our rail transportation agreements are terminated, we may have to pay higher rates to access rail lines or make alternative transportation arrangements.\nLimitations on the availability and reliability of transportation, and increases in transportation costs, particularly rail systems, could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain a supply of coal and deliver coke to our customers.\nOur ability to obtain coal depends primarily on third-party rail systems and to a lesser extent river barges. If we are unable to obtain rail or other transportation services, or are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Alternative transportation and delivery systems are generally inadequate and not suitable to handle the quantity of our shipments or to ensure timely delivery. The loss of access to rail capacity could create temporary disruption until the access is restored, significantly impairing our ability to receive coal and resulting in materially decreased revenues. Our ability to open new cokemaking facilities may also be affected by the availability and cost of rail or other transportation systems available for servicing these facilities.\nOur coke production obligations at our Jewell cokemaking facility and one half of our Haverhill cokemaking facility require us to deliver coke to certain customers via railcar. We have entered into long-term rail transportation agreements to meet these obligations. Disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems, including those related to climate change, mechanical difficulties, train derailments, infrastructure damage, strikes, lock-outs, lack of fuel or maintenance items, fuel costs, transportation delays, accidents, terrorism, domestic catastrophe or other events could temporarily, or over the long-term, impair our ability to produce coke, and therefore, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property, third parties may use our technology, which would impair our ability to compete in our markets.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our technologies and products throughout the world. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. We rely on patents to protect a significant part our intellectual property portfolio and to enhance our competitive position. However, our presently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents, and any patent previously issued to us or our subsidiaries may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Furthermore, the claims in patents that have been issued to us or our subsidiaries or that may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from using cokemaking technologies and heat recovery processes similar to ours. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries in which we plan to compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology, our ability to be commercially competitive may be materially impaired.\nWe are subject to certain political or country risks due to the Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil cokemaking facility that could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility is owned by ArcelorMittal Brazil. We earn income from the Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil operations through licensing and operating fees earned at the Brazilian cokemaking facility payable to us under long-term agreements with ArcelorMittal Brazil. These revenues depend on continuing operations and, in some cases, certain minimum production levels being achieved at the Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility. In the past, the Brazilian economy has been\ncharacterized by frequent and occasionally extensive intervention by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has changed in the past, and may change monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence Brazil\u2019s economy in the future. If the operations at the Vit\u00f3ria cokemaking facility are interrupted or if certain minimum production levels are not achieved, we will not be able to earn the same licensing and operating fees as we are currently earning, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, the Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-fraud. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits issuers and their strategic or local partners, agents or representatives, which we refer to as our intermediaries (even if those intermediaries are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws), from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit.\nWe take precautions to comply with these laws. However, these precautions may not protect us against liability, particularly as a result of actions by our intermediaries through whom we have exposure under these anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-fraud laws even though we may have limited or no ability to control such intermediaries. Any violations of such laws could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive and damaging to our reputation and could negatively impact our stock price. Failure by us or our intermediaries to comply with the foregoing or other anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-fraud laws could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, damage our reputation and negatively impact our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Logistics Business\nThe growth and success of our logistics business depends upon our ability to find and contract for adequate throughput volumes, and an extended decline in demand for coal could affect the customers for our logistics business adversely. As a consequence, the operating results and cash flows of our logistics business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe financial results of our logistics business segment are significantly affected by the demand for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal. An extended decline in our customers\u2019 demand for either thermal or metallurgical coals, including as a result of legislation or regulations promoting renewable energy or limiting carbon emissions from the energy sector, could result in a reduced need for the coal mixing, terminalling and transloading services we offer, thus reducing throughput and utilization of our logistics assets. Demand for such coals may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control:\n\u2022Thermal coal demand: may be impacted by changes in the energy consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users, as well as weather conditions and extreme temperatures. The amount of thermal coal consumed for electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, the availability, quality and price of competing fuels for power generation, and governmental regulation. For example, over the past few years, production of natural gas in the U.S. has increased dramatically, which has generally resulted in lower natural-gas prices. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, some coal-fuel generation plants have been displaced by natural-gas fueled generation plants. In addition, state and federal mandates and market demand for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources, or mandates for the retrofitting of existing coal-fired generators with pollution control systems, also could adversely impact the demand for thermal coal. Finally, unusually warm winter weather may reduce the commercial and residential needs for heat and electricity which, in turn, may reduce the demand for thermal coal; and\n\u2022Metallurgical coal demand: may be impacted adversely by economic downturns resulting in decreased demand for steel and an overall decline in steel production. A decline in blast furnace production of steel may reduce the demand for furnace coke, an intermediate product made from metallurgical coal. Decreased demand for metallurgical coal also may result from increased steel industry utilization of processes that do not use, or reduce the need for, furnace coke, such as electric arc furnaces, or blast furnace injection of pulverized coal or natural gas.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in the market price of coal can greatly affect production rates and investments by third-parties in the development of new and existing coal reserves. Mining activity may decrease as spot coal prices decrease. We have no control over the level of mining activity by coal producers, which may be affected by prevailing and projected coal prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of coal reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital. A material decrease in coal mining production in the areas of operation for our logistics\nbusiness, whether as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of coal processed through our logistics facilities, which would reduce our revenues and operating income.\nDecreased demand for thermal or metallurgical coals, and extended or substantial price declines for coal could adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations. The cash flows associated with our logistics business may decline unless we are able to secure new volumes of coal or other dry bulk products, by attracting additional customers to these operations. Future growth and profitability of our logistics business segment will depend, in part, upon whether we can contract for additional coal and other bulk commodity volumes at a rate greater than that of any decline in volumes from existing customers. Accordingly, decreased demand for coal, or other bulk commodities, or a decrease in the market price of coal, or other bulk commodities, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our logistics business.\nThe geographic location of the Convent Marine Terminal could expose us to potential significant liabilities, including operational hazards and unforeseen business interruptions, that could substantially and adversely affect our future financial performance.\nCMT is located in the Gulf Coast region, and its operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, including interruptions from hurricanes, floods, or other potential effects of climate change, which have historically impacted the region with some regularity. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nWe face material debt maturities which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position.\nOver the next five years, we have $127 million of total consolidated debt maturing. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. We may not be able to refinance this debt, or may be forced to do so on terms substantially less favorable than our currently outstanding debt. We may be forced to delay or not make capital expenditures, which may adversely affect our competitive position and financial results.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit facilities and other debt documents.\nSubject to the limits contained in our credit agreements and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, a higher level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and our other debt;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for the payment of dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our credit facilities contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities (such as incurring additional debt) that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt. In the event of an acceleration of all our debt, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the indebtedness in full. Such event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase, reducing our financial flexibility.\nIn the future, we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop or expand our facilities. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay distributions and make certain investments;\n\u2022a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged, and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and our industry; and\n\u2022a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, distributions or for general corporate or other purposes.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our common stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.\nRisks Related to Our Legacy Coal Mining Business\nOur former coal mining operations were subject to governmental regulations pertaining to employee health and safety and mandated benefits for retired coal miners. Following the divestiture of our coal mining operations, compliance with such regulations has continued to impose significant costs on our business.\nOur former coal mining operations were subject to strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters such as reclamation, and to matters such as employee health and safety and mandated benefits for retired coal miners. Even after divestiture of our coal mining business, compliance with these reclamation and benefits requirements has continued to impose significant costs on us. As a former coal mine operator, federal law requires us to secure payment of federal black lung benefits to claimants who were employees, and to contribute to a trust fund for payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry before January 1, 1970. At December 31, 2021, our liabilities for coal workers\u2019 black lung benefits totaled $63.3 million. Our business could be materially and adversely harmed if these liabilities, including the number and award size of claims, were increased. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Legal and Regulatory Requirements-Other Regulatory Requirements.\u201d\nGeneral Risks\nSustained uncertainty in financial markets, or unfavorable economic conditions in the industries in which our customers operate, may lead to a reduction in the demand for our products and services, and adversely impact our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nSustained volatility and disruption in worldwide capital and credit markets in the U.S. and globally could restrict our ability to access the capital market at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for potential acquisitions, or other growth opportunities.\nDeteriorating or unfavorable economic conditions in the industries in which our customers operate, such as steelmaking and electric power generation, may lead to reduced demand for steel products, coal, and other bulk commodities which, in turn, could adversely affect the demand for our products and services and negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our business.\nLabor disputes with the unionized portion of our workforce could affect us adversely. Union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.\nWe rely, at one or more of our facilities, on unionized labor, and there is always the possibility that we may be unable to reach agreement on terms and conditions of employment or renewal of a collective bargaining agreement. When collective bargaining agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to negotiate new agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements, or at all, and without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. If we are unable to negotiate the renewal of a collective bargaining agreement before its expiration date, our operations and our profitability could be adversely affected. A prolonged labor dispute, which may include a work stoppage, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our customers\u2019 orders and, as a result, adversely affect our operations, or the stability of production and reduce our future revenues, or profitability. It is also possible that, in the future, additional employee groups may choose to be represented by a labor union.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe have implemented recruitment, training and retention efforts to optimally staff our operations. Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects. With respect to our represented employees, we may be adversely impacted by the loss of employees who retire or obtain other employment during a layoff or a work stoppage.\nWe currently are, and likely will be, subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future, including disputes relating to our operations and commercial and contractual arrangements. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within our control. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate, but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability. In addition, our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future. We are also subject to significant environmental and other government regulation, which sometimes results in various administrative proceedings. For additional information, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nSecurity breaches and other information systems failures could disrupt our operations, compromise the integrity of our data, expose us to liability, cause increased expenses and cause our reputation to suffer, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business or financial position.\nOur business is dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including our enterprise resource planning tools. We process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems. If a key system were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, our operations and financial results could be affected adversely. Our systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach, terrorist attack, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar event. Our disaster recovery plans may not entirely prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. Our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers, on our networks, and in our cloud vendors. In addition, we rely on third party service providers, for support of our information technology systems, including the maintenance and integrity of proprietary business information and other confidential company information and data relating to customers, suppliers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have instituted data security measures for confidential company information and data stored on electronic and computing devices, whether owned or leased by us or a third party vendor. However, despite such measures, there are risks associated with customer, vendor, and other third-party access and our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to: employee error or malfeasance, failure of third parties to meet contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or other disruptions.\nAny such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings,\nliability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position.\nWe are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, interruptions to our computer and information technology systems and sophisticated cyber-attacks.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Cyber-attacks could materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber-attack could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but a cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe are or may become subject to privacy and data protection laws, rules and directives relating to the processing of personal data in the countries where we operate.\nThe growth of cyber-attacks has resulted in an evolving legal landscape which imposes costs that are likely to increase over time. For example, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and recent California legislation (which, among other things, provides for a private right of action), pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and could potentially elevate our costs over time. Any failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations could result in penalties and liabilities. It is also possible under certain legislation that if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.", "PERMNO": 12905, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "SXC"}
