{"cik": "1376339", "company": "MIMEDX GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves a substantial risk of loss. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. In this case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Audit Committee Investigation, Consolidated Financial Statements, Internal Controls and Related Matters\nWe have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting which resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018. If we fail to properly remediate these or any future material weaknesses or deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal controls, further material misstatements in our financial statements could occur and impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, preclude us from relisting our stock on a securities exchange, require significant expenditure of financial and other resources, give rise to litigation against us and otherwise affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOn December 4, 2018, Ernst & Young LLP (\u201cEY\u201d) notified the Audit Committee that EY was resigning from the engagement to audit the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, effective immediately. On the same date, EY also advised the Company that the internal controls necessary for the Company to develop reliable financial statements did not exist and identified additional matters involving operations that EY considered to be material weaknesses.\nAs discussed in the Explanatory Note to this Form 10-K, the Audit Committee Investigation concluded in May 2019 and found that the Company\u2019s previously issued consolidated financial statements and financial information relating to the Non-Reliance Periods would need to be restated and could no longer be relied upon due to accounting irregularities regarding the recognition of revenue under GAAP. The Investigation also identified additional material weaknesses arising out of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition practices and revenue management activities, material misstatements made by former members of Company management, actions taken against whistleblowers and an inappropriate tone set by former senior management.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2018 due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018 due to material weaknesses in our control over financial reporting, all as described in the Explanatory Note and Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Form 10-K.While we initiated meaningful remediation efforts during 2018 to address the identified weaknesses, we were not able to fully remediate our material weaknesses in internal controls as of December 31, 2018. Furthermore, while a substantial volume of additional control remediation measures were implemented between December 31, 2018 and the filing of this Form 10-K, we expect to conclude that these remediation efforts were not adequate to allow us to conclude that our control environment was effective and void of any material weaknesses as of December 31, 2019. One or more additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting might arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and, in doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues.\nIf our remediation measures are insufficient to address the identified deficiencies, or if additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal controls may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock, subject us to further regulatory investigations and penalties or shareholder litigation, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMatters relating to and arising out of the Audit Committee Investigation, including the accounting review of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and the audits of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, have been time consuming and expensive, and may result in additional expense.\nWe incurred significant expenses in connection with the Audit Committee Investigation, and we are continuing to incur significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the ongoing review of our accounting\npractices and systems, the audit of our financial statements and the remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, in connection with the Audit Committee Investigation, audit and compliance efforts and related litigation, the Company incurred Investigation, Restatement and related expenses in the aggregate amount of approximately $68.3 million and $51.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. To the extent our remediation efforts are unsuccessful or incomplete, or we identify additional problems requiring remediation, our management may be required to devote significant additional time to such efforts and we may be forced to incur significant additional expenses, including legal and accounting expenses. The incurrence of significant additional expense, or the requirement that management devote significant time that could reduce the time available to execute on our business strategies, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future, and our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all is uncertain.\nWe require capital to execute our strategic priorities, fund the costs associated with the Restatement and the near-term efforts by the Company to address certain contingent liabilities relating to pending and threatened lawsuits, pending governmental investigations and other legal proceedings.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe revenues generated by sales of our products\u037e\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts\u037e\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products\u037e\n\u2022\nthe costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies\u037e\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of certain products and products in development\u037e\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with capital expenditures, including those required in connection with our efforts to become cGMP compliant\u037e and\n\u2022\nunanticipated general and administrative expenses.\nWe do not have current financial statements and are not current in our SEC filings. Additionally, our Common Stock was delisted from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market in March 2019. As a result, we are significantly limited in our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt or equity capital. If we remain unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms, or at all, our liquidity may be limited in a manner that has an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf, in the future, we are able to issue equity or debt securities to raise capital, our existing shareholders may experience dilution, and any new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. In addition, if we raise capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to develop and expand our portfolio pipeline, advance our commercial strategy, enhance our business development efforts, advance our BLA programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressure, changes in our supplier relationships or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our long-range goals, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to substantial litigation and ongoing investigations that could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and result in harm to our business.\nWe are exposed to potential liabilities and reputational risk associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding proceedings that we believe may be material to the Company as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses to certain individuals involved in certain of these proceedings. Further, volatility in our stock price may also make us vulnerable to future class action litigation.\nAny adverse judgment in or settlement of any pending or any future litigation could result in payments, fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, legal proceedings\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant legal fees and expenses, diversion of management\u2019s time and other resources, and adverse publicity. Such proceedings could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Common Stock might not be relisted, or once relisted, it might not remain listed.\nBecause we are not current in filing our periodic reports with the SEC, we were unable to comply with the listing standards of Nasdaq, and our Common Stock was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market effective November 8, 2018 and was subsequently delisted effective March 8, 2019. After we have completed the Restatement and become current in our SEC reporting, we intend to apply to relist our Common Stock. However, we may not be able to do so in an expeditious manner or at all. We may be unable to relist our Common Stock, and even if our Common Stock is relisted, an active trading market may not develop or, if one develops, may not continue. The lack of an active trading market may limit the liquidity of an investment in our Common Stock, meaning you may not be able to sell any shares of Common Stock you own at times, or at prices, attractive to you. Any of these factors may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nMatters relating to or arising from the Restatement and the Audit Committee Investigation have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the Restatement and the results of the Investigation. As a result, our customers or others with whom we do business have voiced concerns regarding the effort required to address our accounting and control environment and the ability for us to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and our financial health.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $73 million of debt outstanding, including $73 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate debt pursuant to our Loan Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2019 (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, the guarantors and lenders party thereto, and Blue Torch Finance LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. For more information, see Note 21, \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our substantial outstanding debt may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or may adversely affect the terms on which such additional funds may be available. Additionally, a default under certain other indebtedness constitutes an event of default under the Loan Agreement. Consequently, the effects of a default under other debt may be amplified by the lender exercising the remedies available to them in the Loan Agreement for events of default, including foreclosure on the collateral securing our obligations and the declaration that all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement are immediately due and payable. The limitations on our ability to access additional borrowing and the potential effects of a cross-default under the Loan Agreement may limit our liquidity and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness under the Loan Agreement subjects us to interest rate risk, which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBorrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus a margin of 8.00% per annum or (if LIBOR is not available) a prime rate plus a margin of 7.00% per annum. As a result, we are exposed to interest rate risk, which we do not hedge. If LIBOR or the applicable prime rate rises, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement will increase. Therefore, an increase in LIBOR or the applicable prime rate will increase our interest payment obligations under the Loan Agreement and have a negative effect on our cash flows and liquidity, and could have a negative effect on our ability to make payments due under the Loan Agreement.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Loan Agreement and the Company\u2019s obligation to make debt payments under the Loan Agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Loan Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions and covenants, which may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends; and\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and consolidations, sale and leasebacks and asset dispositions.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the Loan Agreement, including financial covenants that limit our maximum total leverage and require adherence to a minimum liquidity requirement. For more information, refer to Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d We are also subject to certain reporting and performance obligations.\nSuch restrictive covenants in the Loan Agreement and the Company\u2019s repayment obligations under the Loan Agreement could have adverse consequences to the Company, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in operating our business and planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, the indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of the Loan Agreement and there is an event of default, the lender may foreclose upon the collateral securing our obligations under the Loan Agreement. To secure the performance of our obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries granted the lender a security interest in substantially all of its assets. The foreclosure on the collateral assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in the Loan Agreement, it could result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement, which could result in the lender declaring all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. For example, if the Company\u2019s net revenue decreases by more than 5% in 2020, the Company might exceed the applicable maximum leverage ratio permitted by the Loan Agreement during the second half of 2020. There can be no assurances that we will be able to repay all such amounts or able to find alternative financing in an event of a default. Even if alternative financing is available in an event of a default under the Loan Agreement, it may be on unfavorable terms, and the interest rate charged on any new borrowings could be substantially higher than the interest rate under the Loan Agreement, thus adversely affecting our cash flows, liquidity, and results of operations. Acceleration of the repayment of the loan pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, in combination with the Company\u2019s current commitments and contingent liabilities, could also cast doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we do not successfully execute our priorities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur priorities are to participate in the growth in the advanced wound care category, increase the Company\u2019s market share by demonstrating the positive health economics of our products, and accelerate the timeline to achieve our long-range growth objectives, including our BLA pipeline. We have sought and intend to continue to seek capital to implement our priorities, which include advancing our BLA programs and seeking FDA approval for micronized dHACM to treat musculoskeletal degeneration across multiple indications.\nIn developing our priorities, we evaluated many factors including, without limitation, those related to developments in our industry, customer demand, competition, regulatory developments, the ability of the Company to execute a capital raise and general economic conditions. Actual conditions may be different from our assumptions, and we may not be able to successfully execute our priorities or obtain capital on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not successfully execute our priorities, or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, managing our growth may be more difficult than we expect. We anticipate that a period of significant expansion will be required to penetrate and service the market for our existing and anticipated future products and to continue to develop new products. This expansion will place a significant strain on management and operational and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must both modify our existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and implement new systems, procedures and controls. We must also expand our finance, administrative and operations staff. Management may be unable to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage necessary personnel or to identify, manage and exploit existing and potential relationships and market opportunities.\nWe are in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from well-established tissue processors and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants.\nOur business is in a very competitive and evolving field. Competition from other tissue processors, medical device companies, and biotherapeutic companies, and from research and academic institutions, is intense, expected to increase and subject to rapid change and could be significantly affected by new product introductions. Established competitors and newer market entrants are investing in additional clinical research that may allow them to gain further clinician usage, adoption and payer coverage of their products. In addition, consolidation in the healthcare industry continues to give rise to demands for price concessions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, competitors may introduce amniotic membrane products in the future at lower prices, adding new features or gaining additional reimbursement coverage. Further, they may copy our products outside the United States. The presence of this competition may lead to pricing pressure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and, if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe technologies underlying our products are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. Others may develop services, products or processes with significant advantages over the products, services and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressure and technologies. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u2022\nacquire, through licensing, co-development or outright purchase, new technology developed outside of MiMedx;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products; and\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements.\nIf we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations and financial condition will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, or they may never receive required regulatory approval and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nOur products depend on the availability of tissue from human donors, and any disruption in supply could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our human tissue products depends upon, among other factors, the availability of tissue from human donors. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources will interfere with our ability to effectively meet demand for our products incorporating human tissue. The availability of donated tissue could also be adversely impacted by regulatory changes, public opinion of the donor process and our own reputation in the industry. Obtaining adequate supplies of human tissue involves several risks, including limited control over availability, quality and delivery schedules. In addition, any interruption in the supply of any human tissue component could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHealth epidemics in regions where we have operations, sales and marketing teams, manufacturing facilities or other business operations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant epidemics or other disruptions to public health, including the novel coronavirus or COVID-19, could harm our operations and increase our costs and expenses in numerous ways. If our leadership, employees, sales agents, suppliers, medical professionals, or users of our products are impacted by an epidemic by illness or through social distancing, quarantine or other precautionary measures, our manufacturing operations, clinical trials, sales, and demand for our product may be adversely affected. Additionally, if we experience shortages of donated placentas because donors or our recovery specialists are excluded from hospitals, or because donated tissues are screened as ineligible under AATB or other standards, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Disruptions to the health care system also may adversely affect our business if health care providers restrict access to their facilities by our sales personnel for a material amount of time (and we have begun to receive notices from some of our hospital customers who are restricting access to only essential personnel, if patients are unable or unwilling to visit health care providers, or if health care providers prioritize treatment of acute or communicable illnesses over wound care. If the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread domestically or internationally, the risks described herein could be elevated significantly. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our senior leadership team and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and success are materially dependent on attracting and retaining members of our senior leadership team to formulate and execute the Company\u2019s business plans. Since June 2018, we have needed to replace a number of our senior leadership team members including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Controller, and General Counsel and Secretary. We had an interim CEO from July 2018 until Mr. Wright was appointed CEO effective May 13, 2019, and we had an interim CFO from June 2018 to November 2019. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, our interim CFO continues to serve as acting CFO. See discussion above under \u201cBusiness-Recent Developments.\u201d Since early 2018, we have experienced difficulties in recruiting due to legal and business uncertainties resulting from the issues which were the subject of the Audit Committee Investigation.\nLeadership changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause material disruption to our business or management team. Changes in senior management could also lead to an environment that presents additional challenges in recruiting and retaining employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, including sales, managerial and technical personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find and attract additional qualified employees to support our expected growth or retain any such personnel. We have experienced higher than normal attrition in our general workforce since June 2018. Our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of services of our key personnel may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenues and accounts receivable come from government accounts.\nWe have significant sales to the government (whether we are selling our products directly to government accounts or through a distributor). Any disruption of our products on the Federal Supply Schedule (\u201cFSS\u201d), or of the use of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts, or any change in the way the government purchases products like ours or the price it is willing to pay for our products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, competitive pricing pressures and any non-compliance with applicable guidelines could cause the Company to lose existing or future contracts with the VA, which may result in an overall decline in revenue.\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its pre- and post-award VA sales under its FSS contract and, at December 31, 2018, had accrued an obligation of $6.9 million in connection with a potential issue that it self-disclosed to the VA concerning the eligibility of one of its products for inclusion in the Company\u2019s FSS contract. See Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d below. As discussed below in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d the Company has reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter for an amount within the Company\u2019s reserve. However, any resulting negative impact to our contractual relationship with the VA going forward may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues depend on adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\nOur success depends on the extent to which our customers receive adequate reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private insurers and health systems. Government and other third-party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of medical products, particularly new products. Therefore, significant uncertainty usually exists as to the reimbursement status of new healthcare products by third-party payers. Although EpiFix has coverage with the majority of payers, a significant number of public and private insurers and health systems currently do not cover or reimburse our other products. If we are not successful in obtaining adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products from these third-party payers, it could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our products. Inadequate reimbursement levels would likely also create downward price pressure on our products. Even if we do succeed in obtaining widespread coverage and reimbursement rates or policies for our products, future changes in coverage or reimbursement rates or policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, through its rule-making process, CMS has requested stakeholder comments on the reimbursement methodology under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System for an episode of wound care for future years. In other words, the Medicare reimbursement payment methodology may change after 2020 in the hospital outpatient setting from the current reimbursement methodology, which is based on a bundled payment amount per wound care application (i.e. per skin substitute application), to a fixed, global payment to treat the wound until it is healed (i.e. a lump sum payment that covers the entire wound care episode). We are unable to assess the potential effects of these reimbursement changes on our business at this time, as it is not clear if any changes will take effect and CMS has not disclosed specific reimbursement details for a wound episode model. We are and will continue to participate in discussions with CMS on potential solutions for future wound episode reimbursement models.\nFurther, we have experienced some reluctance by payers to cover products for applications other than those we have published clinical trials. For example, Noridian, the MAC for 13 states, published a Local Coverage Article effective November 8, 2018 that limits coverage for amniotic membrane derived skin substitute products to diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers only. Prior to the published article, Noridian did not have a written policy on the matter, which provided a pathway for physicians to utilize amniotic membrane derived skin substitute products, such as ours, based on medical necessity in a wide variety of wounds. Currently, there are three MACs that do not have a written medical policy in the form of a Local Coverage Determination (\u201cLCD\u201d) or article. If the three MACs created written medical policy criteria, this could limit providers to the use of products that have published clinical evidence for a specific wound type. As a result of the Noridian published article, our revenues for 2019 declined significantly compared to 2018. Our future revenues could experience additional declines if other MACs or other payers further limit their coverage of our products. This decline would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a GPO or IDN.\nAs with many manufacturers in the healthcare space, the Company contracts with GPOs and IDNs to establish contracted pricing and terms and conditions for the members of GPOs and IDNs. Approximately two-thirds of our sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 came from customers that are members of our main GPOs or IDNs.\nOur agreements with GPOs and IDNs allow us to sell our products efficiently to large groups of customers. Our agreements with GPOs and IDNs typically provide their members with favorable ordering terms and conditions and access to favorable product pricing. These customers purchase our product through GPO and IDN arrangements in part because of favorable pricing and terms and conditions. If our agreement with any GPO or IDN is terminated or expires without being extended, renewed or renegotiated this could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe contract with independent sales agents and distributors.\nIn 2018, we derived approximately 15% of our sales through our relationships with independent agents and distributors. (Sales agents act directly on behalf of MiMedx to arrange sales, while distributors take title to product and may set their own prices.) See Note 17, \u201c Revenue Date by Customer Type.\u201d\nBecause our agents and distributors are not employees, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, compliance safeguards, and related policies will be adhered to despite our communication of these requirements. If we fail to maintain\nrelationships with our key independent agents, or fail to ensure that our independent agents adhere to our sales processes, compliance safeguards and related policies, there could be an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAlso, if our relationships with our independent sales agents or distributors were terminated for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits. Because the independent agent often controls the customer relationships within its territory, there is a risk that if our relationship with the agent ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost.\nWe may obtain the assistance of additional distributors and independent sales representatives to sell products in certain sales channels, particularly in territories and fields where agents are commonly used. Our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our independent sales agencies, distributors, and their representatives to appropriately and compliantly sell our products in certain territories or fields. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans or compliance safeguards. Some of our independent sales agencies and distributors do not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other companies. Our independent sales agencies and distributors may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also may not be able to find additional independent sales agencies and distributors who will agree to appropriately and compliantly market or distribute our products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish new independent sales representative and distribution relationships or renew current sales agency and distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDisruption of our processing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends upon the continued operation of our processing facilities in Marietta, Georgia and Kennesaw, Georgia. Risks that could impact our ability to use these facilities include the occurrence of natural and other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements of directives from government agencies, including the FDA. Either of our processing facilities can serve as a redundant processing facility for our Section 361 products in the event the other facility experiences a disaster event. We have made efforts to transition manufacturing into compliance with cGMPs for commercial production for our injectable product. These efforts are concentrated at our Kennesaw, Georgia facility. However, the unavailability of our processing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations during the period of such unavailability.\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince physicians, where appropriate, that our products are proper alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.\nWe believe physicians will only use our products if they determine, based on their independent medical judgment and experience, clinical data, and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of our products in a particular procedure is a favorable alternative to other treatments. Physicians may be hesitant to change their existing medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\ntheir lack of experience with prior procedures in the field using our products;\n\u2022\nlack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits of our products over conventional methods in certain therapeutic applications;\n\u2022\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of reimbursement from third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nthe time that must be dedicated to physician training in the use of our products.\nIf we cannot successfully address quality issues that may arise with our products, our brand and reputation could suffer, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products, as any quality issues or defects may negatively impact physician use of our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted. We must also ensure any promotional claims made for our products comport with government regulations.\nThe formation of physician-owned distributorships (\u201cPODs\u201d) could result in increased pricing pressure on our products or harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with those distributorships.\nPODs are medical product distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. These physicians derive a proportion of their revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical products for use in procedures they perform on their own patients at hospitals that agree to purchase from or through the POD, or that otherwise furnish ordering physicians with income that is based directly or indirectly on those orders of medical products. The Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of the Department of Health & Human Services has issued a Special Fraud Alert on PODs, indicating that they are inherently suspect under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nOur commercial strategy emphasizes selling directly to healthcare providers and, to a limited extent, through distributors. To our knowledge, we do not directly sell to or distribute any of our products through PODs. The number of PODs in the industry may continue to grow as economic pressures increase throughout the industry and hospitals, insurers and physicians search for ways to reduce costs, and, in the case of the physicians, search for ways to increase their incomes. These companies and the physicians who own, or partially own, PODs have significant market knowledge and access to the physicians who use our products and the hospitals that purchase our products, and we may not be able to compete effectively for business from physicians who own PODs.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing and marketing of human tissue products. We may be subject to such claims if our products cause, or appear to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers or others selling our products. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or reduced acceptance of, our products in the market.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations, and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. If we are unable to maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business.\nThe products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.\nThe utilization of human tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease, including, without limitation, human immunodeficiency virus, viral hepatitis, syphilis and other viral, fungal or bacterial pathogens. We are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission.\nWe maintain strict quality controls designed in accordance with cGTP to ensure the safe procurement and processing of our tissue. These controls are intended to prevent the transmission of communicable disease. However, risks exist with any human tissue implantation. We are also in the process of attempting to develop and enhance cGMP systems to comply with the regulations that will apply to our Section 351 HCT/Ps following the end of the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion period under the Guidance. In addition, negative publicity concerning disease transmission from other companies\u2019 improperly processed donated tissue could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation, disrupt our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe processing and marketing of our tissue products involves an inherent risk that our tissue products or processes do not meet applicable quality standards and requirements. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall or market withdrawal of one of our products would be costly and would divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or as a result of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nA breach of cybersecurity, a disruption in availability, or the unauthorized alteration of systems or data could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on technology for day-to-day operations as well as positioning to\nenhance our stance in the market. We generate intellectual property that is central to the future success of the business and transmit large amounts of confidential information. Additionally, we collect, store and transmit confidential information of customers, patients, employees and third parties. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The continually changing threat landscape of cybersecurity today makes our systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners, and vendors, and from attacks by malicious third parties, including supply chain attacks originating at our third-party partners. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication. Attacks are made by individuals or groups that have varying levels of expertise, some of which are technologically advanced and well-funded including, without limitation, nation states, organized criminal groups and hacktivists organizations.\nTo ensure protection of our information, we have invested in cybersecurity and have implemented processes and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. We measure these controls and their success through a cybersecurity framework that is based on industry standards. While we have invested in the protection of our data and technology, there can be no guarantees that our efforts will prevent all service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal and reputational harm to our business, including legal claims and proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties, as well as remediation costs. We maintain cyber liability insurance. However, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nWe may expand or contract our business through acquisitions, divestitures, licenses, investments, and other commercial arrangements in other companies or technologies, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire or divest companies, divisions, technologies, products, and rights through licenses, distribution agreements, investments, and outright acquisitions to grow our business. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute the value of equity currently held by our shareholders\u037e\n\u2022\ndivest or license existing products or technology;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nincur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay;\n\u2022\nstructure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u2022\nbe unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\u2022\nbe unable to secure the services of key employees related to the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nbe unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition.\nAny of these items could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Business acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business, which could be material. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could adversely affect our business if we are unable to recover our initial investment. Inability to recover our investment, or any write off of such investment, associated goodwill or assets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international expansion and operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe may consider further expansion outside the U.S. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that could be different than those faced by us in the United States. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws, including, without limitation, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered\nby the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Additionally, MiMedx and our international distributors are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Anti-Bribery statures. Additionally, international regulations on allowable promotional claims make the promotion of our products more difficult.\nCompliance with these regulations and law is costly, and failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, without limitation, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nThese risks may limit or disrupt our expansion, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation. Operating outside of the U.S. also requires significant management attention and financial resources.\nIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\nProducts subject to the FDA\u2019s BLA requirements must comply with a range of pre- and post-market provisions. Pre-market compliance includes the conduct of clinical trials in support of BLA approval, the development and submission of a BLA, and the production of product for use in the clinical trials that meets FDA\u2019s quality expectations. Post-approval requirements for BLA products include compliance with cGMPs, which will require us to make enhancements in our fixed plant as well as incur regular costs and reduced product yields from testing products to ensure identity, strength, quality and purity; compliance with promotional and labeling requirements, which limit our ability to make claims about regulated products\u037e submission of annual reports in appropriate circumstances\u037e compliance with the FDA\u2019s \u201cBiological Product Deviation Reporting System,\u201d when applicable\u037e \u201csubmission of adverse events\u037e\u201d reporting and correcting product problems within established timeframes\u037e recalling or stopping the manufacture of a product if a significant problem is detected\u037e complying with the appropriate laws and regulations relevant to the biologics license\u037e and identifying any changes needed to help ensure product quality. In some instances, the FDA can also require that applicants conduct post-market studies or trials of the product. This additional compliance burden may increase costs, and failure to comply with such requirements may subject the Company to sanctions that would have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or are evolving. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, including our licensed technology. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. Our pending patent applications might not result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. Although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with some of our officers, employees, consultants and advisors, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Whether a patent claim is valid is a complex matter of science, facts and law, and therefore we cannot be certain that, if challenged, our patent claims would be upheld. If any of those patent claims are invalidated, our competitive advantage may be reduced or eliminated.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon our licensed or pending patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation to enforce our patents subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. Other companies or entities also have commenced, and may again commence, actions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents and certain related claims. In the event that any of our patents claims are challenged, a court, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), or the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) of the USPTO may invalidate one or more challenged patent claims or determine that the patent is unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If the USPTO or the PTAB ultimately cancels or narrows the claim scope of any of our patents through these proceedings, it could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce them against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for information regarding our ongoing patent infringement lawsuits and related inter partes review proceedings.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in enforcing and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in some countries may be inadequate.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages.\nThird parties could assert that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a product infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there also may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products or processes infringe. There also may be existing patents or pending patent applications of which we are unaware that our products or processes may inadvertently infringe.\nAny infringement claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patent claims at issue in such a dispute were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from selling any product that is found to infringe those claims unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the asserted patent claims or other intellectual property, or are able to design around the patent claim or claims at issue or other intellectual property. We may be unable to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. A court could also order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, or selling products, and could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial measures. Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or tissue companies. We may also hire additional employees who are currently employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or tissue companies, including our competitors. Additionally, consultants or other independent agents with which we may contract may be or have been in a contractual\narrangement with one or more of our competitors. Although no claims are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to market existing or new products, which could severely harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Products and Other Government Regulations\nTo the extent our products do not qualify for regulation as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, this could result in removal of the applicable products from the market, would make the introduction of new tissue products more expensive and would significantly delay the expansion of our tissue product offerings and subject us to additional post-market regulatory requirements.\nThe products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue. Amniotic and other birth tissue is generally regulated as an HCT/P and is therefore eligible for regulation solely as a Section 361 HCT/P depending on whether the specific product at issue and the claims made for it are consistent with the applicable criteria. HCT/Ps that do not meet these criteria are subject to more extensive regulation as drugs, medical devices, biological products, or combination products. These HCT/Ps must comply with both the FDA\u2019s requirements for HCT/Ps and the requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including pre-market clearance or approval from the FDA. Obtaining FDA pre-market clearance or approval involves significant time and investment by the Company.\nIn November 2017, the FDA released a guidance document entitled \u201cRegulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue - Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\u201d The document confirmed the FDA\u2019s stance that all micronized amniotic products require a biologics license to be lawfully marketed in the United States. It also indicated that sheet forms of amniotic tissue are appropriately regulated as solely Section 361 HCT/Ps when manufactured in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and intended for use as a barrier or covering. The final guidance also stated that the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions with respect to the IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps for a period of 36 months from the date of the guidance. The FDA\u2019s approach is risk-based, and the guidance clarified that high-risk products and uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action. MiMedx continues to market AmnioFix Injectable and other micronized products under the policy of enforcement discretion as it works on the transition from Section 361 products to Section 351 products. Our sales of micronized products for all uses was $23.0 million, $45.0 million and $68.4 million, respectively, in 2016, 2017, and 2018. At the same time, we are pursuing the BLA pre-market approval process for certain of our micronized products, as more fully discussed under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d It is unclear whether all of our micronized products will be deemed to be Section 351 products following the end of the enforcement discretion period.\nFollowing the period of enforcement discretion under the Guidance, we may need to cease selling our micronized, injectable products and other products regulated under Section 351 until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market such products for indications that have been approved in a BLA. The loss of our ability to market and sell our micronized, injectable products would have an adverse impact on our revenues, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we expect the cost to manufacture our products will increase due to the costs to comply with the requirements that apply to Section 351 biological products such as current cGMP and ongoing product testing costs. Increased costs relating to regulatory compliance could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA might, at some future point, modify the scope of its enforcement discretion or change its position on which current or future products qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps, or determine that some or all of our micronized products may not be lawfully marketed under the FDA\u2019s policy of enforcement discretion. Any regulatory changes could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business by requiring pre-market clearance or approval and compliance with additional post-market regulatory requirements with respect to those products. It is also possible that the FDA could decide it will not allow the Company to market any form of a micronized product during the rest of the 36-month enforcement discretion period without a biologics license, and it could even require the Company to recall its micronized products. Further, under the November 2017 guidance, the FDA expressed its expectation that following the expiration of its 36-month enforcement discretion period, sales of micronized amniotic tissue will be limited to those products and indications for which applicants have received a BLA. In April 2019, we announced that we will need more time to file and commercialize our BLAs with the FDA and that clinical trial protocol enhancements, further resources and additional capabilities and expertise will be required for commercial\nlaunch. While we do not track all uses of our micronized products by physicians, we believe that our micronized product is being used by physicians for more indications than those for which we presently intend to pursue BLAs, as well as in additional sizes (e.g. 100 mg). If the FDA does allow the Company to continue to market a micronized form of its sheet allografts without a biologics license, the FDA may impose conditions, such as labeling restrictions and the requirement that the product be manufactured in compliance with cGMP. Although the Company is preparing for these requirements in connection with its pursuit of a BLA for certain of its micronized products, earlier compliance with these conditions would require significant additional time and cost investments by the Company.\nMoreover, increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate could lead to increased regulation of HCT/Ps, including Section 361 HCT/Ps, which could ultimately increase our costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the FDA approves the BLAs we seek, we will incur increased compliance costs on an ongoing basis. See \u201cIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\u201d\nObtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals for certain of our products will be expensive and time consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a biological product or medical device from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the USA may be costly and time consuming, and such clearances or approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. We are pursuing approval of BLAs for certain of our micronized products, but have not yet submitted a BLA for review. Additionally, the FDA may take the position that some of the other products that we currently market require a BLA as well. Some of the future products and enhancements to our current products that we expect to develop and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA. However, clearance or approval may not be granted with respect to any of our products or enhancements and FDA review will involve delays that may adversely affect our ability to market such products or enhancements.\nThe process of obtaining an approved BLA requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete. The fee for filing a BLA and program fees payable with respect to any establishment that manufactures biologics are substantial. Additionally, there are significant costs associated with clinical trials that can be difficult to accurately estimate until a BLA is approved. Clinical trials may not be successful or may return results that do not support approval. Moreover, data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, or we may decide not to pursue a BLA for certain products or indications. Additionally, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. If we do receive approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Our revenues will be adversely affected if we fail to obtain BLA approvals on a timely basis or at all, if the FDA requires us to stop marketing our products until a BLA is approved, or if the FDA limits the indications for use or places other conditions that restrict the commercial application of our products.\nFurther, in April 2019, we announced that we will need more time to develop and file our BLAs with the FDA and that clinical trial protocol enhancements, further resources, and additional capabilities and expertise will be required for commercial launch. We expect that we will have to increase enrollment in our current clinical trials, or initiate new ones, which will add expense, time, and additional uncertainty to the overall BLA approval process.\nIf the BLAs we seek are approved, we will incur increased compliance costs on an ongoing basis. See \u201cIf any of the BLAs are approved, the Company would be subject to additional regulation which will increase costs and could result in adverse sanctions for non-compliance.\u201d\nOur business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities, which is costly, and our failure to comply could result in negative effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, the FDA has specific regulations governing our tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers, even for Section 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products, donor screening and testing, processing and distribution, labeling, record keeping and adverse-reaction reporting, and inspection and enforcement.\nHCT/Ps that are regulated as drugs, biological products or medical devices are subject to even more stringent regulation by the FDA. Even if pre-market clearance or approval is obtained, the approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the\nindications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed, may require warnings to accompany the product or impose additional restrictions on the sale or use of the product. In addition, regulatory approval is subject to continuing compliance with regulatory standards, including the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA regulations regarding our tissue products or medical devices, the FDA could take enforcement action, including, without limitation, any of the following sanctions and the manufacture of our products or processing of our tissue could be delayed or terminated:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, cease and desist orders, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing our requests for clearance or approval of new products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing or suspending current applications for approval or approvals already granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps may continue to evolve. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks (\u201cAATB\u201d) has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an accredited tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations.\nIn addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks, hospitals and physicians for their services associated with the recovery and storage of donated human tissue. Although we have independent third party appraisals that confirm the reasonableness of the service fees we pay, if we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we potentially would be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFinally, we and other manufacturers of skin substitutes are required to provide average selling price (\u201cASP\u201d) information to CMS on a quarterly basis. The Medicare payment rates are updated quarterly based on this ASP information. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, such manufacturer is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied, and potential False Claims Act liability, including treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at between $11,181 and $22,363 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\nAs a general rule, we can only market our 361 HCT/Ps for appropriate homologous uses and we can only promote pre-approved biological products or devices for FDA-approved indications. Generally, unless the products are approved or cleared by the FDA for alternative uses, the FDA contends that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products, or promote them, for such uses. Such limitations present a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales, marketing and support activities, though designed to comply with all FDA requirements, constitute the promotion of our products for an unapproved use in violation of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We also face the risk that the FDA or other governmental authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nInvestigations concerning the promotion of unapproved uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of the law, we may face significant legal\naction, fines, penalties, and even criminal liability and may be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities. There is also a possibility that we could be enjoined from selling some or all of our products for any unapproved use. In addition, as a result of an enforcement action against us or any of our executive officers, we could be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nHowever, the FDA\u2019s Guidance stated that the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions with respect to IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps through November 2020. This means that, through November 2020, the FDA does not intend to enforce certain provisions as they currently apply to certain entities or activities. During the period of enforcement discretion, we have marketed, and intend to continue to market, our micronized, injectable products while at the same time pursuing a BLA for certain of our micronized products. We have already filed INDs for three indications for our micronized, injectable product: plantar fasciitis, osteoarthritis knee pain, and Achilles tendonitis.\nNevertheless, while we believe we are in compliance with the FDA's Guidance on HCT/Ps and enforcement discretion regarding products that do not meet some or all of the HCT/P requirements, there can be no assurance that we are correct or that the FDA will not suspend its enforcement discretion and, in such cases, we may need to discontinue marketing a product and/or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved uses.\nWe and our sales representatives, whether employees or independent contractors, must comply with various federal and state anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, any breach of which could cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under various federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex and, in some instances, even minor or inadvertent violations can give rise to liability. Possible sanctions for violation of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participating in the federal and state healthcare programs, including, without limitation, Medicare, Medicaid, VA health programs and TRICARE (the healthcare program administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed service members, including both those in active duty and retirees, as well as their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. A finding of a violation of one or more of these laws, or even a government investigation or inquiry into the same, would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock, as well as on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal law that prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward referrals, purchases or orders or arranging for or recommending the purchase, order or referral of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, so that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. A conviction for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute results in criminal fines and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry practices from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor. We have entered into consulting agreements, speaker agreements, research agreements and product development agreements with physicians, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. In addition, some of these physicians own our stock, which they purchased in arm\u2019s-length transactions on terms identical to those offered to non-physicians, or received stock awards from us in the past as consideration for services performed by them. While we believe these transactions generally met the requirements of applicable laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and analogous state laws, it is possible that our arrangements with physicians and other providers may be questioned by regulatory or enforcement authorities under such laws, which could lead us to redesign the arrangements and subject us to significant civil or criminal penalties. We have designed our policies and procedures to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the FCA, and industry norms. In addition, we have conducted training sessions on these principles. If, however, regulatory or enforcement authorities were to view these arrangements as non-compliant with applicable laws, there would be risk of government investigations or penalties. There is also risk that one or more of our employees or agents will disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our products, perform clinical research on our behalf or educate other health care professionals about the efficacy and uses of our products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with physicians who refer or order or promote our products to be in violation of applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the physicians we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with\nthese laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA and TRICARE.\nThe federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that knowingly submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity to sue on behalf of the government to recover civil penalties and treble damages as a whistleblower. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.\nManufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) on behalf of the government has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors, violated the FCA, resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into onerous corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions, as well as oversight and review by an outside entity, an Independent Review Organization (\u201cIRO\u201d), at substantial expense to the Company.\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) criminal federal healthcare fraud statute, it is a crime to knowingly and willfully execute, or attempt to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.\nThere are federal and state laws requiring detailed reporting of manufacturer interactions with and payments to healthcare providers, such as the Sunshine Act. The Sunshine Act requires, among others, \u201capplicable manufacturers\u201d of drugs, devices, biological products, and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to \u201ccovered recipients.\u201d The term covered recipients includes U.S.-licensed physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. While manufacturers of human cell and tissue products regulated solely under Section 361 are not subject to the Sunshine Act, in the future, if we receive a BLA, we will be subject to this law. There is also risk that CMS or another government agency may take the position that our products are not human cell and tissue products regulated solely under Section 361, and thereby assert that we are currently subject to the Sunshine Act, which could subject us to civil penalties and the administrative burden of having to comply with the law.\nThere are state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers (i.e., so called \u201call-payer\u201d anti-kickback laws).\nThe enforcement of all of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities may investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and even criminal sanctions if we are deemed to have made a misstatement of compliance to a federal agency.\nProducts that are subject to pre-approval as biologicals must also be manufactured in accord with cGMP. In August 2013, the FDA sent the Company an Untitled Letter asserting that its micronized amniotic allografts were unapproved biologics. The Company disputed the FDA\u2019s position at the time and filed various appeals but ultimately agreed during the appeals process to pursue BLAs for certain products, but the transition to cGMP compliance for micronized, injectable products sold commercially was a larger task. In February 2016, the FDA inspected the Company\u2019s Marietta facility against cGMP requirements for the commercially available product. The transition to cGMP compliance was underway, but the work was in its initial stages. At the close of the inspection, the FDA issued a Form 483 that included 13 observations. In response, the Company developed an action plan (the \u201cAction Plan\u201d). The Action Plan, which was shared with FDA, called for a systematic approach to the work and provided a vehicle\nto update the FDA on progress. Over the course of the next year, the site did substantial work to transition to cGMP for the commercially available, micronized, injectable product and filed several updates with the FDA.\nIn February 2017, the Company sent a close-out letter to the FDA that indicated the work under the Action Plan had been completed. That letter overstated our state of compliance in regard to the commercially available product. The goal of the letter was to communicate the substantial progress to the FDA and to indicate that the work under the Action Plan had been completed. The site continues to transition to cGMP compliance for its micronized products, and we expect to complete the work by November 2020, when the FDA\u2019s industrywide exercise of enforcement discretion for products like our micronized amnion expires. Exaggeration or misstatement of compliance to a federal agency creates regulatory risk. If the government were to take issue with the letter, it could take any number of actions adverse to the Company. These include issuing a warning letter, terminating the current exercise of enforcement discretion with respect to the sale of micronized products and initiating a civil judicial action against the Company and opening a criminal investigation. Each of these potential actions would be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, consume considerable resources and potentially prohibit sales of certain products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2019, the Company formally notified the FDA that its February 2017 correspondence overstated the Company\u2019s state of cGMP compliance.\nIn December 2019, the FDA conducted a cGMP audit of each of the Company\u2019s two manufacturing facilities. At the close of the inspection the FDA issued two Form 483s (one for each facility). The Company timely responded to the Form 483s. See the discussion under \u201cItem 1. Business - Processing (Manufacturing).\u201d\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the U.S. federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. In the U.S., the PPACA was enacted in 2010 with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several provider types, including hospitals.\nThe current U.S. Presidential Administration and certain members of the U.S. Congress have stated that they will seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. In 2017, the U.S. President signed an executive order which stated that it is the policy of his Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the PPACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of the PPACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Additionally, the House and Senate attempted, but failed, to pass legislation to repeal all or portions of the PPACA, and these efforts may be resumed. In December 2017, the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among numerous other actions, repealed the individual mandate of the PPACA, effective on January 1, 2019. In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the PPACA. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the PPACA were also invalid, though the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the PPACA. The court\u2019s ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On March 25, 2019, the DOJ reversed its prior position and stated in a legal filing with the Fifth Circuit that the district court\u2019s ruling that the PPACA was invalid should be upheld. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to reassess how much of the PPACA would be damaged without the individual mandate provision, and if the individual mandate could indeed be severed. In January 2020, 21 state Attorneys General urged the Supreme Court of the United States to decide whether or not the PPACA should be struck down as unconstitutional, claiming that the Fifth Circuit erroneously remanded the case to the district court. The House of Representatives filed a similar petition and motion. The state Attorneys General and the House of Representatives also filed motions to expedite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to review the case, which the Supreme Court subsequently denied. This litigation is still ongoing, and places great uncertainty upon the longevity and nature of the PPACA moving forward. In addition, further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under PPACA remain possible.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to the impact the U.S. Administration, the executive order, and the attempted legislation may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare\nitems and services, including our products. We believe that substantial uncertainty remains regarding the net effect of the PPACA, or its repeal and potential replacement, on our business, including uncertainty over how benefit plans purchased on exchanges will cover our products, how the expansion or contraction of the Medicaid program will affect access to our products, the effect of risk-sharing payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations and other value-based purchasing programs on coverage for our product, and the effect of the general increase or decrease in federal oversight of healthcare payers. The taxes imposed and the expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry under the PPACA, if unchanged, may result in decreased revenues, lower reimbursements by payers for our products and reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\nWe currently market our products internationally and intend to consider expansion of our international marketing. International jurisdictions require separate regulatory approvals and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing. Certain of our products require clearance or approval by the FDA. However, such clearance or approval does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or certifications and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign jurisdiction. Furthermore, many foreign jurisdictions operate under socialized medical care, and obtaining reimbursement for our products under that construct may also prove difficult. If we fail to receive necessary approvals, certifications, or reimbursements necessary to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFederal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information may increase our costs and limit our ability to collect and use that information and subject us to liability if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nNumerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. These laws include:\n\u2022\nprovisions of HIPAA that limit how covered entities and business associates may use and disclose protected health information, provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information and impose certain security requirements\u037e\n\u2022\nHITECH, which strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rules, imposed data breach notification obligations, created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions\u037e\n\u2022\nother federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA\u037e\n\u2022\nfederal and state consumer protection laws\u037e and\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws regulating the conduct of research with human subjects.\nOne relevant state law is the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA is a privacy bill that requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose information regarding the collection and use of a consumer\u2019s personal data and to delete a consumer\u2019s data upon request. The Act also permits the imposition of civil penalties and expands existing state security laws by providing a private right of action for consumers in certain circumstances where consumer data is subject to a breach. We are still evaluating whether and how this rule will impact our U.S. operations and /or limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services.\nAs part of our business operations, including our medical record keeping, third-party billing and reimbursement and research and development activities, we collect and maintain protected health information in paper and electronic format. Standards related to health information, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, HITECH, state laws, federal or state action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle personal information, including healthcare-related data, and communicate with payers, providers, patients, donors and others, and compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us.\nIf we are alleged not to comply with existing or new laws, rules and regulations related to personal information, we could be subject to litigation and to sanctions that include monetary fines, civil or administrative penalties, civil damage awards or criminal penalties.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock has been delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, which may negatively impact the trading price of our Common Stock and the levels of liquidity available to our shareholders.\nThe trading of our Common Stock was suspended from the Nasdaq Capital Market in November 2018 and delisted in March 2019. It is currently quoted on the \u201cover the counter\u201d market operated by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \u201cMDXG,\u201d which may negatively impact the trading price of our Common Stock and the liquidity available to our shareholders.\nOur Common Stock is subject to SEC rules and regulations relating to the market for penny stocks. A penny stock is any equity security not traded on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. On March 12, 2020, the last sale price per share of our Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets was $4.95. If our Common Stock is or becomes subject to regulation as a penny stock, such regulations may severely affect the market liquidity for our Common Stock and could limit the ability of shareholders to sell securities in the secondary market. Accordingly, investors in our Common Stock may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that our Common Stock will continue to be eligible for trading or quotation on the over the counter market or any other alternative exchanges or markets.\nFurther, the delisting of our Common Stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital through public or private sales of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our Common Stock. Such delisting may also have other negative effects, including the potential loss of confidence of employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, and fewer business development opportunities. Furthermore, because of the limited market and low volume of trading in the our Common Stock that could occur, the share price of our Common Stock could be disproportionately affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties.\nThe price of our Common Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our Common Stock, like that of the securities of many other healthcare companies that are engaged in research, development, and commercialization, has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future. The market price of our Common Stock could be impacted by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies or of the markets generally;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully launch, market and earn significant revenue from our products;\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional financing to support our continuing operations;\n\u2022\nDisclosure of the details and results of regulatory applications and proceedings;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in and disclosure or publicity regarding existing or new litigation or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations or our failure to comply with any such regulations;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nOur investments in research and development or other corporate resources;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in the patents or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including any restatements of previously reported results;\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively and consistently manufacture our products and avoid costs associated with the recall of defective or potentially defective products;\n\u2022\nOur ability and the ability of our distribution partners to market and sell our products;\n\u2022\nChanges in reimbursement for our products or the price for our products to our customers;\n\u2022\nRemoval of our products from the Federal Supply Schedule, or changes in how government accounts purchase products such as ours or in the price for our products to government accounts;\n\u2022\nMaterial amounts of short-selling of our Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nThe other risks detailed in this Item 1A.\nPrice volatility or a decrease in the market price of our Common Stock could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital, liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in revenue or results of operations could cause additional volatility in our stock price.\nAny unanticipated shortfall in our revenue in any fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in that quarter. The effect on our net income of such a shortfall could be exacerbated by the relatively fixed nature of most of our costs, which primarily include personnel costs as well as facilities costs. These fluctuations could cause the trading price of our stock to be negatively affected. Our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently expect to use available funds and any future earnings in the development, operation and expansion of our business and, to the extent authorized by our Board, repurchasing our Common Stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be an investor\u2019s only source of potential gain from our Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nCertain provisions of Florida law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders, which could affect our share price adversely and prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act (the \u201cFBCA\u201d) includes several provisions applicable to the Company that may discourage potential acquirors. Such provisions include provisions that allow directors to take other stakeholders into account in discharging their duties, a requirement that certain transactions with a shareholder of 10% or more ownership must be approved by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the other shareholders unless approved by a majority of the disinterested directors or certain fair price requirements are met and voting rights acquired by a shareholder at ownership levels at or above one-fifth, one-third and a majority of voting power are denied unless authorized by the Board prior to such acquisition or by a majority of the other shareholders (excluding interested shares (as defined in the FBCA)).\nAdditionally, our organizational documents contain provisions: authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock\u037e restricting persons who may call shareholder meetings\u037e providing for a classified Board\u037e permitting shareholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and only by super-majority vote\u037e and providing the Board with the exclusive right to fill vacancies and to fix the number of directors. These provisions of Florida law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could negatively affect our share price, prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management, prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or changes of control of the Company and discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 13878, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MDXG"}
