{"cik": "1163668", "company": "SOUTH PLAINS FINANCIAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you decide to invest, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this Report. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In that case, you could experience a partial or complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence generally. In addition, many state and local governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with the temporary closure of brick-and-mortar \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses, schools, and limitations on social gatherings, stay-at-home advisories and mandates, and travel bans and restrictions. Although many of these restrictions have eased or been lifted, these restrictions have resulted in significant adverse effects on our customers and business partners, particularly those in the retail, hospitality and food and beverage industries, among many others, including a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide, and in the regions and communities in which we operate. These measures may be implemented again in the event of another COVID-19 outbreak or any current or future variant thereof and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition, as well as the business, operations and financial conditions of our customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nOur borrowers have had, and may have again, difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19 could preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment of rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. We have actively worked to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although loans on deferral related to the COVID-19 pandemic at December 31, 2021 were only $15.9 million, we cannot predict whether any such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods.\nThe ultimate effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, including as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns, changes in consumer behavior, business closures, deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the Company (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented), declines in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans, branch or office closures and business interruptions.\nChanges in market interest rates or capital markets, including volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of Federal Reserve actions. Market interest rates declined significantly in 2020 and have remained at such levels over the past year. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income and margins and our profitability.\nGiven our business mix, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the financial markets. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, significantly affect financial institutions\u2019 net interest income. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than increases in the interest we receive on loans and investments, net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be affected. Earnings could also be affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19, and any current or future variant thereof, has also led to disruption and volatility in financial markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access financial markets, which may in turn affect the value of the subordinated notes. This market volatility could result in a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, which could result in goodwill impairment charges.\nUnpredictable future developments related to or resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our stock price, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Any future development is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios could be materially adversely affected and many of the risks described herein will be heightened.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, and the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and U.S. economy, is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the U.S. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent unprecedented cuts to the federal funds interest rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may further impact our ability to attract deposits, generate attractive earnings through our investment portfolio, and negatively affect the value of our loans and other assets. If and when monetary policy changes lead to an increase in interest rates, it may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as it could reduce the demand for loans and affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their indebtedness subjecting us to potential loan losses. Changes in any of these policies are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable.\nIn addition, the inflationary outlook in the United States remains uncertain. The consumer price index increased 7 percent year-over-year in December 2021. The risks to our business from inflation depends on the durability of the current inflationary pressures in our markets. Transitory increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material impact on our business or earnings. However, more persistent inflation could lead to tighter-than-expected monetary policy which could, in turn, increase the borrowings costs of our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations. High interest rates may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may grow through acquisitions, a strategy which may not be successful or, if successful, may produce risks in successfully integrating and managing the acquisitions and may dilute our shareholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial services companies within or outside our principal market areas. We regularly identify and explore specific acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices. However, we have no current arrangements, understandings, or agreements to make any material acquisitions. We face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources or more liquid securities than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business. Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future and that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate mergers, acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such merger, acquisition, or investment, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. We may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification by industry of our commercial loan portfolio, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of our loan portfolio, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers and the evaluation of our loan portfolio through our internal loan review process and other relevant factors.\nAccordingly, we maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s judgment of probable losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. There is no precise method of predicting loan losses, and therefore, we always face the risk that charge offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. The level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our management\u2019s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; industry concentrations; and other unidentified losses inherent in the Bank\u2019s current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, increases in our nonperforming loans, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Bank\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, we may further experience increased delinquencies, credit losses, and corresponding charges to capital, which could require us to increase our provision for loan losses associated with impacts related to the coronavirus outbreak due to quarantines, market downturns, increased unemployment rates, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, and related emergency response legislation, including the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Further, if real estate markets or the economy in general deteriorate, the Bank may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan-related losses. Additionally, banking regulators may require the Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses in the future, which could have a negative effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additions to the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow our assets.\nA new accounting standard will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may result in material increases to our allowance for loan losses.\nThe FASB has adopted a new accounting standard referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d). As we are an emerging growth company and take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act, CECL will be effective for the Company and the Bank for our first fiscal quarter after December 15, 2022. This standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. In anticipation of the adoption of CECL, we have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, significant additional expense to comply with the standard.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, loans to commercial borrowers represent approximately 71.4% of total loans. Loans to commercial borrowers are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. In general, these loans are collateralized by real estate and general business assets, including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and are typically backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. The collateral securing such may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. Accordingly, a downturn in the real estate market and economy could heighten our risk related to commercial loans, particularly commercial real estate loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loan may be impaired. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to additional credit risk with respect to loans that we make to other lenders.\nAs a part of our commercial lending activities, we may make loans to customers that, in turn, make commercial and residential real estate loans to other borrowers. When we make a loan of this nature, we take as collateral the promissory notes issued by the end borrowers to our customer, which are themselves secured by the underlying real estate. Because we are not lending directly to the end borrower, and because our collateral is a promissory note rather than the underlying real estate, we may be subject to risks that are different from those we are exposed to when it makes a loan directly that is secured by commercial or residential real estate. Because the ability of the end borrower to repay its loan from our customer could affect the ability of our customer to repay its loan from us, our inability to exercise control over the relationship with the end borrower and the collateral, except under limited circumstances, could expose us to credit losses that adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 69.4% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary component of collateral. Adverse developments affecting real estate values, particularly in our markets, could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to other mortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2021, our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled approximately 36.7% of our total loan portfolio. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur portfolio of indirect dealer lending exposes us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 9.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of indirect dealer loans, originated through automobile dealers for the purchase of new or used automobiles, as well as recreational vehicles, boats, and personal watercraft. We serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. Auto loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that may be difficult to locate and can depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted auto loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Auto loan collections depend on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business conditions, which may impair their ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business development and marketing strategies primarily result in us serving the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small- to medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact Texas, New Mexico or the specific markets in these states in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAgricultural lending and volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2021, agricultural loans were approximately 4.2% of our total loan portfolio. Agricultural lending involves a greater degree of risk and typically involves higher principal amounts than many other types of loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business, which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers. These factors include adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crops or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought, fires and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products (both domestically and internationally) and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies and environmental regulations). Volatility in commodity prices could adversely impact the ability of borrowers in these industries to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us, and as a result, a severe and prolonged decline in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations. It is also difficult to project future commodity prices as they are dependent upon many different factors beyond our control. In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. Consequently, agricultural loans may involve a greater degree of risk than other types of loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment (some of which is highly specialized with a limited or no market for resale), or assets such as livestock or crops. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted agricultural operating loan my not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation or because the assessed value of the collateral exceeds the eventual realization value.\nWe generate noninterest income through the sale of crop insurance products, and a termination of or substantial changes to the Federal crop insurance program would adversely impact our revenues from such business.\nThrough the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, the federal government subsidizes insurance companies by assuming an increasingly higher portion of losses incurred by farmers as a result of weather-related and other perils as well as commodity price fluctuations. The federal government also subsidizes the premium cost to farmers for multi-peril crop yield and revenue insurance. Without this risk assumption, losses incurred by insurers would be higher, increasing the premium on such insurance, and without the premium subsidy, the number of farmers purchasing multi-peril crop insurance would decline significantly. Periodically, members of the U.S. Congress propose to significantly reduce the government\u2019s involvement in the federal crop insurance program in an effort to reduce government spending. If legislation is adopted to reduce the amount of risk the government assumes, reduce the amount of insurance premium subsidies provided to farmers or otherwise change the coverage provided under multi-peril crop insurance policies, purchases of multi-peril crop insurance could experience a significant decline nationwide and in our market areas. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Bank had approximately $8.1 million in noninterest income attributable to sales of crop insurance.\nSustained volatility in oil prices and the energy industry, including in Texas, could lead to increased credit losses in our energy portfolio, weaker demand for energy lending, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough our energy loan portfolio is relatively small, the energy industry is a significant sector in our markets in Texas, and we intend to increase our energy lending. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, including sustained low oil prices or the failure of oil prices to rise in the future, could adversely affect our intention to increase our energy lending, and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to our direct exposure to energy loans, we also have indirect exposure to energy prices, as some of our non-energy customers\u2019 businesses are directly affected by volatility with the oil and gas industry and energy prices. While oil prices have increased in 2022, the oil and gas industry has remained volatile and prolonged volatility may cause further worsening conditions of energy industry and overall economic activities in the Company\u2019s primary markets and could lead to increased credit stress in its loan portfolio, increased losses and weaker demand for lending. More significantly for the Company, prolonged pricing pressure on oil and gas or general uncertainty resulting from energy price volatility could lead to increased credit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated with our energy portfolio, increased utilization of our contractual obligations to extend credit and weaker demand for energy lending. Such a decline or general uncertainty could have other adverse and unpredictable impacts, such as job losses in industries tied to energy, increased spending habits, lower borrowing needs, higher transaction deposit balances or a number of other effects that are difficult to isolate or quantify, particularly in states with significant dependence on the energy industry like Texas and New Mexico, all of which could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, affect the value of any collateral underlying our loans, and generally affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to our geographic concentration, specifically in Texas, we may be less able than other larger regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risk across multiple markets.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been discussions regarding potential changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could impact the prices of our customers\u2019 products, which could reduce demand for such products, reduce our customers\u2019 margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service their debt. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. However, a de minimis amount of collateral securing our loans is located outside of the U.S. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies have the potential to negatively impact our and/or our customers\u2019 costs, demand for our customers\u2019 products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks\u2019 risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount of nonperforming assets may increase and can take significant time and resources to resolve.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management, which may materially and adversely impact their ability to perform their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets.\nThe properties that we own and certain foreclosed real estate assets could subject us to environmental risks and associated costs.\nThere is a risk that hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants or other environmentally restricted substances could be discovered on our properties or our foreclosed assets (particularly with real estate loans). In this event, we might be required to remove the substances from the affected properties or to engage in abatement procedures at our cost. Besides being directly liable under certain federal and state statutes for our own conduct, we may also be held liable under certain circumstances for actions of borrowers or other third parties on property that secures our loans. Potential environmental liability could include the cost of remediation and also damages for any injuries caused to third parties. We cannot assure you that the cost of removal or abatement would not substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by those properties, that we would have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties or that we would be able to resell the affected properties either before or after completion of any such removal or abatement procedures. If material environmental problems are discovered before foreclosure, we generally will not foreclose on the related collateral or will transfer ownership of the loan to a subsidiary. It should be noted, however, that the transfer of the property or loans to a subsidiary may not protect us from environmental liability. Furthermore, despite these actions on our part, the value of the property as collateral will generally be substantially reduced and, as a result, we may suffer a loss upon collection of the loan. Currently, we are not, and the Company is not, a party to any pending legal proceeding under any environmental statute, nor are we aware of any instances that may give rise to such liability.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and we use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be imprecise and result in significant changes in valuation which could affect our, and thus the Company\u2019s, shareholders\u2019 equity.\nA portion of our assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, including investment securities. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or have third parties analyze our holdings and assign a market value. We rely on the analysis provided by our service providers. However, different valuations could be derived if our service providers used different financial models or assumptions.\nAs it relates to our investment securities portfolio, declines in the fair value of individual available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other-than-temporary would be included in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management of the Company considers (i) whether there is intent to sell securities prior to recovery and/or maturity; (ii) whether it is more likely than not that securities will have to be sold prior to recovery and/or maturity; and (iii) whether there is a credit loss component to the impairment.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. In addition, an economic downturn could result in losses, as determined under our accounting methodologies that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur largest loan relationships make up a material percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers As of December 31, 2021, our 20 largest borrowing relationships ranged from approximately $18.6 million to $51.0 million (including unfunded commitments) and totaled approximately 17.3% of our outstanding commitments. If any of these relationships become delinquent or suffer default, we could be exposed to material losses which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur largest deposit relationships currently make up a material percentage of our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits by our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.\nAt December 31, 2021, our 20 largest deposit relationships accounted for approximately 14.4% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related customer groups could force us to rely more heavily on other potentially more expensive and less stable sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. Additionally, such circumstances could require us to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Under applicable regulations, if the Bank were no longer \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d the Bank would not be able to accept brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the business of the Bank. Liquidity risk is the potential that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The Bank\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of the Bank\u2019s business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against the Bank. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting the Bank\u2019s ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.\nTechnology has made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. In addition, our level of deposits may be affected by lack of consumer confidence in financial institutions, which have caused fewer depositors to be willing to maintain deposits that are not fully insured by the FDIC. Depositors may withdraw certain deposits from the Bank and place them in other institutions or invest uninsured funds in investments perceived as being more secure, such as securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. In the current environment of low interest rates, our deposits may not be as stable or as interest rate insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past, and some existing or prospective deposit customers of banks generally, including the Bank, may be inclined to pursue other investment alternatives, which may negatively impact our net interest margin. Efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. As our assets grow, we may face increasing pressure to seek new deposits through expanded channels from new customers at favorable pricing, further increasing our costs.\nWe continually encounter technological changes which could result in us having fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively or timely implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and clients. Failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market interest rates could adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income.\nIn periods of increasing interest rates, loan originations may decline, and our borrowers may experience greater difficulties meeting their obligations, depending on the performance of the overall economy, which may adversely affect income from these lending activities. This could result in decreased interest income, decreased mortgage revenues and corresponding decreases in noninterest income from projected levels. During periods of reduced loan demand, results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we would be unable to reduce mortgage-related noninterest expenses commensurately with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity. Increases in interest rates could also adversely affect the market value of our fixed income assets. Conversely, in the current environment of decreasing interest rates and associated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economy, such as rising unemployment levels or changes in consumer behavior related to loans, loan originations may also decline, and our borrowers may experience difficulties meeting their obligations or seek to refinance their loans for lower rates, which may adversely affect income from these lending activities and negatively impact our net interest margin.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) previously announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31, 2021 and the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published after June 2023. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the alternative rate for use in derivatives and other financial contracts currently being indexed to LIBOR. SOFR is a daily index of the interest rate banks and hedge funds pay to borrow money overnight, secured by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool, and the future of LIBOR is still uncertain.\nIn October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny. In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost. At December 31, 2021, we had interest-rate swap contracts, other borrowings, and one loan indexed to LIBOR.\nDeposit outflows may increase reliance on borrowings and brokered deposits as sources of funds.\nWe have traditionally funded asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If, as a result of competitive pressures, market interest rates, alternative investment opportunities that present more attractive returns to customers, general economic conditions or other events, the balance of the Company\u2019s deposits decreases relative to the Company\u2019s overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale or other sources of external funding, or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future. Any such increased reliance on wholesale funding, or increases in funding rates in general, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s net interest income and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely impacted by an economic downturn or a natural disaster affecting one or more of our market areas.\nBecause most of our business activities are conducted in Texas and New Mexico and most of our credit exposure is there, we are at risk to adverse economic, political or business developments, including a downturn in real estate values, agricultural activities, the oil and gas industry and natural hazards such as floods, ice storms and tornadoes that affect Texas and New Mexico. Although our customers\u2019 business and financial interests may extend beyond these market areas, adverse conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay loans, affect the value of collateral underlying loans, impact our ability to attract deposits, and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we may be less able than other financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nMortgage originations have begun to decrease due to declines in refinance activity, and this trend may continue.\nMortgage revenues, which are primarily recognized from the sale in the secondary market of mortgage loans, are a source of noninterest income for the Bank and a contributor to the Bank\u2019s net income. Mortgage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $59.7 million. As the result of the low level of market interest rates that existed for the past several years, demand for loans to refinance existing mortgages remained strong through most of 2021. As market interest rates have increased from the prior low rate environment, there may be fewer opportunities for financial institutions to originate loans to refinance existing mortgages. If mortgage originations continue to decrease, projected mortgage revenues and noninterest income will decrease.\nMarket conditions could have a material impact on our ability to sell originated mortgages in the secondary market.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for those loans. These conditions may fluctuate or even worsen in the future. A reduction in our ability to sell mortgages that we originate on the secondary market would reduce our noninterest income from such sales and may increase our credit risk by causing us to retain mortgage loans that we would otherwise sell. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction in our mortgage origination volumes which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation from our mortgage operations.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nWe earn revenue from fees we receive for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a growing portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. A mortgage servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan-collect principal, interest, and escrow amounts-for a fee. We acquire mortgage servicing rights when we keep the servicing rights in connection with the sale of loans we have originated.\nChanges in interest rates may impact our mortgage servicing revenues, which could negatively impact our noninterest income. When rates rise, net revenue from our mortgage servicing activities can increase due to slower prepayments. When rates fall, the value of our mortgage servicing rights usually tends to decline as a result of a higher volume of prepayments, resulting in a decline in our net revenue. It is possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the mortgage servicing rights value caused by the lower rates. Because the value of our mortgage servicing rights is capitalized on our balance sheet and evaluated on a quarterly basis, any significant decline in value could adversely affect our income, our capital ratios or require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms. We had $19.7 million of mortgage servicing rights as of December 31, 2021.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework consists of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risks to which we are subject, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, reputation, business and compliance risks. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling in our management\u2019s decision-making and faulty data or modeling approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or possibly subject us to regulatory scrutiny in the future.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is endemic to bank decision-making, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. We currently utilize stress testing for capital, credit and liquidity purposes and anticipate that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future.\nWe anticipate data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely and in differing applications. While we believe these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or result in adverse regulatory scrutiny. Secondarily, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making. We seek to mitigate this risk by increasingly performing back-testing to analyze the accuracy of these techniques and approaches.\nThere are investment performance, fiduciary and asset servicing risks associated with our trust operations.\nOur investment management, fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to the business of the Company. Generating returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction. Failure to do so can generate liability, as can failure to manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities or the failure to manage these risks adequately, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or future prospects.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risks associated with our internet-based systems and online commerce security.\nThird party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our customer information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our customer confidential information at risk. Although we have not experienced a cyber-incident which has compromised our data or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. We monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of cyber threats.\nA breach in the security of any of our information systems, or other cyber incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain customers and business reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection or related to remediation. Furthermore, our customers could terminate their accounts with us because of a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party, which is outside of our control. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive certain third-party services including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operating risks related to employee error and customer, employee and third party misconduct, which could harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error or employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee error or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. Our necessary dependence upon processing systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Employee error or misconduct could also subject us to financial claims. If our internal control systems fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured, exceeds applicable insurance limits or if insurance coverage is denied or not available, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by our ability to retain the services of existing senior management and, as we expand, to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management. Our senior executive officers have had, and will continue to have, a significant role in the development and management of our business. The loss of services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Accordingly, should we lose the services of any of the executive officers, our Board may have to search outside of the Bank for a qualified permanent replacement. This search may be prolonged and we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and hire a qualified replacement. If any of our executive officers leave their respective positions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may suffer. We also depend upon the experience of the other officers of the Bank, the managers of our banking facilities and on their relationships with the communities they serve. We may not be able to retain our current personnel or attract additional qualified key persons as needed.\nOur ability to develop, retain and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur ability to retain and grow our loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of our bankers, many of whom we develop internally. If we lose the services of any of our bankers, including successful bankers employed by financial institutions that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, or fail to successfully recruit bankers or develop bankers internally, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy, retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether a new banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to develop, attract or retain successful bankers, or if our bankers fail to meet our expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nCompetition from other financial intermediaries may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S. banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. We will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations. A number of institutions with which we compete have significantly greater assets, capital and other resources. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. Also, many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect competition to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative banking sources. Furthermore, our legal lending limit is significantly less than the limits for many of our competitors, and this may hinder our ability to establish relationships with larger businesses in our primary service area. This competition may limit our future growth and earnings prospects.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to our failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise. Moreover, even if our management concludes that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may not conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the \u201cFDICIA\u201d) for compliance with the requirement of FDICIA. Any such deficiencies may also subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the FDICIA, and we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nWe expect to incur significant incremental costs related to operating as a public company, particularly when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) and NASDAQ, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations. We expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur equity compensation plan will cause dilution and increase our costs, which will reduce our income.\nOur equity compensation plan allows us to award shares of our common stock (at no cost to the participant), award options to purchase shares of our common stock, and award other equity-based compensation. Additionally, on an annual basis and without shareholder approval, the number of approved shares available for issuance under the equity compensation plan increases by 3% of our total issued and outstanding shares as of the beginning of that fiscal year unless our Board exercises its discretion to limit such an increase. Issuance of awards under our equity compensation plan is a risk factor our shareholders in at least two ways. First, issuances of our common stock and exercise of equity-based awards underlying our common stock causes dilution of shareholders\u2019 ownership interests which, in the aggregate, may be significant. Second, issuances of our common stock and other equity-based awards are expensed by us over their vesting period at the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded. Accordingly, grants made under the equity compensation plan will increase our costs, which will reduce our net income.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and adversely affect our results of operations. Although we take steps to minimize reputational risk in dealing with our customers and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business. In addition, companies are facing increased scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. In addition, new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Increased ESG-related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, we participate in loans originated by other institutions, and we participate in syndicated transactions (including shared national credits) in which other lenders serve as the lead bank. As a result, defaults by, declines in the financial condition of, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, financial service companies or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity, asset quality or other problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These problems, losses or defaults could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUntil May 31, 2018, our Company was an S Corporation, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.\u2009\nUntil May 31, 2018, our Company was an S Corporation. Effective May 31, 2018, the Company revoked its S Corporation election and the Company became taxed as a C Corporation under the provisions of Sections 301 to 385 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (which treat the corporation as an entity that is subject to an entity level U.S. federal income tax). If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the IRS, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we likely would be obligated to pay corporate level tax, plus interest and possible penalties, with respect to those open tax years. This could result in tax liability with respect to all of the income we reported for periods when we believed we properly were treated as an S Corporation not subject to entity level taxation. Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or failure to comply with them, could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF and the overall financial stability of the banking system in the United States. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, subject us to additional restrictions, oversight and reporting obligations, which have significantly increased costs. And over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on enhanced risk management practices, mortgage law and regulation, compliance with the BSA and AML laws, data integrity and security, use of service providers, and fair lending and other consumer protection issues, which has increased our need to build additional processes and infrastructure. Government agencies charged with adopting and interpreting laws and regulations may do so in an unforeseen manner, including in ways that potentially expand the reach of the laws or regulations more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts our operations and capital requirements.\nThe federal bank regulators have issued final guidance regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending directed at institutions that have concentrations of ADC loans and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans within their lending portfolios. In general, the guidance establishes the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible concentration risk: (1) the institution\u2019s total ADC loans represent 100% or more of total capital; or (2) total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of total capital, and such loans have increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. This guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed these guidelines should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Our ADC loans comprise 74.7% of the Bank\u2019s capital, and our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans comprise 207.1% of the Bank\u2019s capital. Although we are below the concentrations set forth in the guidance, we cannot guarantee that any risk management practices we implement will be effective to prevent losses relating to our commercial real estate portfolio. Management has implemented controls to monitor the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending concentrations, but we cannot predict the extent to which this guidance will impact our operations or capital requirements.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, including laws applicable to the financial industry and federal and state taxation, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business, financial condition and results of operations, may not occur on the timeframe that is proposed, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nGenerally, we must receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell banking locations as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. In addition, as opportunities arise, we may continue de novo branching as a part of our expansion strategy. De novo branching and acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo banking locations could impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Accordingly, a capital injection may be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress. Such capital injection may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital to make the required capital injection. Any borrowing by the Company in order to make the required capital injection may be more difficult and expensive and may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and/or future prospects.\nAs a regulated entity, we and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our and the Bank\u2019s operations and potential growth.\nWe and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, respectively. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d Many factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments, impairment losses on securities and other factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios. Our failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, either under the existing capital requirements or under the CBLR framework, if applicable, could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company, the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under regulatory rules, if we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and our ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted.\nBank regulatory agencies periodically examine our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur regulators periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were, or our management was, in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties against us, our officers or directors, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain sufficient capital under regulatory requirements, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, that failure could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance.\nWe must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed to support the Bank, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor preferences regarding the banking industry and market condition and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious reputational consequences for us.\nThe BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act, the National Defense Authorization Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal bank regulators, as well as the DOJ, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the U.S. are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face increased risk under the terms of the CRA, as we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets.\nUnder the terms of the CRA, each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank\u2019s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory agency rates such bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA as \u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d The regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of the institution\u2019s record is part of the regulatory agency\u2019s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office. As we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets, we will be required to maintain an acceptable CRA rating. Maintaining an acceptable CRA rating may become more difficult as our deposits increase across new geographic markets.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the ECOA, and the FHA, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The DOJ, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if our consumer facing operations do not operate in compliance with applicable regulations.\nWhile all aspects of our operations are subject to detailed and complex compliance regimes, those portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers pose particular challenges given the emphasis on consumer compliance by bank regulators at all levels. Residential mortgage lending raises significant compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage lending regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent operating environment in which mortgage lending officers operate. In addition, some regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance, even if noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional. As a result, despite the education, compliance training, supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if noncompliance is inadvertent or unintentional, could result in the Bank being strictly liable for restitution or damages to individual borrowers and could expose the Bank to other regulatory enforcement activity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active public trading market may not be sustained.\nWe completed the initial public offering, and the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, in May 2019. An active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained. If an active trading market is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling your shares of our common stock at an attractive price, or at all. Consequently, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above an attractive price at the time that you would like to sell.\nThe market price of our common stock could be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline, result in losses to our shareholders and litigation against us.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits. Despite unsuccessful, as in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our normal business, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nFuture equity issuances, including through our current or any future equity compensation plans, could result in dilution, which could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. We may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing additional shares of our common stock. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into shares of our common stock, for any reason, the issuance could have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nAlthough there are currently no shares of our preferred stock outstanding, our certificate of formation authorizes us to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The Board has the power to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, preferences over our voting common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur directors and executive officers have significant control over our business.\nDue to the significant ownership interests of our directors and executive officers, our directors and executive officers are able to significantly affect our management, affairs and policies. For example, our directors and executive officers may be able to influence the outcome of the election of directors and the potential outcome of other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, such as mergers, the sale of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary corporate matters. In addition, pursuant to a separate Board Representation Agreement, dated March 7, 2019, between the Company and James C. Henry, for so long as Mr. Henry or his spouse, or a lineal descendant of the Henry\u2019s, or an entity formed for their benefit, holds in aggregate 5.0% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, the Company must nominate their representative to serve on the Board of each of the Company and the Bank, subject to any required regulatory and shareholder approvals. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d for additional information.\nOur bylaws have an exclusive forum provision, which could limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws have an exclusive forum provision providing that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Lubbock Division, or in the event that such court lacks jurisdiction to hear the action, the District Courts of the County of Lubbock, Texas, are the sole and exclusive forum for certain causes of action, which may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common shareholders. The Federal Reserve has also issued guidance requiring that we inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to our capital structure, including interest on any debt obligations. Finally, if required payments on our debt obligations are not made, or dividends on any preferred stock we may issue are not paid, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other than issuances of securities, is distributions from the Bank.\nOur principal source of funds to pay distributions on our common stock and service any of our obligations, other than further issuances of securities, would be dividends received from the Bank. Furthermore, the Bank is not obligated to pay dividends to us, and any dividends paid to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of the Bank and various business and regulatory considerations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we have taken advantage of certain reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years after the date of our initial public offering, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. As a result, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 18671, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SPFI"}
