We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in this annual report or our other public statements. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may have similar adverse effects on us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses in every reporting period since we commenced business operations in 2010 and expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss applicable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $7,488,172 and $7,009,414, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was $40,593,180. There is no assurance that any revenues we generate will be sufficient for us to become profitable or to maintain profitability. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1,651,765 and $807,488, respectively, and our operating expenses for those periods were $9,571,185 and $5,914,299, respectively. Our current revenues are not sufficient to fund our operations. We cannot predict when, if ever, we might achieve profitability and we are not certain that we will be able to sustain profitability, if achieved. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, the market price of our securities is likely to be adversely affected.\nWe will require additional financing to continue our operations, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $11,447,047. We will need to raise additional financings to fund our operations, maintain compliance with the NASDAQ listing requirements and implement our business plan. There is no assurance as to the amount and availability of any required future financing or the terms thereof. Such financing, if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may otherwise include onerous terms. If in the form of debt, such financing may include covenants and repayment obligations which may be difficult to meet and that could adversely affect our business operations. To the extent that funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our business operations and may lose our NASDAQ listing.\nOur operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nWe are continuing to develop our technologies and to implement our business plan. Our ability to implement a successful business plan remains unproven, and there is no assurance that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. Our operating history, together with the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business in connection with making a decision about whether to invest in our securities.\nWe face the risks normally associated with a new business.\nWe face all of the risks inherent in a new business, including the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with conducting new operations and efforts to develop and commercialize technologies. These uncertainties include developing our technologies and our brand name, raising capital to meet our working capital requirements and developing a customer base, among others. If we are not effective in addressing these risks, we will not be able to operate profitably in the future, and we may not have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a global economic downturn.\nAny economic downturn generally could cause a drop in government spending and business investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, as a result of the current global economic and geopolitical situation, there may be a disruption or delay in performance by our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur significant damages if we are unable to adequately discharge our contractual obligations.\nOur failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our clients\u2019 performance expectations on a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. This, in turn, would impact our ability to compete for new clients and contracts. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages under the terms of such contracts. In addition, some of our contracts require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards and/or contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures. Although we do have liability insurance, the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all such potential liabilities.\nSome of our clients may terminate our contracts prior to completion, which could result in revenue shortfalls and reduce profitability or cause losses on contracts.\nSome of our contracts with clients contain initial or base periods of one or more years, as well as option periods typically covering more than one-half of the contract\u2019s initial duration. However, such clients are under no obligation to exercise the option to extend the contract term. The profitability of some of our contracts could be adversely impacted if such options are not exercised and the contract term is not extended accordingly. Additionally, our contracts contain provisions permitting a client to terminate the contract on short notice, with or without cause. The unexpected termination of significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a client might terminate its contracts with us.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, which would negatively impact our operations.\nWe have operated our current line of business for approximately eleven years, and we expect to grow in the near future as our business develops and becomes further established. If our business grows as we anticipate, it will be necessary for us to manage our expansion in an orderly fashion. Any significant growth in our activities or in the market for our services will require extension of our managerial, operational, marketing and other resources. Future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. Additionally, if our growth comes at the expense of providing quality service and generating reasonable profits, our ability to successfully bid for contracts and our profitability will be adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth we may experience.\nFailure to obtain adequate insurance coverage could put us at risk for uninsured losses.\nSome or all of our customers may require insurance as a requirement to conduct business with us. Although we currently have product liability insurance, we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential losses. Additionally, there are certain types of losses that may not be insurable at a cost that we can afford, and insurance may not be available at any cost with respect to certain losses. Claims or losses in excess of any insurance coverage we may obtain, or the lack of insurance coverage, could put us at risk of loss for any uninsured loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on key personnel, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe depend on key scientific and other personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. In addition, our delivery of services will be labor-intensive: when we are awarded a contract, we may need to quickly hire project leaders and project management personnel. The additional staff may also create a concurrent demand for increased administrative personnel. The success of our business will require that we attract, develop, motivate and retain:\n\u25cf experienced and innovative executive officers;\n\u25cf senior managers who have successfully managed or designed programs in the public sector; and\n\u25cf information technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects.\nInnovative, experienced and technically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain desirable executive officers, senior managers, and technology professionals. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of executive officers and senior managers could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be dependent on cash flow and payments from customers in order to meet our expense obligations.\nA number of factors may cause our revenues, cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter, including the following:\n\u25cf the progression of contracts;\n\u25cf the rate of customer adoption of our new subscription pricing program;\n\u25cf the commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u25cf the schedules of government agencies and large multinational corporations for awarding contracts;\n\u25cf the failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations under contracts with us; and\n\u25cf the term of awarded contracts and potential acquisitions.\nChanges in the volume of activity and the number of contracts commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations because a significant portion of our expenses are fixed. Fixed expenses include, rent, payroll, insurance, employee benefits, taxes and other administrative costs and overhead. Moreover, we expect to incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and typically do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter.\nWe may make acquisitions in the future that we are unable to effectively manage given our limited resources.\nWe may choose to grow our business by acquiring other entities. We may be unable to manage businesses that we have acquired or to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, business combinations involve additional risks, including:\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf our becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u25cf assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities;\n\u25cf unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities;\n\u25cf amortization of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill; and\n\u25cf dilution to existing stockholders and our earnings per share.\nAlso, client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole. Further, the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings that we anticipated.\nWe may be unable to develop or commercialize new and rapidly evolving technologies.\nMany of our activities involve developing products or processes that are based upon new, rapidly evolving technologies. The ability to commercialize or further develop these technologies could fail for a variety of reasons, both within and outside of our control.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success in part depends on the ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. To do so, we will be required to prosecute patent applications and maintain patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection. There can be no assurance that our program for protection of intellectual property and proprietary technology will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology from competitors. Our business is also subject to the risk that our issued patents will not provide us with significant competitive advantages if, for example, a competitor was to independently develop or obtain similar or superior technologies. In addition, our issued patents may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties. The enforcement of intellectual property rights is subject to considerable uncertainty and can be expensive and time-consuming. Patent reform laws and court decisions interpreting such laws, may create additional uncertainty around our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business; however, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information.\nWe may be sued by third parties who claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our research, development and commercialization activities infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties to which we do not hold licenses or other rights, or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial and human resources. In addition, if successful, such claims could cause us to pay substantial damages. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nOur bylaws contain provisions indemnifying our officers and directors against all costs, charges, and expenses incurred by them.\nOur bylaws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of being or having been one of our directors or officers. To the extent that our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policy does not provide reimbursement for such costs, charges, expenses and other amounts, we may incur substantial expenses in satisfying our indemnification obligations.\nOur operating costs could be significantly higher than we expect, and this could reduce our future profitability.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, market fluctuations and international risks, significant increases in operating, development and implementation costs could adversely affect us due to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nBusinesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Although to-date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put in place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. Additionally, the coronavirus may result in disruption of financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our securities is subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nBetween January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $1.77 to a high of $7.64 and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed previously in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and others, such as:\n\u25cf delays or failures in the commercialization of our current or future products and services;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our products or services;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products and services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u25cf adverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf commencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf any major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf market conditions in our industry; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our securities.\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nAny sudden decline in the market price of our securities could trigger securities class action lawsuits against us. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our market price of our securities.\nHistorically, there has been a limited trading market in our common stock, and you may therefore have difficulty selling your securities at a price that you determine is satisfactory.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Historically, there has been a limited trading market for our common stock. There is no assurance that our common stock will actively trade in the public market at or above a price that you consider acceptable. If an active market for our common stock is not maintained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock when you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider satisfactory. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling securities and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our securities as consideration.\nThere is no assurance that we will satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. For example, there is no assurance that our common stock will continue to have a bid price of at least $1.00 per share, which is the minimum bid price under such continued listing requirements, or that we will be able to satisfy other quantitative continued listing requirements, including the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement of at least $2,500,000 for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which we have previously failed to satisfy. If we fail to satisfy a Nasdaq requirement for continued listing, Nasdaq could provide notice that our common stock will become subject to delisting. In such event, Nasdaq rules would permit us to appeal the decision to reject our proposed compliance plan or any delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. If our securities are de-listed from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our stockholders could incur material adverse consequences such as reduced liquidity for their securities and reduced market prices for their securities. Following such de-listing, we could encounter increased difficulty in issuing additional securities at an attractive price, or at all, in order to fund our operations.\nYou may experience additional dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be lower than the price per share that you paid for our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our securities offerings and may not use them effectively.\nWe intend to use our cash for the development of our products and services. Our management has broad discretion in the use of cash and will have the right to use our cash in ways that differ substantially from our current plans. Management may spend our cash in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our securities. The failure by management to apply funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and cause the market price of our securities to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our securities.\nWe currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that our securities will appreciate in price.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our securities, the market price of our securities and their trading volume could decline.\nIf we do not obtain and maintain research coverage by securities and industry analysts, the market price for our securities may be adversely affected. The market price of our securities also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our performance. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the market price of our securities and their trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had 10,498,802 outstanding shares of common stock. Future sales of a large number of our shares or upon exercise of our outstanding warrants and stock options, or the perception that a large number of shares may be sold, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe will incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. and Nasdaq reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with applicable U.S. and Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. These applicable rules and regulations also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the market price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish such internal control, or any failure of such internal control once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting (including those weaknesses identified in our periodic reports), or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our securities.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders or be used to deter a possible acquisition of our company;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n\u25cf the ability of our directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which would dilute the interest of or impair the voting power of our common stockholders.\nThese provisions could inhibit or prevent possible transactions that some stockholders may consider attractive.\nWe could issue one or more additional series of shares of preferred stock with the effect of diluting existing stockholders and impairing their voting and other rights.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion, and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. As of December 31, 2021, 465 shares of our preferred stock are outstanding, consisting of 132 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and 333 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. In addition to the possible negative effect on the market price of our common shares resulting from the public sale or perceived sale of common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise of these securities, the Certificate of Designations for the Series D Preferred Stock provides that upon occurrence of certain triggering events described in the Certificate, including but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of the transaction documents pertaining to the Series D Preferred Stock and failure to maintain listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the Series D Preferred Shares would become subject to redemption, at the option of the holder, at a 125% premium to the underlying value of the Series D Shares being redeemed.", "PERMNO": 16594, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "SGLB"}
