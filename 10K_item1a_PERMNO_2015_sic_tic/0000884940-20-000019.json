{"cik": "884940", "company": "STEIN MART INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks and uncertainties. In evaluating us, the risks and uncertainties described below and the matters described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d should be considered carefully. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, liquidity, ability to continue as a going concern and future prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the material adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our supply chain partners, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, and our stores. In March 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all stores for an unknown period of time and significant actions taken to mitigate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows to protect our business and associates for the long-term in response to the crisis. Such actions include targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses such as advertising and payroll expenses, including furloughing a significant number of our employees and temporarily reducing the payroll of remaining employees, reducing capital expenditures, reducing merchandise receipts, and utilizing funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note. Further, we have sought and are seeking extended payment terms with all vendors, including merchandise, expense and rent vendors. We are unable to predict when our sales will reach pre-pandemic levels or if additional periods of store closures will be needed or mandated. In addition, our merchandise vendors may have been negatively impacted by the financial difficulties of other retailers, thereby creating concerns about vendors' ability to provide us with payment terms or merchandise that is suitable to our brand. Continued impacts of the pandemic have materially adversely impacted our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, and has required significant actions as mentioned above. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Continued impacts of the pandemic have had a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations during fiscal year 2020 and raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and a continuation of negative financial trends would likely result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and liquidity as described above, our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although disclosing that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in our financial statements is considered to be an Event of Default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" below.\nIf our operating results fail to improve, we could violate additional debt covenants and our liquidity would be further adversely impacted and we would need to secure additional sources of funding. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our borrowing base availability under our Credit Agreement and/or Term Loan, raise additional capital to fund our operations, or that debt or equity financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms or at all. If our operating results fail to improve, then our financial condition and lack of liquidity would render us unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur sales and operating results are affected by consumer sensitivity to economic conditions and world events.\nThe retail apparel business is dependent upon consumer spending and, as a fashion retailer, we rely on the expenditure of discretionary income for most, if not all, of our sales. Economic factors affecting consumer confidence and levels of consumer spending include levels of employment, the housing market, the stock market, prevailing interest rates, tax policies, personal bankruptcies, energy costs and availability and cost of credit. Consumer confidence is also affected by both domestic and international events. In addition, widespread health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest, could cause a loss of store traffic or otherwise cause consumers to cease making discretionary purchases or otherwise change consumer behaviors. Deterioration in the level of consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the retail industry.\nWe face intense competition for customers from department stores, specialty stores, regional and national off-price retail chains and internet and mail-order retailers. Many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many department stores and other competitors have become more promotional and have reduced their price points. Certain department stores and certain of our vendors have opened outlet stores that offer merchandise at prices that are competitive with ours. If we fail to successfully compete, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMany of our competitors have significant Ecommerce sales. While we maintain an internet site, our omnichannel sales comprised approximately 6.0 percent of our total sales in 2019. One of our strategic priorities is to further develop our omnichannel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and Ecommerce shopping channels. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omnichannel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omnichannel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected.\nUnanticipated changes in fashion trends and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our sales.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner. Although we attempt to stay abreast of the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand, fashion trends can change rapidly and we may not accurately anticipate shifts in fashion trends and adjust our merchandise mix to appeal to changing consumer tastes in a timely manner. If we misjudge the market for our products or are unsuccessful in responding to changes in fashion trends or in market demand, we could experience insufficient inventory levels and missed opportunities, or excess inventory levels and higher markdowns, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may also lose customers and market share to those of our competitors who are able to better anticipate, identify and respond to such fashion trends and market demands. Because our success depends on our brand image, our business could be materially adversely affected if new product offerings are not accepted by our customers to the same extent as past product offerings.\nWe are dependent on our key vendors and factors for credit to acquire merchandise.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to purchase merchandise at competitive terms through relationships with our vendors and their factors, as applicable. A significant change in vendor and factor support could limit our ability to acquire desired merchandise at competitive prices or payment terms. In addition, to the extent our vendors or factors are unable to operate or are otherwise negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to acquire the merchandise we desire. If we continue to experience declining operating performance or liquidity challenges, vendors and their factors may seek protection against non-payment, such as accelerated payment terms or letters of credit. In addition, our merchandise vendors may have been negatively impacted by the financial difficulties of other retailers, thereby creating concerns about vendors' ability to provide us with payment terms. These factors could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, profitability and results of operations.\nOur ability to sustain profitable growth is subject to our successfully implementing strategic plans.\nThe success of our strategic plans is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management and other associates and our success with third parties. The loss of key management personnel could also negatively affect the execution of our business strategy. Additional changes may be required if we are unable to successfully implement our plans or if we adopt new strategies for the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives or that the implementation of changes will result in the benefits or costs savings at the levels that we anticipate or at all, which may result in an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional strategies may be ineffective.\nOur profitability and results of operations may be materially affected by the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select the right markets and media in which to advertise. In particular, we may not be successful in our efforts to create greater awareness of our stores and promotions, identify the most effective and efficient level of spending and specific media vehicle to use in each market or determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for our advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures. Our competitors\u2019 marketing efforts may be more effective than ours. Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenues. Further, we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms.\nIf our existing cash, cash generated from operations, proceeds from our term loan, funds available under our revolving credit agreement and deferred payments to landlords and vendors were insufficient to fund our future operations, including capital expenditures, or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. We may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms or on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms when required could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to negotiate acceptable lease terms or concessions with current and potential landlords.\nAs of June 10, 2020, we have negotiated amendments for approximately 220 of our properties to amend our lease terms to defer a portion of the rent or other expenses due during the time period that our properties were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are actively negotiating with the majority of our other landlords. There is no assurance that we will be able to re-negotiate lease concessions or deferrals. There is also no assurance that we will be able to negotiate satisfactory terms on new or replacement stores, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nUnderperforming stores can result in charges and expenses.\nIf individual stores underperform to the point that their future estimated cash flows will not cover our un-depreciated fixed asset investment, we record an impairment charge. We also close certain underperforming stores, generally based on the lack of store profitability. Such closures subject us to costs, including lease termination payments and the write-down of leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, fixtures and inventory. For early terminations, we may incur charges for asset write-downs and remain liable for future lease obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nBecause of our focus on keeping our inventory at the forefront of fashion trends, extreme and/or unseasonable weather conditions could force us to have higher inventory markdowns or result in lost revenue.\nOur business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the fall season or cool weather during the spring season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nExtreme weather can also disrupt our operations and result in store closures, loss of inventory and property damage. Certain regions of the country where our stores are located, such as California and the southeastern United States, experience extreme weather patterns such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and flooding. While we maintain insurance that allows us to recover some losses from extreme weather events, extreme weather may have a negative effect on our profitability and results of operations. Our business is seasonal with our highest sales occurring in the first and fourth quarters, which include the spring and holiday seasons. Our annual operating results depend significantly upon sales generated during these quarters, and any factor that negatively affects these selling seasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year.\nA lack of adequate sources of merchandise at acceptable prices may adversely affect our sales.\nOur business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to purchase fashion and brand-name merchandise and to do so at acceptable wholesale prices. We continuously seek out buying opportunities and compete for these opportunities with other retailers. In the event of a further decrease in retail sales and the resulting pressure on manufacturers, the opportunities to purchase merchandise could become limited by the consolidation or demise of merchandise vendors. Our ability to obtain merchandise also depends on manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain vendor financing through banks and factoring companies, which may be negatively impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent they are unable to secure sufficient credit, they may not be able to sell to us at acceptable terms. Although we do not depend on any single vendor or group of vendors and believe we can successfully compete in seeking out new vendors, the loss of key vendors could make it difficult for us to acquire sufficient quantities and an appropriate mix of merchandise, and to do so at acceptable prices could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. In addition, many of our vendors have been negatively impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause a further strain on our ability to secure merchandise.\nIncreases in the price of merchandise could increase our costs, which could negatively affect our margins.\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our goods are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, supply conditions, government regulations, trade restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and other unpredictable factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Our procurement of goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases, which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. Additionally, procurement of our merchandise is subject to increases in demand for, or the price of, raw materials, services and labor. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and increases in the cost of employee compensation and benefits could affect our financial results and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on attracting and retaining quality employees. Many of our employees are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover; at times, we must find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers. We also face challenges in recruiting and retaining talent in other areas, including management, merchandising and information technology for reasons such as talent availability in our geographic areas and otherwise. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs, including hourly wages and costs of providing retirement, health and other employee benefits, and hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, including health care legislation. Departures of key personnel could be viewed in a negative light by investors or analysts, which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock. We are also unsure of the impact on our employee base as a result of the recent furloughs and salary reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the increased costs associated with hiring and training new employees could affect our results of operations.\nIf we experience any business interruptions or disruptions in the distribution process, our profitability could be materially affected.\nWe may not anticipate, respond adequately to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution operations. In the event that orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise is disrupted by labor disputes at ports of entry, a health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest or other factors beyond our control, impeding the timeliness or fulfillment quality of the products being distributed, or any of our distribution centers becomes inaccessible, or is otherwise not fully usable, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries.\nMuch of the fashion and brand-name merchandise we acquire through vendors is sourced from various foreign countries. Political or financial instability, terrorism, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, raw material shortages, disruptions, strikes, work stoppages, health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability of our merchandise inventory. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which the current COVID-19 pandemic will have on our vendors. Current discussions regarding increases in tariffs or reductions in deductibility for merchandise sourced from foreign vendors could materially affect our inventory costs, and if we are unable to pass those increases on to our customers, the increases could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, customer satisfaction and results of operations. Additionally, we require our vendors and the third parties from whom they source merchandise to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and our own sourcing policies such as the use of labor practices that are considered ethical in the United States and not using fur in our merchandise. We do not have the ability to control our vendors, their manufacturers or their employment and business practices. The failure of our vendors and their suppliers to comply with applicable laws and our policies could affect the availability and price of merchandise, damage our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nFailure of information technology could disrupt operations and harm our business.\nThe operation of our business and the effective execution of our merchandising and distribution strategies as well as our financial reporting and online selling processes are dependent in large measure on the effectiveness of our information technology systems as well as those of external service providers. The reliability and capacity of these technology systems are critical and any disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by unfavorable results of legal proceedings.\nWe are continually involved in various unresolved legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business involving matters such as pricing and wage and hour matters. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal proceedings or claims, either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable outcome could result and that some of these matters could be material to our profitability and results of operations for any particular period.\nWe are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.\nOur business and that of our third-party service providers employ systems and websites that allow us to process credit card transactions containing personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), perform online Ecommerce and social media activities and store and transmit proprietary or confidential customer, employee, job applicant and other personal confidential information. Security and/or privacy breaches, acts of vandalism or terror, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming, and/or human error or other similar events expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability.\nWe may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks or intrusions. We rely heavily on outside suppliers and service providers for our Ecommerce and online credit card transactions, and this reliance exposes us to breaches through cyber-attacks on third-party systems we utilize for our business. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, our third-party service providers, our vendors, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant and additional costs, including, but not limited to the costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, engage third-party experts and consultants and comply with various applicable laws or industry standards regarding use and/or unauthorized disclosure of PII. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our customers as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. We also have obtained insurance coverage for cyber-security breaches to assist in covering costs incurred in the event of a significant breach. While we have implemented measures reasonably designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our systems or our third-party service providers\u2019 systems are subject to privacy and security incidents, including attacks by unauthorized users, corruption by computer viruses or other malicious software code, emerging cybersecurity risks, inadvertent or intentional release of confidential or proprietary information, or other similar events. A significant data security incident would cause us to incur significant reputational harm and remediation costs, including liability for stolen customer, job applicant or employee information, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring and/or other benefits to affected customers, job applicants or employees. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by us to protect transaction or other data. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including a breach of us or of our third-party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. The legal and regulatory environment regarding PII, data security and privacy is increasingly complex at both the federal and state level, with heightened public awareness and scrutiny. Compliance with new data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs, limit our ability to obtain and utilize PII of our customers in our business and expose us to litigation and regulatory risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe rely on a single supplier of shoes sold by our shoe department and disruptions with that supplier could materially affect our reputation, operations and financial results.\nWe have an agreement with DSW to be the exclusive supplier of shoes sold in our shoe departments. We rely on DSW to determine the quantity and mix of shoes to be sold, the prices at which such items are to be sold and the fulfillment and continuing supply of inventory. If DSW is unable to provide us with sufficient amounts of inventory or inventory that meets the fashion preferences of our customers or if DSW is unable to continue being our supplier of shoes, we may attract fewer customers and experience a loss in net sales, which could materially affect our reputation, profitability and results of operations.\nReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and our inability to meet financial covenants with our third-party provider could adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.\nOur co-branded and private label credit cards under the Stein Mart brand are issued by a third party, Synchrony Bank (\u201cSynchrony\u201d). Synchrony extends credit directly to card holders, provides all servicing for the credit card accounts and bears all risk of credit and fraud losses. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow we received from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the percentage of sales on private label and co-branded accounts relative to the Company\u2019s total sales, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony\u2019s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking and consumer protection laws, which could also materially limit the availability of credit to consumers or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders. Due to these factors, the income and cash flows we receive from our credit card program with Synchrony could decrease significantly, and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. Additionally, we are subject to certain financial covenants as part of our agreement with Synchrony and if we fail to satisfy such covenants, we could be subject to a reserve, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows.\nWe utilize the services of two third-party service providers to operate and maintain our Ecommerce website and to provide order management, customer service and fulfillment support. Disruptions with these providers or in the services they provide to us could adversely affect our reputation, operations and financial results.\nWe have contracted with a third-party service provider to operate and host our Ecommerce website. We have contracted with a second third-party service provider to provide order management, customer service, payment, fraud and fulfillment services. We rely on the operational, privacy and security procedures and controls of these two providers to host and operate our Ecommerce business. Failure of either of these providers to adequately service these aspects of our Ecommerce business could result in prolonged disruption, which affects our customers\u2019 ability to utilize our website or receive the product in a timely manner. As a result, we may lose customer sales and/or experience increased costs, which could affect our reputation, operations and financial results. In addition, the Ecommerce operations also involve other risks, which could influence our results of operations including but not limited to diversion of sales from our physical stores, liability for online content, credit card fraud and risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and related support systems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nActs or threats of terrorism, health crisis, violence or unfavorable or uncertain political conditions could harm our business.\nActs of terrorism or war, health crisis, political or civil unrest and uncertainty, pandemics, and other catastrophes may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively affect our sales by causing consumer spending to decline. Also, an act of terrorism or war, or the threat thereof, political or civil unrest or uncertainty, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other catastrophes, could negatively affect our business by interfering with our ability to obtain suitable merchandise from vendors. Inability to obtain suitable merchandise from our vendors or substitute suppliers at similar costs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, including, among others, employment, trade, healthcare, tax, data protection, securities and privacy laws and regulations. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable laws. Additional legal or regulatory requirements or more stringent interpretations of applicable requirements could increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the cost of compliance. Failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, profitability and results of operations.\nWe have received a notice from Nasdaq advising us that we do not meet the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. If we are unable to maintain a listing on a national securities exchange, it could negatively impact the price and liquidity of our common stock, which could impair the value of your investment.\nOur common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market prior to January 8, 2020. In order to maintain that listing, we were required to satisfy minimum financial and other listing requirements. On July 8, 2019, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notified us that we did not meet the $1.00 minimum bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days as required by Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \"Minimum Bid Price Requirement\"). In accordance with Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2020, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. We were unable to comply with the bid price requirement during the applicable grace period, and on December 20, 2019, the Company filed an application to transfer the listing of its common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market and request the additional 180-day compliance period offered on that market.\nOn January 7, 2020, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market approving the transfer of the listing of the Company's common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Accordingly, the Company was granted an additional 180-day grace period, or until July 6, 2020, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company\u2019s common stock was transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market effective as of January 8, 2020, and continues to trade under the symbol \u201cSMRT.\u201d The Nasdaq Capital Market operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements.\nOn April 16, 2020, Nasdaq announced that, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related extraordinary market conditions, Nasdaq is providing temporary relief from bid price and other requirements through June 30, 2020. As a result, we have until September 18, 2020 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nTo regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and qualify for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the minimum bid price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock must be at least $1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the additional grace period. If the Company does not regain compliance during this additional grace period, its common stock would be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. As part of its transfer application, the Company notified Nasdaq that if the stock price does not recover sufficiently during the additional grace period, the Company intends to take actions to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.\nThe delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and could result in other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, and fewer business development opportunities. Any such developments could impair the value of your investment.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that may, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures,\" we identified a material weakness in our control over financial reporting related to information systems access. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weakness, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures were not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously issued financial results. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness; however, we cannot guarantee that these steps have been sufficient or that we will not have a material weakness in the future. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 77530, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "SMRTQ"}
