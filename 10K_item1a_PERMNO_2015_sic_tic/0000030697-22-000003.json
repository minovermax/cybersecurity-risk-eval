{"cik": "30697", "company": "Wendy's Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2022, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry Conditions\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects for an extended period of time.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures adversely affected customers, workforces, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. Governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 have caused consumers to avoid or limit travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we updated our brand standard to include the closure of all dining rooms except where there were specific needs, or a drive-thru or pick-up window option was not available, subject to applicable federal, state and local requirements. Substantially all Wendy\u2019s restaurants continued to offer drive-thru and delivery service to our customers. During the second quarter of 2020, we began implementing our restaurant and dining room reopening process through a phased approach in accordance with federal, state and local requirements, with customer and team member safety as our top priority. As of January 2, 2022, substantially all restaurants were open across the Wendy\u2019s system, and the majority of restaurants had dining rooms open.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales were significantly negatively impacted, and our customer counts continue to be negatively impacted. Even as mobility continues to increase, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining, and consumer spending may continue to be adversely impacted for an extended period of time as a result of decreased consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on new restaurant development and restaurant reimaging. For example, in 2020, due to the uncertain and challenging economic and market conditions, we delayed construction of certain new Company-operated restaurants and reimaging of existing Company-operated restaurants and also extended the new restaurant development and Image Activation requirements of our franchisees by one year. These or similar delays could affect our ability to drive future growth in our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on our franchisees\u2019 operations and financial condition. Following the onset of the pandemic, we took certain actions to support our franchisees, including extending payment terms for royalties, extending or abating payment terms for advertising fund contributions and offering to defer base rent payments on properties owned by the Company and leased to franchisees. To the extent our franchisees experience financial distress, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition through delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions or rent.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy\u2019s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors. These delays or interruptions could impact the availability of certain food items at Wendy\u2019s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core menu products. For example, we experienced disruptions to our beef supply beginning in early May 2020 as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges. As a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy\u2019s system restaurants. While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption and the beef supply subsequently returned to normal levels across the Wendy\u2019s system, the pandemic has continued to impact our supply chain and there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future. Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to identify and transition the impacted business to alternative suppliers or distributors in a timely manner.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to labor shortages or increased labor costs. The risk or perceived risk of contracting the virus, as well as vaccine mandates or other governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to adversely affect restaurant operations, including the ability or cost of adequately staffing restaurants. If a significant percentage of our or our franchisees\u2019 workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, travel limitations, vaccine mandates or other governmental actions or restrictions, our operations and the operations of our franchisees may be negatively impacted, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Following the onset of the pandemic, we took several actions to help support our employees and protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, such as implementing a new emergency sick leave policy, providing temporary wage increases to restaurant employees and purchasing additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials, which contributed to increased operating costs.\nThe impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes. However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 worsen, our ability to comply with certain debt covenants under our securitized financing facility could be adversely affected. Additionally, negative changes to our credit ratings due to the impact or expected impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on our existing indebtedness, our ability to access additional capital, our cost of borrowing and our overall liquidity position and financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, those related to brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing, performance of the breakfast daypart and international operations. We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nCompetition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy\u2019s restaurants, could hurt our brand.\nThe market segments in which Wendy\u2019s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts. Further, Wendy\u2019s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains. Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends. Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower\ncost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share.\nMoreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy\u2019s restaurants operate and target our customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. Wendy\u2019s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants. This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy\u2019s restaurants. All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates, labor shortages, increases in inflation and declines in consumer confidence and spending. If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in our restaurants and those of our franchisees. There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence. Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants, including markets in which our Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of the Wendy\u2019s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Material declines in the amount of discretionary spending or consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand. If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, including with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends or environmental or social concerns, Wendy\u2019s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.\nRisks Related to Brand Perception and Value\nOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers\u2019 loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, customer health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents, social and environmental sustainability matters or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer\ndemand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products.\nOur results of operations are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of sales at their franchised restaurants, advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy\u2019s system. If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs. In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of social media platforms, including social media and news aggregation websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience. The rising popularity of social media has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. The dissemination of information via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition. This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues. In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with and loyalty to us. Failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues. Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve. A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties. Social media risks could also arise from employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy\u2019s brand.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business.\nOur intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy\u2019s brand or restaurant system. Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant legal fees and diversion of resources. If we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy\u2019s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy\u2019s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries. Some countries\u2019 laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for \u201cWendy\u2019s\u201d or similar marks. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy\u2019s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy\u2019s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.\nWe cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable. If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses. In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nFood safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.\nFood safety is a top priority for Wendy\u2019s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy\u2019s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy\u2019s or the restaurant industry. This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy\u2019s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy\u2019s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses, food tampering, contamination or mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages. The Wendy\u2019s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants. These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.\nAs of January 2, 2022, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy\u2019s system were operated by franchisees. Wendy\u2019s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them. Wendy\u2019s also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, all of which is done independent of Wendy\u2019s. Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand\u2019s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations. In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy\u2019s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees are an integral part of our business, growth and brand strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, digital commerce platforms and technologies and execution of the breakfast daypart, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition. In addition, Wendy\u2019s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive. Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher\npercentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies.\nWe receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline and our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase. Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases. If franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or fail to perform under or extend their leases or subleases with us, or if we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty and rental revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants. Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations. These factors include, among others, (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iii) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (v) construction and development costs, particularly in highly competitive markets; (vi) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and (vii) adverse weather conditions. Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our development strategy could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy also includes an increased focus on non-traditional development, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens. The inability of us or our franchisees to execute our non-traditional development strategy, including meeting development goals, achieving anticipated sales results and upholding the value of the Wendy\u2019s brand, could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us.\nWe continue to implement our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy\u2019s restaurants and building new Wendy\u2019s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs. Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy\u2019s restaurants or improve our results of operations. There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company. In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including reductions in royalty and national advertising payments and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements. It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities. Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program. If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.\nWe continue to optimize the Wendy\u2019s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image Activation program. The success of this initiative is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to\nnegotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations. Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases. Our system optimization initiative also places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources. If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Wendy\u2019s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth, including through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various risks, including general transaction and business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the diversion of management. Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.\nWe have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to the normal risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, insurance, demographic trends, supply chain management, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances. A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.\nWe generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term. Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities and capital repairs and replacements. We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent, taxes and maintenance costs for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nThe breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and we may be unable to achieve or maintain market share or reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.\nWendy\u2019s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system in March 2020 and recently announced plans to launch breakfast in Canada in the second quarter of 2022. The Company and franchisee leadership worked closely to align on a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model. However, we may be unable to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits due to competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established in the breakfast daypart, or other factors, including operational complexity, food and labor costs, supply chain management, lack of consumer acceptance, discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts and changes to customer mobility and daily routines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative\nimpacts on restaurant margins. The continued active support and engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful performance of the breakfast daypart. The breakfast daypart may require significant financial resources, including the Company\u2019s plans to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns. Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will continue to be profitable.\nIn addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of restaurants, the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners and ongoing disruptions and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.\nWendy\u2019s opened Company-operated and franchised restaurants in the United Kingdom in 2021 and plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model. New markets may have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations. In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate. Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Supply Chain and Labor\nChanges in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor costs. Increases in commodity costs, particularly beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect our future results of operations. Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, industry demand, energy costs, food safety concerns, animal disease outbreaks, product recalls and government regulations. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in weather patterns, including related to climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients. In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from actual or perceived effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy and water resources. The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business if not properly mitigated. We could also be adversely impacted by the cost of products raised or grown in accordance with our responsible sourcing criteria, including those related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare, as availability of products that can be assured to meet those criteria are generally smaller and more concentrated, and may be more costly, than the markets for conventionally raised or grown products that are not assured to meet those criteria. Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in decreased customer counts at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to\ndo so could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWendy\u2019s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, labor shortages, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees. Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants. If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to delays or interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy\u2019s restaurants, which could impact the availability and cost of certain food items at Wendy\u2019s restaurants.\nWe do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy\u2019s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy\u2019s independent purchasing co-op. QSCC manages, for the Wendy\u2019s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume. We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC. If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy\u2019s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition, Wendy\u2019s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business, results of operations and brand perception could also be adversely impacted by unionization efforts or other campaigns by labor organizations affecting our employees or the employees of our franchisees or by our responses to any such efforts or campaigns. As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to increased labor costs and labor shortages, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership structure.\nWe believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel. Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and performance of our business. In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies and alternative methods of delivery.\nAdvances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement, online ordering and delivery. Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments, industry trends and evolving legal and regulatory requirements could result in a loss of customers and related market share. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand.\nAn increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering and delivery. We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business. If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth. If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy\u2019s mobile app and online ordering system, do not meet customers\u2019 expectations in terms of security, privacy, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as mobile order pick-up and carryout. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us. The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. If we are unable to successfully respond to the challenges arising from our increased reliance on our digital business, this could have a material adverse impact on our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or breach of our systems or technology could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology, including those controlled by third-party providers, to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our systems and technology. The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively, an interruption in our systems or technology or a breach in security of our systems or technology could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our systems and technology or transition to replacement systems or technology. Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including the expansion and acceleration of our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our systems and technology. Any security breach involving our or our franchisees\u2019 systems or technology could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud. Also, despite our considerable efforts and resources to secure our systems and technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship with key technology providers, including their personnel, resources, technological expertise, systems and technology and their ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth. The inability of us or our providers to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives while maintaining our brand value and perception could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA number of retailers and other companies have experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems, such as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by malicious actors. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties. Our business involves the collection and retention of customer data, including, in some instances, credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing, digital ordering and related services. We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we will likely incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations. A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident and maintain insurance coverage to address certain cyber incidents, these measures do not guarantee that a cyber incident could not occur or that our business, reputation and financial condition will not be adversely affected by such an incident.\nAs previously reported, in 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents. As a result of those incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in separate class actions brought by consumers and financial institutions, and certain of our directors and executive officers were named as defendants in a stockholder derivative action. These and any other claims or investigations related to cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect how we and our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management, have a negative effect on our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.\nWendy\u2019s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the \u201cMaster Issuer\u201d) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015. Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the \u201cSecuritization Entities\u201d), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement. The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.\nThe Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Senior Notes are subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or\nother amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy\u2019s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the Company had approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet. Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $300.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis. This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company\u2019s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company\u2019s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company\u2019s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company\u2019s business or industry or the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged. Further, the Company\u2019s outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is expected to be discontinued in 2023. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.\nThe ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows. In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company\u2019s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness, the Company is subject to risks related to certain commitments, guarantees and other liabilities. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. If consumer preferences change and customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company. The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.\nThe Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future. If new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nHolders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time. In addition, because Wendy\u2019s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.\nA substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.\nNelson Peltz, our Chairman, Peter May, our Senior Vice Chairman, Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 19% of the Company\u2019s total voting power as of February 22, 2022. These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.\nOn December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201cTrian Agreement\u201d) with Messrs. N. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership. This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock. The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable. Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.\nGeneral Business Risks\nComplaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWendy\u2019s customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant. We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand. While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental\nmatters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole.\nExisting and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEach Wendy\u2019s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. Governmental authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for opening new restaurants. More stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws. We and our franchisees are each also subject to laws and regulations that govern employment matters at the federal/national, state/provincial and local levels. In the United States, this includes laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, family leave, paid sick time and similar requirements and a variety of other laws, regulations and rules. Changes in laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies, including the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, require modifications to our business practices, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a California law enacted in 2019 adopted a worker classification test to be used when determining employee or independent contractor status. Although we do not believe this law applies to our franchisees or their employees, changes in the legal framework of employment or franchise liability could negatively impact our business, particularly if such changes result in any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or interpretation or judicial decision determining that Wendy\u2019s is an employer of its franchisees or a joint employer with our franchisees or otherwise imposing liability for employment-related claims or impacting our employment relationships based on theories of joint employer liability or other theories of vicarious liability. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to legal and compliance risks related to privacy and data collection, protection and management of certain data and information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area. These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future. Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Additionally, evolving laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use. As a result, we have\nexperienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and make commitments, establish goals or set targets with respect to various environmental and social issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets. If we are not effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. In addition, the actions needed to achieve our commitments, goals and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain associated with social and environmental sustainability matters.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.\nWe currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or the declaration of war. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, products liability, auto liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents. Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future cyber incidents. In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry. Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nNew accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency. Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations. Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues. While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events.\nUnforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities (including acts of war, terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations, supply chains and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 89818, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "WEN"}
