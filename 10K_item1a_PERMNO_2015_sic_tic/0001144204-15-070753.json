RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in our common shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially, the trading price of our common shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other filings and public disclosures. In particular, the following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of net losses and limited cash flow to sustain our operations.\nWe currently have limited revenue from product sales of Stellar KLHTM, and anticipate our planned research and development expenditures, as well as our general and administrative expenses, will be greater than our revenues for the foreseeable future. We have incurred net losses of ($2,843,029) in fiscal 2015, ($8,439,523) in fiscal 2014 and ($14,495,779) in fiscal 2013, and as of September 30, 2015, we have an accumulated deficit of ($35,335,315) since inception. To date, we have not paid dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. We have historically relied upon the sale of common shares to help fund our operations and meet our obligations. Any future additional equity financing would cause dilution to current shareholders. If we do not have sufficient capital for our operations, management would be forced to reduce or discontinue our activities, which would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on the success and market acceptance of Stellar KLHTM and we may never recoup our investment into its research and development.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources into the development of Stellar KLHTM. We anticipate that in the near term our ability to generate revenues will depend solely on the commercial success of Stellar KLHTM, which depends upon its market acceptance by purchasers in the pharmaceutical market and the future market demand and medical need for products and research utilizing KLH. The degree of market acceptance of Stellar KLHTM depends on a number of factors including: the advantages and disadvantages of Stellar KLHTM as compared to other KLH proteins; our ability to educate the industry about the high quality, sustainable and traceable qualities of Stellar KLHTM; product efficacy; customer service; and the price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness of Stellar KLHTM as compared to our competitors.\nWe may not be able to meet demand for KLH from either ocean harvest or internally raised sources.\nWe are dependent upon a supply of Giant Keyhole Limpets (Megathura crenulata) for KLH production. The range of the Giant Keyhole Limpet in the wild is limited, and due to the lack of a regulated harvest, the wild stocks of Giant Keyhole Limpets are believed to be declining. If the wild stocks are depleted, and our hatchery and aquaculture operations are unable to produce sufficient supplies of captive Giant Keyhole Limpets to meet demand, it would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is geographically concentrated and if a catastrophic event, such as a hurricane, an earthquake or coastal flooding, were to impact our facilities, our business may be disrupted which could result in serious harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur aquaculture operations, research and manufacturing facilities, laboratory space, and executive offices are all located in Port Hueneme, California, a coastal city located along the Pacific Ocean. To date, we have conducted all of our aquaculture operations, research and manufacturing at these facilities and there are no backup facilities for any of these operations. In July 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Ostiones Guerrero SA de CV to secure a strategic site in Baja California, Mexico for the development of an additional aquaculture locale and expansion of our KLH production. However, we do not anticipate the site to be available for manufacture and production until 2018. There can be no assurance that these expansion plans will result in successful development of additional sites of research and manufacturing and KLH production outside of our Port Hueneme location. If a hurricane, an earthquake or other natural disaster, including coastal flooding, or a virus affecting our limpet colony, were to impact our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture our KLH products, which would have a serious disruptive impact on our business and a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. While we carry personal property insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses from any damage or interruption of our business operations resulting from a hurricane, an earthquake, coastal flooding or other catastrophic event.\nOur expansion plans include the design and development of aquaculture infrastructure and KLH production in Mexico which presents substantial risks to our business and personnel. We may never recoup our investment into this location.\nWe plan to develop an additional aquaculture locale and expand KLH production on leased, undeveloped land in Baja California, Mexico. We are currently engaged in a three-year study to assess the suitability of the site, and to initiate the design, expansion, and development of aquaculture resources and KLH production facilities there. There are certain administrative, legal, governmental and societal risks to operating in Mexico that could adversely impact our ability to expand our operations there. Any one or more of the risks that could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our expansion and therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 regional political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 rate of crime in Mexico;\n\u00b7 ability to hire and maintain a significant work force;\n\u00b7 burdensome and evolving government regulations;\n\u00b7 cooperation of various departments of the Mexican government in issuing permits, and inspecting our operations on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 providing adequate security for our employees; and\n\u00b7 change in the value of the Mexican peso.\nWe compete with other companies in KLH production and manufacturing that may have greater resources than we do.\nWe believe we are one of only three companies of who are manufacturing KLH starting material for GMP- grade KLH products; however, there are other companies offering clinical- and research-grade KLH products. Of these three companies, we believe we are the only company that offers GMP grade KLH supported by fully traceable manufacturing methods. Our Stellar KLHTM products are similar to KLH-based products produced by other companies. Some of these other companies, both public and private, have greater financial and personnel resources than us, and have greater sales and marketing experience in the industry than us. If they are able to produce and sell KLH products for less than us, it will have a negative effect on our operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities and currently depend on third parties for certain steps in our manufacturing operations, which could prevent us from marketing our products.\nWe contract with third party vendors (CMOs and CTOs) for certain steps in the manufacture and testing of our products, and may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with qualified manufacturers in order to produce sufficient supplies of our finished products.\nWe are currently dependent upon a small number of contractors and locations for certain steps in our manufacturing operations, namely fill/finish of vialed products and release testing. We do not currently have backup manufacturing capacity for some of our key products. If we are unable to retain our current contractors, or are unable to obtain new contractors to provide manufacturing services in a timely manner and on similar terms, it will have a negative effect on our operations. Further, these contract manufacturers and testing organizations provide services to many biotechnology and research companies, and such third party contractors may not provide acceptable quality, quantity or costs required by us. In addition, they may not be able to provide the services required on a schedule acceptable to us. These issues may result in us being unable to manufacture our products in the required quantities or at an acceptable cost, which would have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe have been, and expect to continue to be in the future, significantly dependent on collaboration and supply agreements for the development and sales of Stellar KLHTM.\nIn conducting our research and development and commercialization activities, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on collaboration and supply agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, commercial partners, universities, governmental agencies and not-for-profit organizations, for strategic, technological, and financial resources. The inability to secure agreements on acceptable terms, the termination of these relationships, or failure to perform by us or third parties who are subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks, under their respective agreements or arrangements with us, would substantially disrupt or delay our research and development and commercialization activities, including anticipated commercial sales. Any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur sales in international markets subject us to foreign currency exchange and other risks and costs, which could harm our business.\nSubstantial portions of our revenues are derived from outside the United States; primarily from Europe and Asia. We anticipate that revenues from international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. All our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars. However, if the effective price of our products were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, demand for our products could decline and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers face uncertainties related to regulatory approval, which could reduce the market for our products.\nA primary market for our Stellar KLHTM products is its use as a component of active immunotherapies under development. The therapeutic drug industry is subject to significant government regulation, and many of the products being developed by our customers that utilize our Stellar KLHTM are not yet approved for commercial sale. Before regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products is granted, a drug must be demonstrated through preclinical testing and clinical trials to be safe and effective for their intended use in humans. The process to determine safety and efficacy, including clinical trials, is expensive and prolonged. The time necessary to complete these processes and clinical trials and to submit applications for the regulatory approvals is difficult to predict and is subject to numerous factors, and such clinical trials may not be successful. Larger or later stage clinical trials may not produce the same results as earlier trials. Successful results in clinical trials may not result in regulatory approval, due to certain factors including unacceptable side effects or safety issues. Currently only one of our customers or partners has filed an application in any country for marketing approval of a product encompassing our Stellar KLH\u2122 protein. If regulatory approval is granted for any drug or product that utilizes Stellar KLHTM, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, which include registration, manufacturing, labeling, advertising and promotion, packaging, distribution, record keeping and reporting, and storage. Manufacturing facilities, both those operated by us and by our contractors, would be subject to continual review and inspection, and failure to meet these regulatory requirements can interrupt, delay, or shut down these facilities. Previously unknown problems may result in regulatory restrictions on such products, including withdrawal from the marketplace. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for products developed by our customers that use Stellar KLHTM, or failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals altogether, would have a negative effect on market demand for our Stellar KLHTM products, and have a negative effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could result in competitive harm to our Company.\nOur success and ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including by obtaining patent protection in the United States and other countries, or through protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information. When appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, whether by obtaining patents or through trade secret protection, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not have adequate remedies for any infringement or funds to take action against those infringing any of our intellectual property rights, or if our trade secrets otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. There can be no assurance that any current or future patents held, licensed by or applied for by us will be upheld, if challenged, or that the protections afforded will not be circumvented by others. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which often involve licensing agreements, are frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and licensed rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. If we enter litigation in regards to our business or to protect or enforce our patents, it may involve substantial expenditures and require significant management attention, even if we ultimately prevail.\nThe patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain. The degree of patent protection we require may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights, provide sufficient exclusivity, or preserve our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7 we might not have been the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7 the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u00b7 any patents we obtain or license from others in the future may not encompass commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 any patents we have obtained, will obtain or license from others in the future may not be valid or enforceable; and\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited.\nIn addition, some of our technologies are not covered by any patent application and we rely instead on confidentiality agreements and trade secret law to protect such intellectual property rights. We require all of our employees and consultants to sign confidentiality agreements. The agreements also oblige our employees, and to the extent practicable, our consultants, and advisors, to assign to us ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. We cannot be sure that these agreements will maintain confidentiality, will prevent disclosure, or will protect our proprietary information or intellectual property, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property.\nThe failure of our patents, patent applications, applicable intellectual property law or our confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information, including our trade secrets, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive advantages and on our operations and financial position.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products and our technologies.\nThere are numerous recent changes to the U.S. patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) that may have a significant impact on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights. In particular, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was adopted in September 2011. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. Under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. With respect to patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013, if we are the first to invent but not the first to file a patent application, we may not be able to fully protect our intellectual property rights and may be found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others if we continue to operate in the absence of a patent issued to us. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have recently become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of any patents that issue, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement, and defense of patent applications and any patents we may obtain. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents and patent applications or any patents we may obtain and our ability to obtain and enforce or defend additional patent protection in the future.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our products and technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when possible, U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We have obtained patent protection for our non-lethal extraction methods of hemocyanin in the United States and other countries. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.\nWe plan to file other international patent applications directed to patentable features of our products and technologies from time to time. If patent rights are obtained in foreign jurisdictions, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our pending patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our product.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and patent applications, any patents that may be issued to us or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or patent applications, or other of our intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement or misappropriation claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents or claiming that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For any patents and patent applications we may license, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any such patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our products. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that our patent applications or patents, if issued, are invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly, or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent applications do not cover the technology. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nOur trade secrets are difficult to protect and misappropriation could reduce the market for our products.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties. This is generally referred to as having the \u201cfreedom to operate.\u201d The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings, both in the United States and internationally, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, such proceedings are lengthy, costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is highly uncertain. We may become involved in protracted and expensive litigation in order to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others, or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others.\nPatent applications in the United States are, in most cases, maintained in secrecy until approximately 18 months after the patent application is filed. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to a product or method similar to ours may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application covering our products, methods or other claims, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, such as an interference or derivation proceeding in the USPTO or similar proceedings in other countries, to determine the priority of invention. In the event an infringement claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and, if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim, we may be subject to injunctions or damage awards.\nIn the future, the USPTO or a foreign patent office may grant patent rights to our claims to third parties. Subject to the issuance of these future patents, the claims of which will be unknown until issued, we may need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to further use, develop or commercialize such products or methods. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate, we could be subject to injunctions, and compelled to pay significant damages, including punitive damages. In any cases where we in-license intellectual property, our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such licensing agreements could harm our business.\nIf we become involved in any patent litigation or other legal proceedings, we could incur substantial expense, and the efforts of our technical and management personnel could be significantly diverted. A negative outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may be restricted or prevented from using or developing methods, or manufacturing and selling our products in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or an administrative proceeding, or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses. Further, even if we are successful in defending against claims of infringement, such litigation could be burdensome and costly, and divert management\u2019s attention away from executing our business plan.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nCertain of our employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, we may lose our rights to such information, in addition to paying monetary damages. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nWe have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience and capabilities. We will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products.\nWe currently have limited experience in the marketing, sales and distribution of KLH-based therapeutic or diagnostic products. Depending on market acceptance of our Stellar KLHTM products, we may need to expand our capabilities. We may not be able to establish such additional capabilities in-house, and then will need to enter into agreements with third parties to successfully perform these tasks. If we contract or make arrangements with third parties for the sales and marketing of our products, our revenues will be dependent on the efforts of these third parties, whose efforts may not be successful. If we market any of our products directly, we must either internally develop or acquire a marketing and sales force, which would require substantial resources and management attention.\nWe rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our senior management team, and we will need to hire and retain other highly skilled personnel to maintain and grow our business.\nOur ability to be successful in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical, sales and other personnel. Our performance is substantially dependent on the research and development and business development expertise of Frank Oakes, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Catherine Brisson, our Chief Operating Officer. We do not have employment agreements currently in effect with Mr. Oakes and Dr. Brisson, and they are free to leave their employment with us at any time.\nThere is little possibility that this dependence will decrease in the near term. The loss of the services of Mr. Oakes or Dr. Brisson, or the increased demands placed on our key executives and personnel by our continued growth, could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to execute our strategies. Our continued success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business.\nIn addition, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial and research personnel in all areas within our organization. We plan to continue to grow our business and will need to hire additional personnel to support this growth. We believe that there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions, and we compete for key personnel with other biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. It is often difficult to hire and retain these persons, and we may be unable to timely replace key persons if they leave or be unable to fill new positions, as they become available, requiring key persons with appropriate experience. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to maintain and grow our business could suffer significantly.\nWe are subject to the risk of product liability claims, for which we may not have, or be able to obtain, adequate insurance coverage.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to product liability claims in the event of adverse effects, even in respect to products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale. Such claims might be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers or by pharmaceutical companies, or others selling or utilizing our Stellar KLHTM products. Although we currently maintain liability insurance for our products, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient and affordable insurance coverage for all claims that may occur. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face environmental risks related to handling regulated substances and hazardous materials.\nOur research and clinical development activities, as well as the manufacture of materials and products, are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and clinical development, both now and in the future, may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nWe deal with hazardous materials and must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business and/or give rise to significant liabilities.\nAs we operate a manufacturing facility, we are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant. In the event of a violation of these requirements, including from accidental contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages exceeding our available financial resources. We could be subject to monetary fines, penalties or third party damage claims as a result of violations of such laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required at our facility. As an operator of real property and a generator of hazardous materials and wastes, we also could be subject to environmental cleanup liability, in some cases without regard to fault or whether we were aware of the conditions giving rise to such liability. In addition, we may be subject to liability and may be required to comply with new or existing environmental laws regulating pharmaceuticals in the environment. Environmental laws or regulations (or their interpretation) may become more stringent in the future. If any such future revisions require significant changes in our operations, or if we engage in the development and manufacturing of new products or otherwise expand our operations requiring new or different environmental controls, we will have to dedicate additional management resources and incur additional expenses to comply with such laws and regulations.\nIn the event of an accident, applicable authorities may curtail our use of hazardous materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, with respect to our manufacturing facility, we may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations and may become subject to the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use of hazardous materials in our manufacturing process.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nThe price of our common shares may be subject to substantial volatility.\nAlthough our common shares are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market in the United States and the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, there can be no assurance that an active public market will be sustained for our common shares. If there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our common shares, the market price for our common shares may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common shares would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading price of our common shares may be more volatile.\nFurthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common shares could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u00b7 our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u00b7 investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u00b7 our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u00b7 changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u00b7 announcements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common shares could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nIf we cannot meet Nasdaq\u2019s continuing listing requirements and Nasdaq rules, Nasdaq may delist our securities, which could negatively affect our company, the price of our securities and your ability to sell our securities.\nOn November 3, 2015, our common shares were approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and began trading on November 5, 2015. In order to meet certain initial listing requirements of Nasdaq, on September 2, 2015, we effected a consolidation of our issued and outstanding common shares on the basis of one (1) post-consolidation common share for every ten (10) pre-consolidation shares. We also amended our Articles to comply with certain corporate governance requirements set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Guide, which amendment was approved at a special meeting of our shareholders. These actions were time consuming and required substantial expense on the part of our Company. Although our shares are currently listed on Nasdaq, in the future, we may not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, which require, among other things, a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for common shares listed on the exchange. If we are unable to satisfy the Nasdaq criteria for maintaining our listing, our securities could be subject to delisting. Trading of our securities would continue on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada and, in the United States, would thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.\u2019s \u201celectronic bulletin board.\u201d As a consequence of any such delisting, our shareholders would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our securities.\nWe may require additional financing or financings, which would result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nManagement currently estimates that our operations, including research and development, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses, will require approximately $5.5 million for the next 12 months. We believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2015 are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations for at least the next 12 months. Notwithstanding the above, we may decide to expand operations, undertake strategic acquisitions or determine some other business need. In such case, we would then seek financing for such events through the sale of additional common shares, debt securities or bank loans. Our ongoing research and development activities may be dependent upon our ability to obtain funds, which is expected to include the sale of common shares, as well as possible debt financings, joint ventures, or other means. Such sources of financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain such financing may result in delay or indefinite postponement of research and development of our Stellar KLHTM. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but unissued common shares, or securities convertible into common shares, could result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective holders of common shares and may be on terms less favorable to us.\nWe could be deemed a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d in the future, which could have negative consequences for U.S. investors.\nWe would be designated as a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d, or a PFIC, under the meaning of Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if (a) 75% or more of our gross income is \u201cpassive income\u201d (generally, dividends, interest, rents, royalties and gains from the disposition of assets producing passive income) in any taxable year, or (b) at least 50% of the average value of our assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. If we are designated a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. shareholder holds our common shares, it would likely result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for such U.S. shareholder, including, but not limited to, any gain from the sale of our common shares would be taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to capital gain, and such gain and certain distributions on our common shares would be subject to an interest charge, except in certain circumstances. In addition, U.S. shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurances that we would be able to satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a PFIC, or that we would supply U.S. shareholders with the information that such U.S. shareholders require to make certain elections available under the Code that are intended to mitigate the adverse tax consequences of the PFIC rules. The PFIC rules are extremely complex. A U.S. shareholder of our common shares is encouraged to consult a tax advisor regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common shares.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware.\nThe material differences between the British Columbia Business Corporations Act (the \u201cBCBCA\u201d) as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) which may be of most interest to shareholders include the following: (i) for material corporate transactions (such as amalgamations, other extraordinary corporate transactions, amendments to the notice of articles and amendments to the Articles), the BCBCA generally requires a two-thirds majority vote by shareholders (and, in addition, especially where the holders of a class of shares are being affected differently from others, approval will be required by holders of two-thirds of the shares of such class voting in a meeting called for that purpose), whereas the DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders for similar material corporate transactions; (ii) quorum for shareholders meetings is not prescribed under the BCBCA and is only 33-1/3% under our Articles; whereas, under the DGCL, quorum requires the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote to be present; and (iii) our Articles require a two-thirds majority vote of shareholders to pass a resolution for one or more directors to be removed, whereas the DGCL requires only the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders.\nRisks Related to an Emerging Growth Company\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and as a result, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues; (ii) the date we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; or (iii) the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u00b7 have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley;\n\u00b7 comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u00b7 submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholders advisory votes pursuant to the \u201csay on frequency\u201d and \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; and\n\u00b7 include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Exchange Act, and, instead, may provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nIf we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than information such security holders might receive from other public companies in which they hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15854, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EDSA"}
