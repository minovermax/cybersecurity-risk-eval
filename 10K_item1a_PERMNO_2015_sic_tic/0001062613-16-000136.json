{"cik": "1062613", "company": "FAIRPOINT COMMUNICATIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Our Substantial Indebtedness\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate substantially, which could negatively affect holders of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results, the volume of sales of our common stock, the limited number of holders of our common stock and the resulting limited liquidity in our common stock, dilution, developments in the communications industry, the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, short interests in our common stock, competitive factors, regulatory developments, labor disruptions, economic and other external factors, general market conditions and market conditions affecting the stock of communications companies in general. Communications companies have, in the past, experienced extreme volatility in the trading prices and volumes of their securities, which has often been unrelated to operating performance. High levels of market volatility may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock prices. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our common stock.\nWe have substantial indebtedness which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total gross indebtedness was approximately $924.5 million (including $2.1 million of capital leases) and $60.8 million was available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility, net of $14.2 million outstanding letters of credit. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information, including maturities. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to paying the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the amount of dividends we could pay to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from engaging in strategic transactions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the communications industry generally;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have a less significant debt burden; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nOur ability to continue to fund our debt service requirements and to reduce our indebtedness may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund our debt service requirements, reduce our indebtedness or satisfy debt covenant requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nIn addition, our borrowings under our Credit Agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") bear interest at a variable rate based on a British Bankers Association LIBOR rate (\"LIBOR\"), subject to a floor of 1.25%. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a combined notional amount of $170.0 million of these borrowings; these agreements were effective September 30, 2015. If the relevant LIBOR increases above the level of the floor, the interest payments on our variable rate debt will increase and adversely affect our cash flow. Conversely, while LIBOR remains below 1.25%, we may incur interest costs above market rates. While our interest rate swap agreements and any future agreements we enter into may limit our exposure to higher interest rates, these agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nWe may incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the current risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and our Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications\nand exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.\nTo operate and expand our business, service our indebtedness and meet our other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to repay or refinance our indebtedness at maturity or otherwise or to fund our operations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy such obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our indebtedness, to fund our operations and to fund planned capital expenditures, unanticipated capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend largely upon our financial condition and operating performance, including our ability to execute on our business plan. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, such as any pension contributions required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), that are beyond our control. For example, the minimum amount of pension contributions that we are required to make, which may be substantial, are determined under ERISA.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts, including under our Revolving Facility, if necessary to meet our cash needs, will depend on our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our debt agreements. If our operating results are not adequate to meet the financial ratio tests in our debt agreements or if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt requirements, we will be required to restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness, which we may not be able to accomplish under such circumstances on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may have to consider other options, including:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nreduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances;\n\u2022\nobtaining additional capital; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure or refinance the applicable debt.\nOur ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness may depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, and any such restructuring and/or refinancing may come with higher interest rates and more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nAn inability to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay or refinance our indebtedness at maturity or otherwise or to fund our operations could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants, under certain circumstances, limit us and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement or the Indenture. In addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement require us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests depends on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information regarding the Credit Agreement and the Indenture.\nFairPoint Communications is a holding company and depends upon the cash flows of its operating subsidiaries to service its indebtedness and meet its other cash flow needs.\nFairPoint Communications is a holding company and conducts no operations. Accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend largely upon the cash flows of its operating subsidiaries and the distribution of cash by those subsidiaries to it through repayment of loans, dividends, management fees or otherwise. Distributions to FairPoint Communications from its subsidiaries will depend on their respective operating results and will be subject to restrictions under, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe laws of their jurisdiction of organization;\n\u2022\nthe rules and regulations of state and federal regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nagreements of those subsidiaries, including agreements governing their indebtedness, if any; and\n\u2022\nregulatory orders.\nFairPoint Communications' subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available, whether in the form of loans, dividends or other distributions, to it. Any inability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nLimitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards, and other factors requiring us to pay cash to satisfy our tax liabilities in future periods, may affect our ability to fund our operations, make capital expenditures and repay our indebtedness.\nEffective December 31, 2011, our NOLs were substantially reduced by the recognition of gains on the discharge of certain debt pursuant to the Plan. In addition, our emergence from bankruptcy resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). This followed previous ownership changes resulting from our initial public offering in February 2005, which resulted in an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of the United States federal income tax laws addressing NOL carryforwards, alternative minimum tax credits and other similar tax attributes. Moreover, the Merger resulted in a further ownership change for these purposes. As a result of these ownership changes, there are specific limitations on our ability to use these NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes from periods prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. Furthermore, additional limitations on the use of NOLs could arise in the future if a 50% or more change in ownership as defined under the Code were to occur. Although we do not expect that these limitations will materially affect our United States federal and state income tax liability in the near term, it is possible in the future if we were to generate taxable income in excess of the limitation on usage of NOL carryforwards that these limitations could limit our ability to utilize the carryforwards and, therefore, result in an increase in our United States federal and state income tax payments over the amount we otherwise would have, had we not experienced an ownership change. In addition, in the future we will be required to pay cash to satisfy our tax liabilities when all of our NOL carryforwards have been used or have expired. Limitations on our usage of NOL carryforwards, and other factors requiring us to pay cash taxes, would reduce the amount available to fund our operations, make capital expenditures and service our indebtedness in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nConcentration of ownership among stockholders may prevent new or current investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nBased on Schedules 13D and 13G filed by the respective holders, as of February 26, 2016, there are some institutional holders who own 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of corporate transactions and could gain significant control over our management and policies as a result thereof.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may\nalso make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we had 27,051,162 shares of common stock outstanding. All such shares are freely traded except for any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers, employee insiders and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available. In addition, Angelo Gordon & Co., L.P. (\"Angelo Gordon\") and entities advised by Angelo Gordon have certain registration rights with respect to the common stock they hold or may acquire in the future.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock, or other securities, from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. In the event any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be significant. We may also grant registration rights covering these shares or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe provide services to customers over access lines, and since we have been losing access lines, if our efforts to mitigate this decline and transition to alternative revenue is not successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities may be materially adversely affected.\nWe, along with the communications industry in general, have experienced a decline in access lines and network access revenues and will be further unfavorably impacted in the long-term by the FCC's recent CAF/ICC Order on intercarrier compensation. See \"Risks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\" for specific risks associated with the impact of regulatory reform. We generate revenue primarily by delivering voice and data services over access lines. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we continued to experience access line loss. These losses resulted mainly from competition, including competition from bundled offerings by cable companies, the use of alternate technologies, including wireless, as well as challenging economic conditions and the offering of DSL services.\nWe expect to continue to experience net access line losses. Our strategy of providing broadband and advanced data services, such as Ethernet over fiber and copper plant, may not be sufficient to offset the revenue impact of continued access line loss. Our inability to retain access lines and successfully offset such losses with alternative revenue could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe provide access services to other communications companies, and if these companies were to find alternative means of providing services, become insolvent or experience substantial financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities may be materially adversely affected.\nWe originate and terminate calls on behalf of long distance carriers and other interexchange carriers over our network in exchange for payment of switched access charges. Interstate and intrastate access charges represented approximately 29.9% of our total revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Terminating switched access rates are scheduled to decline under the FCC's recent CAF/ICC Order. See \"Risks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\" for specific risks associated with the impact of regulatory reform. We may not be successful in offsetting these declines through regulatory replacement mechanisms or operational means. Further, should one or more of these carriers find alternative means of providing services, loss of revenues from these carriers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities. In addition, should one or more of the carriers that we do business with become insolvent or experience substantial financial difficulties, our inability to timely collect access charges from them could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe are subject to competition that may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe face intense competition from a variety of sources for our voice, network transport and Internet services in nearly all of the areas we now serve. Regulations and technology change quickly in the communications industry and changes in these factors historically have had, and in the future may have, a significant impact on competitive dynamics. In most of our service areas, we currently face competition from wireless carriers for voice services and increasingly for Internet services. As technology and economies of scale have improved, competition from wireless carriers has increased and is expected to further increase. We also face increasing competition from wireline and cable television companies for our voice and Internet services. We estimate that most of the customers that we serve have access to voice, network transport and Internet services through a cable television company. Wireline and cable television companies have the ability to bundle their services, which has and is expected to continue to intensify the competition we face from these providers. VoIP providers, Internet service providers and satellite companies also compete with our services and such competition has increased and is expected to continue to increase in the future. In addition, many of our competitors have access to a larger workforce and have substantially greater name-brand recognition and financial, technological and other resources including, in the case of cable television providers, free advertising on their video services.\nIn addition, consolidation and strategic alliances within the communications industry and the development of new technologies have had and may continue to have an effect on our competitive position. We cannot predict the number of competitors that will emerge, particularly in light of possible regulatory or legislative actions that could facilitate or impede market entry, but increased competition from existing and new entities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nCompetition may lead to loss of revenues and profitability as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nloss of customers (given the likelihood that when we lose customers for local service, we will also lose them for all related services);\n\u2022\nreduced network usage by existing customers who may use alternative providers for voice and data services;\n\u2022\nreductions in the prices we charge to meet competition; and\n\u2022\nincreases in marketing expenditures and discount and promotional campaigns to incent customers to choose our services.\nPrice increases or price retention for certain products and customers may result in an acceleration of access line losses or an unanticipated decline in our growth-oriented products, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nFrom time to time, we expect to implement price increases for certain products and customers. Although we intend for the price increase to provide a net revenue benefit, it is possible that customers will disconnect at a faster rate than they otherwise would have, which could negate the benefit of the price increase. Additionally, a weaker economic environment can result in increased demand by our customers for price reductions at the same or better level of service. In some of our more competitive markets, we may need to offer more favorable terms to our customers for contract renewal, which could result in reduced profitability. Despite continuous efforts by our sales force to retain customers, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to renew customers dissatisfied with our contract renewal terms.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate new technologies, respond effectively to customer requirements or provide new services.\nRapid and significant changes in technology and new service introductions occur frequently in the communications industry and industry standards evolve continually, including but not limited to a transition in the industry from primarily voice products to data services. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, profitability or the industry. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require unbudgeted upgrades or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our existing services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or obsolescence or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and sell new services to our existing customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont make our business susceptible to local economic and regulatory conditions and consumer trends, and an economic downturn, recession or unfavorable regulatory action in any of those states may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nOur service territory spans 17 states. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 83% of our total residential voice lines were located in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont (including certain of our Telecom Group service companies). As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend significantly upon economic conditions and consumer trends in these markets. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of these markets could result in a further decrease in demand for our services and resulting loss of access line equivalents which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nIn certain areas of our service territory, the need for our services is seasonal (including either winter or summer), which may result in revenue fluctuations quarter over quarter. While we attempt to forestall seasonal disconnects or seasonal suspends, some revenue fluctuations continue to occur and once a customer disconnects or suspends, he or she may not return as a customer.\nIn addition, if state regulators or legislators in Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont were to take an action that is adverse to our operations in those states, we could suffer greater harm from that action than we would from action in other states because of the concentration of our operations in those states.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against claims that we infringe upon others' intellectual property rights or may need to seek third-party licenses to expand our product offerings.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may receive similar notices or be involved in similar lawsuits in the future. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of affected technology, may require us to enter into licensing agreements requiring license payments that we would not otherwise have to pay or may require us to pay damages. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our operating expenses may increase. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect the way we conduct business.\nSimilarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be restricted, made more costly or delayed.\nWe depend on third party providers for certain of our billing functions, IT services, including network support and improvements, and for the provision of our long distance and bandwidth services.\nWe have agreements with outside service providers to perform a portion of our billing functions and for our provision of long distance and bandwidth services. We also rely on certain third parties for IT services, including network support and improvements.\nIf these service providers are unable to adequately perform such services or if one of them experiences a significant degradation or failure with respect to such services, it could result in disruptions in our billing, IT systems and/or long distance and bandwidth services. Service failures could also result in internal controls deficiencies, which could adversely impact our overall control assessment of internal control in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Furthermore, if these agreements are terminated for any reason, we may be unable to find an alternative service provider in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, and may be unable ourselves to perform the services they provide.\nWith respect to the agreements governing our long distance and bandwidth services, these agreements are based, in part, on our estimate of future supply and demand and may contain minimum volume commitments. If we overestimate demand, we may be forced to pay for services we do not need. If we underestimate demand, we may need to acquire additional capacity on a short-term basis at unfavorable prices, assuming additional capacity is available. If additional capacity is not available, we may not be able to meet this demand. In addition, if we cannot meet any minimum volume commitments, we may be subject to underutilization charges, termination charges or rate increases.\nIf any of the foregoing events occur with respect to our third-party providers, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities could be materially adversely affected.\nA network disruption could cause delays or interruptions of service, including for 9-1-1 service, which could cause us to lose customers, engage in litigation, incur fines or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and uninterrupted service over our expanded network. Disruptions in our service could occur as a result of events that are beyond our control. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include:\n\u2022\nphysical damage to our transmission network including poles, cable and access lines;\n\u2022\nwidespread power surges or outages;\n\u2022\nsoftware defects in critical systems;\n\u2022\ncapacity limitations resulting from changes in our customers' usage patterns;\n\u2022\nhuman error; and\n\u2022\ndamage intentionally inflicted upon the network or our other infrastructure.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we have experienced and in the future may experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. In addition, certain portions of our network may lack adequate redundancy to allow for expedient recovery of service to affected customers. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers, engage in litigation and incur fines and/or expenses or capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nAny failure or inadequacy of our IT infrastructure could harm our business.\nA major failure or inadequacy of our IT infrastructure could harm our business. The capacity, reliability and security of our internal IT hardware and software infrastructure are important to the operation of our current and future business, which would suffer in the event of major system failures. Our inability to expand or upgrade our IT hardware and software infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, increased acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions, the issuance of service quality credits, and the diversion of development resources. If any of the foregoing events occur with respect to our IT infrastructure, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these newer services continues to grow, our high-speed Internet customers will likely use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we may choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected markets. While we believe demand for these services may drive high-speed Internet customers to pay for faster broadband speeds, we may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nA cyber-attack that bypasses our IT and/or network security systems causing an IT and/or network security breach may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information and could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to organizations' IT systems or network elements are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts include covertly introducing malware to companies' computers and networks, impersonating authorized users, or \"hacking\" into systems. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. Significant network security failures could result in the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information; the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our customers' personally identifiable information, intellectual property and/or confidential business information; the unauthorized use or disabling of our network elements; or damage to our reputation among customers and the public. These consequences could harm our competitive position,\nsubject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to litigation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers' or licensees' confidential information, we may incur liability as a result.\nNatural catastrophes or terrorism may damage our network or adversely affect the financial markets.\nA major earthquake, hurricane, tornado, winter storm, flood, fire, terrorist attack, cyber-attack or other similar disruption could damage our network, network operations centers, call centers, data centers, central offices, corporate headquarters or other facilities. Such an event could interrupt our services, adversely affect service quality, overwhelm customer support and ultimately harm our business and reputation. Although we have implemented measures that are designed to mitigate the effects of such events, we cannot predict all of the potential impacts of such events. We maintain insurance coverage for some of these events; however, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our networks or operate key systems as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses or loss of customers and associated revenue.\nEven if the major event does not directly impact us, these events could more broadly cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and world financial markets and economy, which would adversely affect our business.\nBecause our post-emergence consolidated financial statements reflect fresh start accounting adjustments made upon emergence from bankruptcy and because of the effects of the transactions that became effective pursuant to the Plan, financial information in our post-emergence financial statements is not comparable to our financial information for periods prior to the Effective Date, including certain statements contained therein.\nUpon our emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with guidance under the applicable reorganization accounting rules, pursuant to which our reorganization value was allocated to our assets in conformity with guidance requiring use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. In addition to fresh start accounting, our consolidated financial statements reflect all effects of the transactions contemplated by the Plan. Therefore, our consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of operations subsequent to the Effective Date are not comparable in many respects to our consolidated statements of financial position and consolidated statements of operations for periods prior to the Effective Date.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released and may continue to release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management's best estimates as of the date the guidance is provided. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent our actual results which could fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. Notwithstanding this, we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such outside analysts or investors.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions or the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date the guidance is provided. Actual results may differ from the guidance and the differences may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, users of this guidance are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on any such guidance.\nAny inability to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances discussed therein could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be material.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.\nOur success depends upon the talents and efforts of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team, due to retirement or otherwise, and the inability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nOur ability to successfully manage reductions in our workforce could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nReductions in our workforce could adversely impact our ability to operate effectively and, therefore, could adversely impact our customer service, result in higher regulatory penalties and/or reduce our ability to achieve our operational goals.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and therefore subject to collective bargaining agreements. If disputes arise, or if we are unable to successfully renegotiate these agreements at an appropriate time or on terms acceptable to us, workers subject to these agreements could engage in work stoppages or other concerted activities, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 1,660 of our approximately 2,700 employees were covered by 13 collective bargaining agreements. In October 2015, we received notice from the National Labor Relations Board of the intent of one additional group of 33 of our employees to organize and we are currently bargaining with that group. After ratification of the collective bargaining agreements on February 22, 2015, our agreements with the IBEW and the CWA in northern New England covering approximately 1,700 employees in the aggregate expire in August 2018. Disputes with regard to the terms of any of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future as our current contracts expire could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. We have experienced work stoppages in the past upon the expiration of collective bargaining agreements. If represented workers were to engage in future work stoppages or other concerted activities, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, including network disruptions, IT failures, service backlog, internal control failures and/or regulatory compliance issues, and/or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities. Additionally, future renegotiation of labor agreements or the provisions of such labor agreements could adversely impact our service reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nThe amount we are required to contribute to our qualified pension plans and post-employment benefit plans is impacted by several factors that are beyond our control and changes in those factors may result in a significant increase in future cash contributions.\nWe sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees that will provide them benefit payments, if eligible, after their retirement. These qualified pension plans are subject to funding requirements determined under ERISA and the Code. Required pension contributions may be impacted by several factors, including fluctuations in the discount rate used to calculate the funding target, unfavorable differences in actual experience relative to the assumptions used to determine the liabilities in these plans, the performance of the pension plan asset portfolio and the number of retirees in the qualified pension plan covering non-represented employees who elect to receive lump sum distributions. Unfavorable fluctuations or adverse changes in any of these factors are beyond our control and may diminish the funded status of our pension plans, thereby significantly increasing the contributions we are required to make under ERISA and the Code.\nThe represented employees pension plan was closed to new participants and benefits under the prior formula were frozen as of October 14, 2014. Future benefit accruals for service on and after February 22, 2015 are at 50% of prior rates and are capped at 30 years of total credited service. Of our projected benefit obligation for our pension plans, approximately 10% reflects the non-represented employees.\nNon-represented employees covered by the non-represented employees pension plan have the option to elect to receive their accrued vested benefit in the form of a lump sum payment. Represented employees covered by the represented employees pension plan are no longer able to elect to receive their accrued vested benefit in the form of a lump sum effective with the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW and the CWA on August 2, 2014. As the discount rate used to calculate lump sum payments are currently lower than the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial liabilities in the non-represented employee pension plan, the value of a lump sum payment exceeds the actuarial liability for the participant, which creates an actuarial loss in the pension plan for non-represented employees when paid. As such, a lump sum payment depletes the plan's assets more than the corresponding reduction in the plan's liability, which thereby reduces the funded status of the plan. If a significant number of\neligible non-represented employees retire and elect to receive their accrued vested benefit in the form of a lump sum payment, which is beyond our control, the qualified pension plan covering these participants may experience a significant reduction in its funded status, which could materially increase future required contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $1.0 million in plan settlement expense as the cumulative amount of lump sums paid during 2015 exceeded the expected service and interest cost for 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced actual losses on qualified pension plan assets totaling approximately 1.9%. The actuarially-determined funded status of our pension plans is dependent on the market value of the assets held by each plan. As such, a significant decline in the market value of the pension plans' assets could result in us having to make additional contributions to these plans.\nLegislation enacted in 2014 changed the method for determining the discount rate used for calculating a qualified pension plan's unfunded liability for ERISA and Code purposes, which improved our pension plans' funded status on an ERISA basis. There are no assurances of any future legislation to provide similar relief or to extend the benefits of relief provided by this legislation. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Liquidity and Capital Resources -Pension Contributions and Post-Employment Benefit Plan Expenditures\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe also sponsor a post-employment benefit plan that provides medical, dental and life insurance benefits to eligible non-represented employees and former represented employees and, in some instances, to their spouses and families. The level of contributions required from us under these plans is dependent on the number of eligible retirees that elect coverage under the plan and the level and cost of health services used by those eligible retirees, each of which are beyond our control. Inflation in medical and dental costs in the future will increase future contributions. Effective August 28, 2014, active represented employees are no longer eligible for this post-employment benefit plan. Upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements on February 22, 2015 and for 30 months thereafter, active represented employees who retire and meet the eligibility requirements and their spouses are eligible to receive certain monthly reimbursements of medical insurance premiums for healthcare plans until the retired employee reaches age 65 or dies. As a result of these factors, the payments we are required to make in relation to the above may also increase.\nIncreasing cash requirements to fund benefits under our qualified pension and post-employment benefit plans and the represented employee limited reimbursement arrangement may impact our liquidity position and limit our operational flexibility. These future cash requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nSee note (10) \"Employee Benefit Plans\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information.\nOur long-lived assets and non-amortizable intangible assets may become impaired in the future.\nAt December 31, 2015, in addition to our net property, plant and equipment of $1,118.8 million, we have net amortizable intangible assets of $44.7 million and a non-amortizable intangible asset of $39.2 million. Amortizable long-lived assets must be reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Non-amortizable long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever indicators of impairment exist. Indicators of impairment could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nan inability to perform at levels that were forecasted;\n\u2022\na permanent decline in market capitalization;\n\u2022\nimplementation of restructuring plans;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry trends; and/or\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates or capital expenditures levels.\nSituations such as these could result in an impairment that would require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital expenditures.\nWe require significant capital expenditures to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. While we have historically been able to fund capital expenditures from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving facility, the other risk factors described in this section could materially reduce cash available from operations or significantly increase our capital expenditure requirements, and these outcomes may result in our inability to fund the necessary level of capital\nexpenditures to maintain, upgrade or enhance our network. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of internal control systems required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including accelerated reporting requirements and expanded disclosures regarding evaluations of internal control systems. With respect to internal control over financial reporting, standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board define a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the future in accordance with the annual assessments and quarterly evaluations required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective which could result in sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. In addition, any such material weakness could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, prevent us from providing timely financial statements or meeting our reporting requirements both with the SEC and under our debt obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\n\"Net neutrality\u201d and broadband Internet access service legislation or regulation could limit our ability to operate our broadband business profitably and to manage our broadband facilities efficiently.\nIn order to continue to provide quality high-speed data service at attractive prices and to offer new services, we believe we need the continued flexibility to respond to changing consumer uses and demands, to manage bandwidth usage efficiently and to continue to invest in our networks. In 2010, the FCC adopted \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that curtailed our operational flexibility. A federal appeals court vacated these rules in January 2014, after which the FCC adopted new regulations governing \"Broadband Internet Access Services\" at its February 26, 2015 Open Meeting (the \"Order\"). \"Broadband Internet access service\u201d will now be classified as a \"telecommunications service\" under Title II of the Communications Act. The Order prohibits \"unjust and unreasonable practices\" by broadband Internet access providers. The Order prohibits broadband Internet access providers from blocking access to legal content, applications, services and non-harmful devices. It prohibits broadband Internet access providers from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. It also prohibits broadband Internet access providers from favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration and from prioritizing their own content or services over those of unaffiliated entities. Other than paid prioritization which is prohibited, broadband Internet access providers are allowed to engage in reasonable network management practices, though it is not currently known what such practices will be defined to include. Broadband services that do not flow over the public Internet are exempt from these rules. The Order allows consumer complaints to be brought to the FCC under Title II of the Communications Act.\nWe cannot predict what impact, if any, these new rules may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or the market price of our outstanding securities or whether Congress will modify these rules through pending legislative proposals.\nWe are subject to significant regulations that could change in a manner adverse to us.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed by Congress or regulators. In addition, the following factors could have a significant impact on us:\nRisk of loss or reduction in revenues associated with regulated filings, rules or tariffs. A portion of our revenues comes from intrastate and interstate network access charges, which are paid to us by interexchange carriers for originating and terminating communications traffic. Through 2011, our revenues also included various forms of high-cost USF support payments. Starting in 2012, these forms of universal service funding were replaced by CAF. See \"Item 1. Business-Regulatory and Legislative Environment\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nAs described in \"Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Legislative Environment,\" we have accepted most of the CAF Phase II support offered to us during 2015. We risk not being able to fulfill the obligations of the CAF Phase II program, which includes specific location requirements and technical obligations associated with speed, latency, data provision and pricing. These requirements and obligations may prove costly to implement. Failure to timely implement our CAF Phase II obligations by the interim milestones (40%, 60% and 80% of locations built out by December, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively) may result in a\nportion of funds being delayed at each interim milestone. Failure to build out at least 50% of locations required by an interim milestone may result in a loss of all funds and therefore this continuing revenue stream.\nThe CAF/ICC Order fundamentally reforms the ICC system that governs how communications companies bill one another for terminating traffic, gradually phasing out these charges. Additional reforms have been proposed. The reforms adopted by the FCC in its order will significantly change the access charge system and, if not offset by a revenue replacement mechanism, could potentially result in a significant decrease in or elimination of access charges. Regulatory developments of this type could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nRisk of re-regulation of wholesale network services provided to retail and wholesale customers. Pursuant to forbearance from the regulation of high-speed interstate services that was deemed granted to Verizon in 2006 and transferred to us by the FCC in its order approving the Merger, we offer high-speed interstate services on a deregulated basis. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to investigate potential changes to the regulation of special access services. Several parties filed petitions in 2011 and 2012 asking the FCC to reverse the 2006 forbearance granted to Verizon. The FCC has issued a comprehensive data request to gather granular information from all providers of special access-like high speed services and this data request was completed in February 2015. The purpose of the data request is to provide the FCC with information that can be used to evaluate competition for special access-like services. It is not clear what actions, if any, the FCC will take in these proceedings. Orders resulting from these proceedings could adversely affect pricing and regulation of these services.\nThe FCC also is considering changes to its rules governing who contributes to the USF support mechanisms, and on what basis. Any changes in the FCC\u2019s rules governing the manner in which entities contribute to the USF could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nRisk of loss of statutory exemption from burdensome interconnection rules imposed on ILECs. Our rural LECs generally are exempt from the more burdensome requirements of the 1996 Act governing the rights of competitors to interconnect to ILEC networks and to utilize discrete network elements of the incumbent\u2019s network at favorable rates. To the extent state regulators decide that it is in the public interest to extend some or all of these requirements to our rural LECs, we may be required to provide UNEs to competitors in our rural telephone company areas. As a result, more competitors could enter our traditional telephone markets than are currently expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nRisks posed by costs of regulatory compliance. Regulations create significant compliance and administrative costs for us. Our subsidiaries that provide intrastate services are generally subject to certification, tariff filing and other ongoing regulatory requirements by state regulators. Our interstate and intrastate access services are currently provided in accordance with tariffs filed with the FCC and state regulatory authorities, respectively. Challenges in the future to our tariffs by regulators or third parties or delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and, if successful, these challenges could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nOur acceptance of CAF Phase II funding through the FCC's universal service program requires that we satisfy specific broadband service obligations in locations approved by the FCC within deadlines established by the FCC. If we fail to meet these deadlines, or our broadband service fails to satisfy FCC performance standards, we could be subject to penalties, refunds and other enforcement action by the FCC. In the two states where we declined CAF Phase II support, we cannot predict whether competitors will win a competitive bid for support in our service territories.\nIn addition, our Northern New England operations are subject to regulations not applicable to our rural operations, including but not limited to requirements relating to interconnection, the provision of UNEs, and the other market-opening obligations set forth in the 1996 Act. In approving the transfer of authorizations to us in the Merger, the FCC determined that our non-rural operations would be subject to the same regulatory requirements that currently apply to Bell Operating Companies. The FCC also stated that we would be entitled to the same regulatory relief that Verizon New England had obtained in the region. Any changes made in connection with these obligations or relief could increase our non-rural operations\u2019 costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities. Moreover, we cannot predict the precise manner in which the FCC will apply the Bell Operating Company regulatory framework to us.\nOur business also may be affected by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to open Internet access, assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland security, pole attachments, minimizing environmental impacts, protecting customer privacy or addressing other issues that affect our business. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the FCC might\nmodify its rules or what compliance with those new rules might cost. Similarly, we cannot predict whether or to what extent federal or state legislators or regulators might impose new network access, security, environmental or other obligations on our business.\nRisk of losses from rate reduction. Our LECs that operate pursuant to intrastate rate-of-return regulation are subject to state regulatory authority over their intrastate telecommunications service rates. State review of these rates could lead to rate reductions, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nFor a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see \"Item 1. Business-Regulatory and Legislative Environment\" included elsewhere in this Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 90555, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FRP"}
