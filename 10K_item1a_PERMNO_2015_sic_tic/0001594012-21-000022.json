RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nEconomic and Market Area\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a national emergency in the United States in March 2020, continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments, including in New Jersey and New York, have taken, and continue to take, unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including by instituting quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed with some level of success, including in New Jersey and New York, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly. Reporting of COVID-19 case data as of January 20, 2021 indicates that, on a national level, the number of reported positive cases in the United States now exceeds 24 million and the seven-day average of new positive cases exceeds 200,000. This figure is more than twice the volume of new positive cases per week reported as of November 1, 2020, when the spread of COVID-19 in the United States began to increase at its most rapid pace since the onset of the pandemic. Despite governmental approval of three COVID-19 vaccines and the initial distribution of these vaccines to certain high-risk populations, the sustained surge of positive cases across a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States has increased pressure on governmental officials to reverse the relaxation of activity restrictions, which could lead to the shutdown of certain businesses and operations and exacerbate economic uncertainty and instability related to the pandemic.\nThe governmental and social response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, more than 70 million people nationwide have filed claims for unemployment. For the week ending January 8, 2021, first-time unemployment claims increased to 965,000, representing the largest volume of new weekly unemployment claims since late August 2020. As of the end of December 2020, the national unemployment rate was 6.7%. Although an improvement from the 11.1% national unemployment rate observed in June 2020, the current rate of unemployment is substantially higher than the 3.6% national unemployment rate observed in January 2020 prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. Through the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, Congress revived and extended through March 14, 2021 several unemployment insurance benefit programs established under the CARES Act which had previously expired. In addition, the new Administration has proposed a substantial COVID-19 relief package which includes, among other programs and provisions, direct stimulus payments, small business funding and further extension and expansion of unemployment insurance programs. The prospects and timing for congressional consideration of the package, as well as the substantive modifications that may be pursued by Congress, are not certain at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and related efforts to contain it, have caused significant disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and have increased economic and market uncertainty and volatility. To help address these issues, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury notes have declined to historic lows. At its June and July meetings, the FOMC continued its commitment to this approach, indicating that the target federal funds rate would remain at current levels until the economy is in position to achieve the FOMC\u2019s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In its November and December meetings, the FOMC indicated that overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part due to the policy measures that have been implemented to ensure the flow of credit to U.S. businesses and households, but that the pandemic will continue to pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. Accordingly, the FOMC did not deviate from the approach described above as established in earlier meetings. In addition, in order to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve indicated that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities to sustain proper functioning of the financial markets.\nCongress and various state governments and federal agencies have taken actions to require lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers, and legislation passed in 2020 has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, through Section 4022 of the CARES Act, Congress provided relief to borrowers with federally-backed one-to-four family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 by allowing such borrowers to request forbearance, regardless of delinquency status, for up to 360 days. Section 4022 of the CARES Act also prohibited servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020. The statutory period for relief afforded under Section 4022 of the CARES Act expired on December 31, 2020; however, in recent weeks the Biden Administration and the federal agencies that guarantee covered mortgages each have extended the moratorium deadline beyond that date.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d) announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (each an \u201cEnterprise\u201d) would extend the single-family moratorium on foreclosures on Enterprise-guaranteed mortgage loans and evictions involving Enterprise-owned properties through March 31, 2021 and that borrowers of Enterprise-guaranteed mortgage loans who had entered forbearance for a period that is scheduled to expire may be eligible for an extension of the forbearance period of up to three additional months. On February 16, 2021, the Administration, together with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture extended and expanded the mortgage forbearance and foreclosure relief programs administered by those agencies. Specifically, the joint action (i) extended the foreclosure moratorium for relevant borrowers through June 30, 2021; (ii) extended the mortgage payment forbearance enrollment window until June 30, 2021 for relevant borrowers who wish to request forbearance; and (iii) provided up to six months of additional mortgage payment forbearance, in three-month increments, for relevant borrowers who entered forbearance on or before June 30, 2021. These actions followed a series of short-term extensions approved independently by the relevant agencies.\nUnder Section 4023 of the CARES Act, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 and the date of termination of the national emergency declaration, borrowers with federally-backed multifamily mortgage loans whose payments were current as of February 1, 2020, but who have since experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19, may request a forbearance for up to 90 days. Borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants during the duration of such forbearance. On December 23, 2020, the FHFA announced an extension of its forbearance program for qualifying multi-family properties through March 31, 2021. Moreover, on January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order extending the federal eviction moratorium issued through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--which was recently extended by Congress through January 31, 2021--through March 31, 2021. As part of the COVID-19 relief package proposed by the Administration, this eviction moratorium would be further extended through September 30, 2021 if adopted as proposed.\nAdditionally, in many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located, temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures have been enacted through a mix of executive orders, regulations, and judicial orders. Certain such relief orders have since expired, although several states, including New York and New Jersey, have extended their temporary orders and may continue to do so for so long as the public health emergency persists. In addition, in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation on June 17, 2020 that expands mortgage forbearance available for those experiencing financial hardship during the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation applies to those who have mortgages with state-regulated financial institutions and is intended to be an expansion of the CARES Act\u2019s mortgage forbearance provisions. The legislation provides up to one year of forbearance if the borrower\u2019s hardship persists and provides flexible payment options. Further, on December 28, 2020, Governor Cuomo signed the COVID-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2020, which prevents residential evictions, foreclosure proceedings, credit discrimination and negative credit reporting related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, this legislation imposes a moratorium on residential foreclosure proceedings and evictions in New York State until May 1, 2021. The New Jersey Legislature currently is debating several comparable legislative proposals; however, residential mortgage foreclosure and tenant eviction relief have been addressed to date through executive orders issued by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.\nCertain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Refer to the COVID-19 Pandemic section included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on the Company\u2019s loan portfolio by industry as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be fully reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we may be subject to any\nof the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital:\n\u2022because the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations and deaths varies significantly by state and locality, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may be deeper and more sustained in certain areas, including those in which we do business relative to other areas of the country;\n\u2022our ability to market our products and services maybe impaired by a variety of external factors, including a prolonged reduction in economic activity and continued economic and financial market volatility, which could cause demand for our products and services to decline, in turn making it difficult for us to grow assets and income;\n\u2022if the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which may reduce our ability to liquidate such collateral and could cause loan losses to increase and impair our ability over the long run to maintain our targeted loan origination volume;\n\u2022our delinquent, adversely classified assets and non-accrual loans could increase substantially if borrowers continue to experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance/payment deferral periods resulting in adversely impacted asset quality, capital and earnings. As of February 14, 2021, we had $756 million, or 3.6%, of loans deferring principal and/or interest payments as a result of COVID-19;\n\u2022our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022an increase in non-performing loans due to the COVID-19 pandemic would result in a corresponding increase in the risk-weighting of assets and therefore an increase in required regulatory capital;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022as the result of the reduction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022deposits, including municipal deposits, could decline if customers need to draw on available balances as a result of the economic downturn;\n\u2022a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022we face heightened cybersecurity risk in connection with our operation of a remote working environment, which risks include, among others, greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore our systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions--all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers;\n\u2022we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service or limitations on the business capacities of our vendors for extended periods of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our operations; and\n\u2022as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be unexpected developments in financial markets, legislation, regulations and supervisory expectations, and consumer and customer behavior.\nThe Company is not a traditional SBA lender however, we have been an active participant in the PPP. The PPP authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profits organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1% per annum and a maturity of two years if originated before June 5, 2020 and five years if originated on or after June 5, 2020. The PPP provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated. If not forgiven, these loans will be guaranteed by the SBA under the SBA\u2019s section 7(a) program. We sold approximately $328 million of PPP loans in December 2020 to The Loan Source, Inc. (\u201cLoan Source\u201d), a company with significant experience in the origination, funding and servicing of PPP loans, including the PPP loan forgiveness process. We had approximately $4.8 million of PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nThe PPP loan application submission deadline was August 8, 2020. However, on December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (\u201cEconomic Aid Act\u201d) was adopted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and reopened the PPP to certain businesses that satisfy applicable eligibility criteria. Specifically, among other things, the Economic Aid Act: (i) extends the original PPP (or the \u201cFirst Draw\u201d) deadline from August 8, 2020 to March 31, 2021; and (ii) establishes \u201cSecond Draw\u201d PPP loans, which enables certain entities to receive a second round of PPP credit. Any customer inquiries received by the Company regarding the second round of PPP will be referred to Loan Source.\nAs a result of our participation in the PPP, we may be subject to litigation and claims by borrowers in connection with the PPP loans that we have made, as well as investigation and scrutiny by our regulators, Congress, the SBA, the Treasury\nDepartment and other governmental authorities. Regardless of whether these claims and investigations may be founded or unfounded, if such claims and investigations are not resolved in a timely and favorable manner for us, they may result in significant costs and liabilities (including increased legal and professional costs) and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19 pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nA worsening of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeteriorating economic or business conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and unemployment levels, particularly in New York and New Jersey given our concentration in this region, may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in New York and New Jersey. In addition, a migration of individuals and businesses from urban areas, including New York City, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in similar ways given our concentration in New York City. At December 31, 2020, approximately $6.7 billion, or 42% of our commercial loans were to borrowers or secured by collateral in New York City.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and may pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services and non-bank industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. In addition, we compete with numerous online financial service providers who compete in the new digital fintech marketplace and who may not be subject to our regulatory requirements. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger bank and non-bank competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we can. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area and Northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.\nAsset Quality and Interest Rate\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If actual results differ significantly from our assumptions, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Bank regulators also periodically review our loan portfolio, the allowance for credit losses, and our assumptions underlying the determinations we have made regarding the allowance for credit losses, and as a result can require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial originations, our credit risk will increase.\nAt December 31, 2020, our portfolio of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans totaled $16.05 billion, or 76.9% of our total loans. We intend to continue to increase our originations of multi-family, commercial real estate, C&I and construction loans, which generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, local economy or the management of the business or property. In addition, our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings.\nOur C&I loan portfolio is unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans.\nOur C&I loan portfolio has increased to $3.58 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.28 billion at December 31, 2016. Consequently, a substantial portion of our C&I loans are unseasoned. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in the economic environment since 2016. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nWe continue to expand our commercial lending efforts and footprint, which may expose us to increased lending risks and may have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nIn an effort to diversify our loan portfolio, we have expanded our commercial lending team to include leveraged lending and equipment finance teams, as well as a healthcare lending team that originate loans nationally. We will continue to explore other markets within commercial lending. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and multi-family loans, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, some of our equipment finance portfolio relies on the residual values of the underlying equipment and therefore could be negatively impacted by a change in valuation. Because we are not as experienced with these new loan products and areas, we may incur losses or require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products effectively. At December 31, 2020, C&I loans represent approximately 17% of our total loans. In addition, at December 31, 2020, approximately 10% of our total commercial loans are to borrowers or secured by collateral located outside of New Jersey, New York and surrounding states.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest income we earn on our assets and the interest expense we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, because market interest rates change over time. In periods of rising short-term interest rates as well as flattening or inverted interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. An increase in interest rates can also result in decreased prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates may cause increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest the funds from faster prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our total securities portfolio was $4.12 billion. Unrealized net losses on debt securities available-for-sale are reported, after tax, as a separate component of equity. To the extent interest rates increase and the value of our available-for-sale portfolio decreases, our stockholders\u2019 equity will be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate net interest income sensitivity and the change in our economic value of equity over a range of interest rate scenarios. The economic value of equity analysis is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At December 31, 2020, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates increase evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no action to mitigate the effect of such change, the model projects that we would experience a 3.7% or $27.1 million decrease in net interest income. In a 200 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates scenario, the economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d) model projects a 2.0% or $70.1 million increase in EVE.\nSource of Funds\nPublic funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and liquidity position.\nPublic funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2020, $5.50 billion, or 28.2% of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities, predominately domiciled in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities, which are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB or investment securities. Given our use and concentration of these typically high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily interest-bearing demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and therefore their pricing is more sensitive to changes in interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net interest income.\nIn addition, the State of New Jersey is considering creating a State Bank, the purpose of which would be to promote economic development, commerce, and industry in the State. The proposal under consideration would permit State funds, including funds from State institutions and any State public source, to be held by the State Bank. Given the degree of our funding reliance on New Jersey-based municipal deposits and the potential lending ability of the proposed State Bank, we are uncertain of the impact this proposal may have on us. The possible loss of public funds on deposit may increase the costs of our funding needs, which could have a negative impact on our net income and negatively impact liquidity. The proposed legislation was first introduced in 2018, and in 2019, the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order establishing an implementation board to develop criteria for establishing a State Bank. At this time, there is no assurance that a State Bank will be established or what its powers or authority may be.\nFHLB funds are an important source of funding for the Company and reduced available capacity may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe borrow directly from the FHLB and various other financial institutions. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are unable to secure alternative funding or need to rely on more expensive funding sources, our operating margins, profitability and liquidity would be negatively impacted.\nRegulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDOBI, our chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the CFPB, with respect to consumer protection laws. As a bank holding company,\nthe Company is subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to shareholders, restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, compliance and privacy issues, BSA and AML compliance, and approval of merger transactions. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Bank, the Company and our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. New laws, regulations, and other legal and regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIf the bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 488% of Bank total risk-based capital at December 31, 2020, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 3% during the preceding 36 months.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares would be adversely affected.\nThe performance of our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios could be adversely impacted by recent or proposed changes in laws and regulation.\nOn June 14, 2019, the State of New York enacted legislation increasing restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (i) repealing the \u201cvacancy bonus\u201d and \u201clongevity bonus\u201d, which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20% each time a rental unit became vacant, (ii) eliminating high rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant\u2019s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (iii) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. As a result of this new legislation as well as previously existing laws and regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, the value of the collateral for our multi-family loans or the future cash flow of such properties could be impaired. It is possible that rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced or constrained, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral for the loan may be impaired.\nAny future increase in FDIC insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings.\nAs a \u201clarge institution\u201d within the meaning of FDIC regulations (i.e., greater than $10 billion in assets), the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premium is determined differently than smaller banks. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. Large institutions are subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments.\nCapital requirements for financial institutions have increased in recent years, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn 2015, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board instituted a new rule which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. This rule implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4% under prior rules); (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital, and resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5%. The required minimum capital conservation buffer increased in annual increments to 2.5% on January 1, 2019, which is the fully phased in conservation buffer. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements for the Bank and the Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nThe recent change in Administration could result in changes to tax laws and regulations.\nThe recent change in Administration could lead to changes in tax laws as well as changes in regulatory requirements. We are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. An increase in our corporate tax rate could have an unfavorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. Similarly, the Bank\u2019s customers could experience varying effects from changes in tax laws and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. In addition, changes to regulatory requirements could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nBusiness Issues\nWe will be required to transition from the use of LIBOR in the future.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after 2021. In November 2020, the LIBOR administrator announced plans to consult on easing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. The United States banking regulators concurrently issued a joint statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing USD LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Although the ARRC has announced SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, SOFR may not gain market acceptance or be widely used as a benchmark. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging\ninstruments and borrowings. The Company has approximately $7.61 billion in financial instruments which are indexed to USD-LIBOR at December 31, 2020. If LIBOR rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, we may incur expenses in effecting the transition, we may suffer a loss in the conversion to a new rate because the new rate may not be equal to what we were being paid on the LIBOR rate, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and security holders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In the interim, we have established a cross-functional team to develop transition plans to address potential revisions to documentation, as well as customer management and communication, internal training, financial, operational and risk management implications, and legal and contract management. In addition, we have engaged with our regulators and with industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitioning away from LIBOR.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our business, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur total assets have grown from approximately $23.17 billion at December 31, 2016 to $26.02 billion at December 31, 2020. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully attract deposits, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, acquire other banks and non-bank entities and enhance our market presence. In the event that we do not continue to grow, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality, remain in good standing with our regulators, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nWe could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell into the secondary market a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate. The whole loan sale agreements we enter into in connection with such loan sales require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there is a breach of any of representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We have established a reserve for estimated repurchase and indemnification obligations on the residential mortgage loans that we sell. We make various assumptions and judgments in determining this reserve. If our assumptions are incorrect, our reserve may not be sufficient to cover losses from repurchase and indemnification obligations related to our residential loans sold. Such event would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately $94.5 million recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could result in impairments to goodwill. We operate in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis results in impairment to goodwill, we would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGrowing by acquisition entails integration and certain other risks.\nAlthough we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, failure to successfully integrate systems subsequent to the completion of any future acquisitions could have a material impact on the operations of the Bank.\nFuture acquisition activity could dilute book value.\nBoth nationally and in our region, the banking industry is undergoing consolidation marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions. From time to time we may be presented with opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches and we may engage in discussions and negotiations. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values, and therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nWe currently utilize incentive-based payment arrangements with our employees as compensation practices. Potential regulatory changes to this practice could have an impact on our current practices and impact our results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future.\nWe may eliminate dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders, stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in domestic and global economies and other factors could cause our board of directors to consider, among other things, the elimination of or reduction in the amount and/or frequency of cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nWe continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthen our controls and ensure compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us.\nOur recruitment efforts may not be sufficient to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations.\nAs we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur failure to effectively deploy capital may have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe utilize our capital for general corporate purposes, including, among other items, organic growth, paying cash dividends, repurchasing shares of our common stock and acquisitions. Our failure to deploy capital effectively may reduce our profitability and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nInformation Security\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nThe Bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both the Bank and third-party service providers. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our business. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct or malfeasance, or failure or breach of third- party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with our own systems.\nWe handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. Our financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, or ATMs, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. This could adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and cause reputational harm.\nA cyber attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. We rely on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment.\nFinancial services institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, its employees or customers or of third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial institutions and several large retailers have disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers. We have experienced cyber security incidents in the past, although not material, and we anticipate that, as a larger bank, we could experience further incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches.\nMisconduct by employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. The Bank may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Bank to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of the population of the United States than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of its customers, the Bank cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nAs cyber threats and other fraudulent activity continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Any of these matters could result in our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs. In addition, any of the matters described above could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important service by any third-party could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent for the majority of our technology, including our core operating system, on third-party providers. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to us, we may experience significant disruption to our business. In addition, each of these third parties faces the risk of cyber attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. If any of our third-party service providers experience such difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to find alternative sources of such services. We are dependent on these third-party providers securing their information systems, over which we have limited control, and a breach of their information systems could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, service our clients or manage our exposure to risk and could result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information, which could have a material adverse impact on our business through damage to our reputation, loss of business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nAssurance cannot be provided that we could negotiate terms with alternative service sources that are as favorable or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all, thereby resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 90952, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ISBC"}
