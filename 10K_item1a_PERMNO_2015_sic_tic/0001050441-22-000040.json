Before making an investment decision, you should carefully read and consider the risk factors described below as well as the other information included in this report and other documents we file with the SEC, as the same may be updated from time to time. Any of these risks, if they actually occur, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us. In any such case, you could lose all or a portion of your original investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, our customers and other businesses in our market area, as well as counterparties and third party vendors. The resulting adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, varied and significant.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have resulted in widespread economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, certain customer segments and other businesses in our market area, as well as counterparties and third-party vendors. We continue to see the impact of the pandemic on our business, which could worsen, particularly since there remains ongoing uncertainty as to how long the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures will continue, both in our market area and the rest of the country. This impact has been significant, in certain areas, and could continue to be significant, adverse and potentially material. The full extent of this impact, and the resulting impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, remains inestimable at this time, and will depend on a number of evolving factors and future developments beyond our control and that we are unable\nto predict, including the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic; the nature, extent and effectiveness of containment measures; the proportion of the population that is willing to be vaccinated; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, unemployment, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact and continued availability of monetary, fiscal and other economic policies and programs designed to provide economic assistance to individuals and small businesses; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. An additional effect of COVID-19 is the adverse impact it has had, and will continue to have, on the workplace and employee retention and recruitment, as many industries shift to full or partial remote working environments. It is also possible that any adverse impacts of the pandemic and containment measures may continue once the pandemic is controlled and the containment measures are lifted.\nWe expect the potential negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain aspects of our business, financial condition, and results of operations to continue, and be the most severe in the following areas:\n\u2022Loan Credit Quality. The significant disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has been materially affecting the businesses of certain segments of our customer bases and of their customers, which impacts their creditworthiness, their ability to pay amounts owed to us and our ability to collect those amounts. Among the industry\u2019s most clearly impacted by the pandemic are the Accommodation and Food Service industry, exposure to which represents 8% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and the Retail Trade industry, which represents 1% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. In addition, approximately 7% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021 is secured by restaurants, hotels or retail properties. These areas may have a longer recovery period than other industries. Despite high home sales and mortgage refinance volumes and our strong performance in gains from residential mortgage loans for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, such volumes and performance may not be stable, especially if interest rates increase in 2022 as is widely expected. Economic conditions may likely result in future material declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, and an increase in tenants failing to make or deferring rent payments. A large portion of our loan portfolio is related to real estate, with 78% consisting of commercial real estate and real estate construction loans, and 85% of our loans being secured by real estate. As a result of actual or expected credit losses, we may downgrade loans, increase our allowance for loan losses, and write down or charge off credit relationships, any of which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, market upheavals are likely to affect the value of real estate and commercial assets. In the event of foreclosure, it is unlikely that we will be able to sell the foreclosed property at a price that will allow us to recoup a significant portion of the delinquent loan.\n\u2022Allowance for Credit Losses. We use a credit reserving methodology known as the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") methodology (which the Bank adopted effective January 1, 2020). Our ability to accurately forecast future losses under this methodology may be impaired by the significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and containment measures and the lack of a comparable precedent. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we reduced the ACL by $20.8 million, through reversals and charge-offs as the economy showed signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic due to the wide availability of vaccines and other treatments. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, or as our loan balances increase, we may need to record provisions for credit losses in the future. Our losses on our loans and other exposures could exceed our allowance.\n\u2022Deposit Business. As a result of government stimulus programs associated with COVID-19 related economic issues, deposit customers have retained a higher level of cash in deposit accounts. While increased low-interest deposits could have a positive impact in the short-term (if interest earned on the funds is in excess of the interest paid on deposits), we would not expect these funds to be replenished as stimulus programs are curtailed and customers use deposit funds for liquidity for their business and individual needs. If deposit levels decline, our available liquidity would decline, and we could be forced to obtain liquidity on terms less favorable than current deposit terms, which would in turn compress margins and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\u2022Interest Rate Risk. Our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent. The federal funds rate remained in this range for all of 2021. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions could increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results or financial condition.\n\u2022Operational Risk. Restrictions on our workforce's access to our facilities, due to concerns over COVID-19 contagion risk, could limit our ability to meet customer servicing expectations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. We rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information\ntechnology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. In response to COVID-19, we modified our business practices by directing a portion of our employees to work remotely from their homes to minimize interruptions to our operations. On November 1, 2021, the Bank adopted a hybrid work model in which certain employees split time between working at the office and working remotely. In mid-December, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 became prevalent and case rates increased again, the Company directed a portion of our employees to again work remotely, before moving back to the hybrid work model on February 1, 2022. Similar future actions in response to COVID-19 developments, such as new and more virulent variants, could result in our moving away from the hybrid model again. Transitioning back and forth between a hybrid work model and a work from home model may increase our operational risks and introduce additional operational risks, including (i) risks related to our work productivity; (ii) increased spending on our business continuity efforts; (iii) increased strain on certain risk management practices, including, but not limited to, the effectiveness and accuracy of our models, given the potential lack of data inputs and comparable precedent; (iv) risks related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering and other compliance programs; (v) increased cybersecurity risk, particularly as technology in employees' homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. Increased cyber risks in this context may include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers. The Company may also experience an increase in attempts at fraudulent activity, such as check fraud, as nefarious individuals try to exploit the dislocations caused by the pandemic.\n\u2022External Vendors and Service Providers. We rely on many outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications, real estate appraisal, loan servicers and local and federal government agencies, offices and courthouses. In light of the containment measures responding to COVID-19, many of these entities may limit the availability and access of their services, which may impact our business. For example, loan origination could be delayed due to the limited availability of real estate appraisers for the collateral. Loan closings could be delayed related to reductions in available staff in recording offices or the closing of courthouses, which slows the process for title work and mortgage and UCC filings. If the third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our operations.\n\u2022Strategic and Reputational Risk. The pandemic and containment measures have caused us to modify our strategic plans and business practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our colleagues, customers and business partners. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers or other stakeholders do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could materially adversely affect our business. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, as detailed in the Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may not be able to manage future growth and competition.\nWe have grown in the past several years through organic growth. We intend to seek further growth in the level of our assets and deposits within our existing footprint in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, although no additional branches are currently anticipated in 2022. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to be able to maintain our rate of growth at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and heightened competition in the Bank\u2019s market area, it has been difficult to maintain loan growth in recent quarters, and this is expected to continue in 2022 and beyond. In 2021, total net loans, the primary source of the Bank\u2019s revenue, declined, although total assets increased over the same period. Further, loan pricing pressures in the highly competitive market for high-quality commercial loans, and the costs and implementation risks associated with pursuing loan growth, has put pressure on loan portfolio yields and consequently the Bank\u2019s net interest margin and net income. Even as economic conditions may improve in future quarters, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our total net loans or re-achieve similar loan growth numbers as compared to periods prior to COVID-19 (or re-achieve meaningful increase in loan growth at all) in the short-term or long-term. Additionally, although deposit growth has been strong in the last two years, we may be unable to continue to increase our volume of loans and deposits or to introduce new products and services at acceptable risk levels for a variety of reasons, including an inability to maintain capital and liquidity sufficient to support continued growth. If we are successful in continuing our growth, we cannot assure you that further growth would offer the same levels of potential profitability, or that we would be successful in controlling costs and maintaining asset quality. Accordingly, an inability to maintain growth, or an inability to effectively manage growth, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and stock price.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation, operating results or stock price could be adversely impacted.\nAny failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls, or to effect remediation of any material weakness or significant deficiency, could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or stock price.\nManagement reviews and updates our systems of internal control and disclosure controls and procedures, as well as corporate governance policies and procedures, as appropriate. Any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur continued growth depends on our ability to meet minimum regulatory capital levels. Growth and shareholder returns may be adversely affected if sources of capital are not available to help us meet them.\nAs we grow, we need to maintain our regulatory capital levels at or above the required minimum levels. If earnings do not meet our current estimates, if we incur unanticipated losses or expenses, or if we grow faster than expected, we may need to obtain additional capital sooner than expected or we may be required to reduce our level of assets or reduce our rate of growth in order to maintain regulatory compliance. Under those circumstances net income and the rate of growth of net income may be adversely affected. The significant level of ADC loans in our portfolio, and new loans sought by customers, which may be required to be assigned a higher risk weight, could require us to maintain additional capital for these loans.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and the value of our shares may be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to grow our assets.\nSince opening for business in 1998, our asset level, loans and net income available to common shareholders have increased significantly. We may not be able to achieve continued growth in asset levels, loans, or earnings in future years. Moreover, as our asset size, loan portfolio and earnings increase, it may become more difficult to achieve high rates of increase. Additionally, it may become more difficult to achieve continued improvements in our expense levels and efficiency ratio. We may not be able to maintain the relatively low levels of nonperforming assets that we have experienced to date. Declines in the rate of growth of income or assets or deposits, and increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may have an adverse impact on the value of the common stock.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk in our operations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, pay deposits when withdrawn, and fund loan and investment opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. If a financial institution is unable to meet its payment obligations on a daily basis, it is subject to being placed into receivership, regardless of its capital levels. Our largest source of liquidity is customer deposit accounts, including noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts, which constituted 33% of our total deposits at December 31, 2021. If we are unable to increase customer deposits in an amount sufficient to fund loan growth, we may be required to rely on other, potentially more expensive, sources of liquidity, such as FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits and repurchase agreements, to fund loan growth, which could adversely affect our earnings, or reduce our rate of growth, which could adversely affect our earnings and stock price.\nWe also have a significant amount of deposits that are in excess of the maximum FDIC insurance coverage limits. At any time, customers who have uninsured deposits may decide to move their deposits to institutions which are perceived as safer, sounder, or \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d or could elect to use other non-deposit funding products, such as repurchase agreements, that may require the Bank to pay higher interest and to provide securities as collateral for the Bank\u2019s repurchase obligation. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had approximately $5.3 billion of uninsured deposits, or 53% of our total deposits.\nWhile we believe that our strong earnings, capital position, relationship banking model and reputation as a safe and sound institution mitigate the risk of losing deposits, there can be no assurance that we will not have to replace a significant\namount of deposits with alternative funding sources, such as repurchase agreements, federal funds lines, certificates of deposit, brokered deposits, other categories of interest bearing deposits and FHLB borrowings, all of which are more expensive than noninterest bearing deposits, and can be more expensive than other categories of deposits. While we believe that we would be able to maintain adequate liquidity at reasonable cost, the loss of a significant amount of deposits, particularly noninterest bearing deposits, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, net interest margin, rate of growth and stock price.\nWe may face risks with respect to future expansion or acquisition activity.\nWe may seek to selectively expand our banking operations through limited de novo branching or opportunistic acquisition activities. We cannot be certain that any expansion activity, through de novo branching, acquisition of branches of another financial institution or a whole institution, or the establishment or acquisition of nonbanking financial service companies, will prove profitable or will increase shareholder value. The success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the estimated cost savings and revenue enhancements from combining the businesses of the Company and the target company. Our ability to realize increases in revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to retain customers and employees, and to capitalize on existing relationships for the provision of additional products and services. If our estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to successfully combine companies, the anticipated cost savings and increased revenues may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any combination of banking institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from our bank. Customers may not readily accept changes to their banking arrangements that we make as part of or following an acquisition. Additionally, the value of an acquisition to the Company is dependent on our ability to successfully identify and estimate the magnitude of any asset quality issues of acquired companies.\nOur concentrations of loans may create a greater risk of loan defaults and losses.\nA substantial portion of our loans are secured by commercial real estate in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and substantially all of our loans are to borrowers in that area. We also have a significant amount of real estate construction loans and land related loans for residential and commercial developments. At December 31, 2021, 85% of our loans were secured or partially secured by real estate, primarily commercial real estate. Management believes that the commercial real estate concentration risk is mitigated by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis. Of these loans, $1.1 billion, or 14.9% of portfolio loans, were land, land development, and construction loans. An additional $1.4 billion, or 19.2% of portfolio loans, were commercial and industrial loans, which are generally not secured by real estate. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or the sale or development of the underlying property and, as a result, is more likely to be adversely affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. While we believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations expose us to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand. In that event, we would likely experience lower earnings or higher losses. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in our market area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area\u2019s economy, our ability to develop our business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of our loans may be adversely affected, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced.\nCommercial, commercial real estate and construction loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgages loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate and construction loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in: a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, an increase in loan charge-offs, and/or an increase in operating expenses which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Residential Lending department may not continue to provide us with significant noninterest income.\nIn 2021, the Bank originated $1.1 billion and sold $1.2 billion of residential mortgage loans to investors, as compared to $1.3 billion originated and $1.2 billion sold to investors in 2020. The residential mortgage business is highly competitive, and highly susceptible to changes in market interest rates, consumer confidence levels, employment statistics, the capacity and willingness of secondary market purchasers to acquire and hold or securitize loans, and other factors beyond our control. Changes in tax laws could make home ownership less attractive, reducing the demand for residential mortgage loans. Additionally, in many respects, the traditional mortgage origination business is relationship based, and dependent on the services of individual mortgage loan officers. The loss of services of one or more loan officers could have the effect of reducing the level of our mortgage production, or the rate of growth of production. As a result of these factors we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to maintain or increase the volume or percentage of revenue or net income produced by the residential mortgage business.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if we are required to repurchase loans originated for sale by our Residential Lending department.\nThe Bank originates residential mortgage loans for sale to secondary market investors, subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions. Because the loans are intended to be originated within investor guidelines, using designated automated underwriting and product specific requirements as part of the loan application, the loans sold have a limited recourse provision. In general, the Bank may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the investor if there is non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards including fraud, negligence, material misstatement in the loan documents or non-compliance with applicable law. In addition, the Bank may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term or return profits made should the loan prepay within a short period. The potential mortgagor early default repurchase period is up to approximately twelve months after sale of the loan to the investor. The recourse period for fraud, material misstatement, breach of representations and warranties, non-compliance with law, or similar matters could be as long as the term of the loan. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single family residential properties, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, or have private mortgage insurance. Our experience to date has been minimal in the case of loan repurchases due to default, fraud, breach of representations, material misstatement, or legal non-compliance. While not a significant matter in the past, should repurchases become a material issue, our earnings and asset quality could be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact our share price.\nOur financial condition, earnings and asset quality could be adversely affected if our consumer facing operations do not operate in compliance with applicable regulations.\nWhile all aspects of our operations are subject to detailed and complex compliance regimes, those portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers pose particular challenges given the emphasis on consumer compliance by bank regulators at all levels. Residential mortgage lending raises significant compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage lending regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent operating environment in which mortgage lending officers operate. As a result, despite the education, compliance training, supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, individual loan officers intentionally trying to conceal improper activities could result in the Bank being strictly liable for restitution or damages to individual borrowers, and to regulatory enforcement activity.\nChanges in interest rates and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results.\nOur operating income and net income depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, i.e., the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans, securities and other interest bearing assets and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing deposits and other liabilities. Net interest margin is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, re-pricing, and balances of the different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. At December 31, 2021, our cumulative net asset sensitive twelve month gap position was +0.9% of total assets. As such, we expect modest increases of approximately +4.7% and +8.1%, respectively, in projected net interest income and net income over a twelve month period resulting from a 100 basis point increase in rates. In addition, our residential mortgage origination and sale volume could decline if interest rates increase. The results of our interest rate sensitivity simulation model depend upon a number of assumptions, which may not prove to be accurate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk.\nAdverse changes in the real estate market in our market area could also have an adverse effect on our cost of funds and net interest margin, as we have a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits related to real estate sales and development. While we expect that we would be able to replace the liquidity provided by these deposits, the replacement funds would likely be more costly, negatively impacting earnings.\nFluctuations in inflation rates may also have a number of adverse effects on the Bank and the Company. For example, material increases in inflation rates would likely result in an increase in personnel and other operational costs and an increase in salary and wage expenses, which comprise the Bank\u2019s most significant non-interest expense category. Long periods of high inflation also result in higher interest rates, which will increase the Bank\u2019s deposit costs and overall cost of funds. Higher interest rates will also reduce the value of the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio holdings, and if such reductions are significant, they may materially limit our ability to meet future liquidity shortfalls by selling investments without realizing substantial losses. These and other indirect impacts of inflation on the Bank and the Company could significantly adversely affect the Bank's and the Company's earnings and capital in both the short term and long term.\nUncertainty relating to the discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, be used as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and is monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks.\nThe inability to obtain LIBOR rates, and the uncertainty as to the nature, comparability and utility of alternative reference rates which have been or may be established may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-based loans, investment securities and other financial instruments in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and the Bank is required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under its loan agreements, it may incur additional expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, the establishment of alternative reference rates, or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets, us or our fixed-to-floating rate debt securities. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our fixed-to-floating rate debt securities. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest payable on our outstanding fixed-to-floating rate debt securities to be materially different, and potentially higher, than expected.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete with others for business.\nThe Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which we operate is considered highly attractive from an economic and demographic viewpoint, and is a highly competitive banking market. We compete for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks, online divisions of out-of-market banks, and other community banking institutions, as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, private lenders and nontraditional competitors such as fintech companies and internet-based lenders, depositories and payment systems. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with traditional and new financial services providers, some of which maintain a physical presence in our market areas\nand others of which maintain only a virtual presence. Many competitors have substantially greater resources than us, and some operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The differences in resources and regulations may make it harder for us to compete profitably, reduce the rates that we can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates we must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect our overall financial condition and earnings.\nThe Bank has been very successful in developing customer relationships. Going forward, should competitive pressures increase, we are subject to the risk that we may not be able to retain the loans and deposits produced by these new relationships. While we believe that our relationship banking model will enable us to keep a significant percentage of these new relationships, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, that we would be able to maintain favorable pricing, margins and asset quality, or that we will be able to grow at the same rate we did when alternative financing was not widely available.\nOur customers, and businesses in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in general, may be adversely impacted as a result of changes in government spending.\nThe Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is characterized by a significant number of businesses that are federal government contractors or subcontractors, or which depend on such businesses for a significant portion of their revenues. While the Company does not have a significant level of loans to federal government contractors or their subcontractors, the impact of a shutdown of federal government operations, a decline in federal government spending, a reallocation of government spending to different industries or different areas of the country, or a delay in payments to such contractors, could have a ripple effect. In particular, the federal government\u2019s response to COVID-19 has been to provide stimulus to the economy through the PPP, direct payments to taxpayers, and other programs. These programs were generally successful in stabilizing the economy throughout the pandemic. However, as the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S economy recedes and America gets back to work, these stimulus programs are not expected to be continued. The effect of the discontinuance of COVID-19-related stimulus on the local economy in 2022 and beyond is uncertain. Temporary layoffs, staffing freezes, salary reductions or furloughs of government employees or government contractors, and other impacts from the cessation of stimulus or declining government spending, could have adverse impacts on other businesses in the Company\u2019s market and the general economy of the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and may indirectly lead to a loss of revenues by the Company\u2019s customers, including vendors and lessors to the federal government and government contractors or to their employees, as well as a wide variety of commercial and retail businesses. Accordingly, such potential federal government actions could lead to increases in past due loans, nonperforming loans, credit loss reserves, and charge-offs, and a decline in liquidity.\nWe rely upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate that secures a significant portion of our loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if we are forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. We rely upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment, which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of our loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, we may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and will suffer a loss.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business we lend against, and from time to time foreclose and take title to, real estate, potentially becoming subject to environmental liabilities associated with the properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and cleanup costs or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. Costs associated with investigation or remediation activities can be substantial. If the Bank is the lender to, or owner or former owner of, a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations rely significantly on certain external vendors.\nOur business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. Our operations are exposed to risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in our agreements for any number of reasons including equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures\nin place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of our operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTING IN OUR STOCK\nOur ability to make distributions in respect of our securities may be limited.\nOur ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock, to repurchase shares of our common stock, or to pay interest on our subordinated debt will depend largely upon the ability of the Bank, the Company\u2019s principal operating business, to declare and pay dividends to the Company. Payment of distributions on our securities will also depend upon the Bank\u2019s earnings, financial condition, and need for funds, as well as laws, regulations and governmental policies applicable to the Company and the Bank, which limit the amount of distributions that may be made. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank each must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends and repurchasing shares. The payment of dividends in any period, and the adoption or implementation of a share repurchase program, do not mean that the Company will continue to pay dividends at the current level, or at all, or that it will repurchase any additional shares of common stock. Refer to \u201cRegulation\u201d under Item 1 and to \u201cMarket for Common Stock\u201d under Item 5 for additional information.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions, which could affect the priority of our common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn accordance with our Amended Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors may determine from time to time that we need to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of our common stock or other securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be effected. Such offerings could be dilutive to common shareholders. Pursuant to our Amended Articles of Incorporation, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock, on such terms and with such powers, preferences, rights and provisions as it may determine, and to divide the preferred stock into one or more classes or series. New investors, and particularly investors in any preferred stock the Company may issue from time to time, will therefore have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then current common shareholders. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, upon liquidation of the Company, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nSubstantial regulatory limitations on changes of control and anti-takeover provisions of Maryland law may make it more difficult for shareholders to receive a change in control premium.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquiror is a bank holding company) of any class of the Company\u2019s voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of its directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of the Company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. There are comparable prior approval requirements for changes in control under Maryland law. Also, the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended, contains several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company without the approval of its Board of Directors, and may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of its outstanding common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nBecause we have over $10 billion in total assets on our balance sheet, the Company is subject to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased costs in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total assets were $11.8 billion. In addition to our current regulatory requirements, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are examined directly by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer protection laws, and are subject to enhanced prudential regulation, continuous ongoing supervision by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC\nand additional regulatory requirements. The Company and the Bank expect to be subject to ongoing supervision by the Federal Reserve and FDIC (as opposed to discrete examinations as a community banking organization), targeted examinations, more frequent loan portfolio reviews, and other enhanced supervision. The Bank will also need to provide information to the CFPB on a quarterly basis, and will be subject to periodic examinations focused on compliance with consumer laws and regulations, as a banking organization with over $10 billion in total assets. Compliance with these additional ongoing requirements may necessitate additional personnel, the design and implementation of additional internal controls, or the incurrence of significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur concentrations of loans may require us to maintain higher levels of capital.\nUnder guidance adopted by the federal banking agencies, banks which have concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans (other than loans for majority owner occupied properties) would be expected to maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital. Although not currently anticipated, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our levels of construction, development and commercial real estate loans.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, possibly including enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are named as a defendant in various legal actions arising in connection with our current and/or prior business activities or public disclosures. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Further, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. We are also, from time to time, the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by various agencies and other bodies regarding our current and/or prior business activities. Additionally, we also from time to time receive demand letters from shareholders, and such letters may lead to these shareholders filing claims or derivative suits against us if our engagement with such shareholders ends in a failure to successfully negotiate a settlement. The Company has received various document requests and subpoenas from securities and banking regulators and U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in connection with investigations, which the Company believes relate to the Company's identification, classification and disclosure of related party transactions; the retirement of certain former officers and directors; and the relationship of the Company and certain of its former officers and directors with a local public official, among other things. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices, required changes in our senior officers, or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our business. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise, and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, regulatory order or agreement, informal enforcement action, or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in adverse audit findings, or additional litigation, investigations or proceedings as other parties, including other litigants and/or government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, including in any particular reporting period.\nFurther, in such matters, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to estimate the amount of any reasonably possible loss. We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine, penalty or other relief, conditions or restrictions, if any, may be, particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation. We may be required to pay fines or civil money penalties, or make other payments in connection with certain of these issues. This uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which, in turn, can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements, fines, or penalties. While the Company and Bank carry insurance to protect us from material outlays (excluding regulatory fees and penalties), such insurance may not always fully or even substantially cover such outlays. The Company maintains director and officer insurance policies (\u201cD&O Insurance Policies\u201d) that provide coverage for the legal defense costs related to certain of the above-referenced investigations and litigations. Subject to any new developments to any new or existing investigations and litigations that may occur over the next few months, the Company currently believes there is a possibility that the applicable D&O Insurance Policies may be exhausted as early as the first quarter of 2022. Once the D&O Insurance Policies are exhausted, the Company will be responsible for paying the defense costs associated with those investigations and litigations for itself and on behalf of any current and former officers and directors entitled to indemnification from the Company. The Company cannot predict with any certainty the amount of defense costs that the Company may incur in the future in connection with currently ongoing and any potential future investigations and legal proceedings, as they are dependent on various factors, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. In the event such costs are significant, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have a materially adverse effect on our operations.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated and supervised under federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, the public, the banking system as a whole or the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, not for the protection of our shareholders and creditors. The Company and Bank are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, as well as our state regulator. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. The laws and regulations applicable to the Company and Bank govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments they may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves that must hold against deposits, the types of deposits that may be accepted and the rates that may be paid on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in control of the Company and Bank, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, handling of nonpublic information, restrictions on distributions to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, dividends and establishment of new offices. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there is risk that such approvals may not be granted, either in a timely manner or at all. These requirements may constrain our operations, and the adoption of new laws and changes to or repeal of existing laws may have a further impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, the burden imposed by those laws and regulations may place banks in general, including the Bank in particular, at a competitive disadvantage compared to its non-bank competitors. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApplicable federal and state laws, regulations, interpretations, enforcement policies and accounting principles have been subject to significant changes in recent years, and may be subject to significant future changes. Future changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Federal regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or effect of future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulations to us. Compliance with current and potential regulation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring it to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance and respond to any regulatory inquiries or investigations.\nIn addition, regulators may elect to alter standards or the interpretation of the standards used to measure regulatory compliance or to determine the adequacy of liquidity, risk management or other operational practices for financial service companies in a manner that impacts our ability to implement our strategy and could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies have extremely broad discretion in their interpretation of laws and regulations and their assessment of the quality of our loan portfolio, securities portfolio and other assets. If any regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of the quality of our assets, operations, lending practices, investment practices, capital structure or other aspects of our business differs from our assessment, we may be required to take additional charges or undertake, or refrain from taking, actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information, and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential, or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information, or PII, in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third party service providers. We also maintain important internal company data such as PII about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of PII of individuals (including customers, employees and other third parties), as well as planning for responding to data security breaches. Various federal and state banking regulators and states have also enacted data breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer, storage and disposal of PII complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that customers and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to\nlitigation or regulatory sanctions under privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard PII, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING AND TAXATION\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Testing for impairment of goodwill is performed annually and involves the identification of the reporting unit and the estimation of fair value. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.\nChanges in tax laws could have an adverse effect on us, the banking industry, our customers, the value of collateral securing our loans and demand for loans.\nWe are subject to the effect of changes in tax laws which could increase the effective tax rate payable by us to federal and state governments, reduce the value of our beneficial tax attributes or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws could have a negative impact on the banking industry, borrowers, the market for single family residential or commercial real estate, or business borrowing. To the extent that changes in law discourage borrowing, ownership of real property or business investment, such changes may have an adverse effect on the demand for our loans. Further, the value of the properties securing loans in our portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of real estate ownership and borrowing, which could require an increase in our ACL, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain borrowers could become less able to service their debts as a result of changes in taxation. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Any such changes (while not anticipated) could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and Bank\u2019s capital, regulatory capital ratios, ability to make larger loans, earnings and performance metrics.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has issued the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard, which became applicable to us on January 1, 2020. CECL requires financial institutions to estimate and establish a provision for credit losses over the lifetime of the asset, at the origination or acquisition of the asset, as opposed to reserving for probable incurred losses. The CECL model also applies to certain financial assets other than loans, including debt securities. Under the CECL standard, expected credit deterioration would be reflected in the income statement in the period of origination or acquisition of an asset, with changes in expected credit losses due to further credit deterioration or improvement reflected in the periods in which the expectation changes. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Accordingly, the CECL model could require financial institutions, like the Bank, to increase their allowances for credit losses. We elected the Federal Reserve and FDIC\u2019s rule providing for an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard. If we need to make significant and unanticipated increases in our loss allowance in the future, our business, results of operations, capital and financial condition could be materially adversely affected at that time.\nThe implementation of the CECL model involves the use of estimates and forecasts based on difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including estimates as to the direction and effects of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of assets. To the extent that our analysis of our prior loss experience, current and forecast economic conditions, and other factors included in our estimates of expected loss are incorrect, our ACL may be inadequate. Additionally, to the extent that economic conditions and forecasts and prior loss experience have been favorable, rapid or unforeseen changes in economic conditions or performance of our loans and other financial assets could result in our ACL being inadequate, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our judgments about our historical loss experience, categorization of loans and other assets and forecasts of economic conditions and other factors that will impact the expected losses on an asset will be correct.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY\nOur operations, including our transactions with customers, are increasingly conducted via electronic means, and this has increased risks related to cybersecurity.\nWe are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In addition, we are exposed to cyber-attacks on vendors and merchants that affect us and our customers. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We have observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. To combat against these attacks, policies and procedures are in place to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from the possible security breach of its information systems and cyber-fraud. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. While we have not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information, and repairing system damage that may have been caused; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; disruption or failures of physical infrastructure, operating systems or networks that support our business and customers resulting in the loss of customers and business opportunities; additional regulatory scrutiny and possible regulatory penalties; litigation; and, reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nA breach or interruption of information security or cyber-related threats could negatively affect our earnings.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, adversely affect customer or investor confidence, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible regulatory penalties, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In November 2021, three federal banking agencies (OCC, FRB, FDIC) approved a final rule that will require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of any significant computer security event that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the viability of the organization\u2019s banking operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. This rule also covers service providers when the provider determines that it has experienced such a computer-security incident. This notification must be made no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred. This new rule will become effective on April 1, 2022, with a compliance date of May 1, 2022. The Company is currently establishing internal processes to ensure compliance with this rule. certain criteria. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposal on our operations.\nFailure to keep up with the rapid technological changes in the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and profitability.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services effectively or be successful in marketing these products and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm our ability to compete effectively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive, which may increase our overall expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the use of data and modeling in both management\u2019s decision-making, generally, and in meeting regulatory expectations, in particular.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitatively-based analyses is endemic to bank decision-making and regulatory compliance processes, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, allowance for credit loss measurement, portfolio stress testing, assessing capital adequacy and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. We anticipate that model-derived insights will be used more widely in decision-making in the future. While these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data, flawed quantitative approaches or poorly designed or implemented models could yield adverse or faulty outcomes and decisions, and could result in regulatory scrutiny. Secondarily, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock at a time or price they find attractive.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to those described in \u201cCaution About Forward Looking Statements,\u201d these factors include:\n\u2022Actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022Changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u2022Reports in the press, internet, or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or the financial services industry, whether or not those reports are based on accurate, complete or transparent information;\n\u2022Uncertainties related to our regulatory relationships or status;\n\u2022Strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u2022Fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022Future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022Proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022Domestic and international economic and political factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022Actions of one or more investors in selling our common stock short; and\n\u2022General market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry (inclusive of the potential adverse impact by current or anticipated military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events).\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the market prices for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87318, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EGBN"}
