{"cik": "1001385", "company": "NORTHWEST PIPE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, together with all the other information included in this 2016 Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. As such, you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur Water Transmission business faces an overcapacity situation due to recent capacity expansions as well as the potential for increased competition from substitute products from manufacturers of concrete, ductile iron, polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d) and high density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d) pipe. Orders in the Water Transmission business are competitively bid and price competition can be vigorous. In a market that already has overcapacity issues, the recent increases in capacity have negatively affected our sales, gross margins and overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, ability to meet customized specifications and high freight costs. Although our Water Transmission manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, Utah and Mexico allow us to compete throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, we cannot assure you that new or existing competitors will not establish new facilities or expand capacity further within our market areas. In February 2017, a competitor announced it was building a new spiral-welded steel pipe mill in California. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our market share, product pricing, sales, gross margins and overall profitability in our Water Transmission business.\nWater transmission pipe is manufactured generally from steel, concrete, ductile iron, PVC or HDPE. Each pipe material has advantages and disadvantages. Steel and concrete are more common materials for larger diameter water transmission pipelines because ductile iron pipe generally is limited in diameter due to the manufacturing process. The public agencies and engineers who determine the specifications for water transmission projects analyze these pipe materials for suitability for each project. Individual project circumstances normally dictate the preferred material. If we experience cost increases in raw materials, labor and overhead specific to our industry or the location of our facilities, while competing products or companies do not experience similar changes, we could experience an adverse change in the demand, price and profitability of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nA downturn in government spending related to public water transmission projects would adversely affect our business. Our Water Transmission business accounted for approximately 96% of our Net sales in 2016. Our Water Transmission business is primarily dependent upon spending on public water transmission projects, including water infrastructure upgrades, repairs and replacement and new water infrastructure spending, which, in turn, depends on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe need for new or replacement infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe priorities placed on various projects by governmental entities;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local government spending levels, including budgetary constraints related to capital projects and the ability to obtain financing; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of governmental entities to obtain environmental approvals, right-of-way permits and other required approvals and permits.\nDecreases in the number of, or government funding of, public water transmission projects would adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nProject delays in public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business. The public water agencies constructing water transmission projects generally announce the projects well in advance of the bidding and construction process. It is not unusual for projects to be delayed and rescheduled. Projects are delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons, including changes in project priorities, difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations, changes in ability to obtain adequate project funding and additional time required to acquire rights-of-way or property rights. Delays in public water transmission projects may occur with insufficient notice to allow us to replace those projects in our manufacturing schedules. As a result, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected by unplanned downtime.\nFluctuations in steel prices may affect our future results of operations. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature, and at times, pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, import duties, other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates. Over the past three years, steel prices have fluctuated significantly. Our cost for a ton of steel from continuing operations was approximately $474 per ton in 2016, $573 per ton in 2015 and $746 per ton in 2014. In 2016, our monthly average steel purchasing costs ranged from a high of approximately $610 per ton to a low of approximately $413 per ton. This volatility can significantly affect our gross profit. Although we seek to recover increases in steel prices through price increases in our products, we have not always been successful. Any increase in steel prices that is not offset by an increase in our prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur Water Transmission backlog is subject to reduction and cancelation. Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed to purchase from us and projects for which we have been notified that we are the successful bidder even though a binding agreement has not been executed. Projects for which a binding contract has not been executed could be canceled. Our backlog of orders for our Water Transmission business was approximately $66 million as of December 31, 2016. Our backlog is subject to fluctuations; moreover, cancelations of purchase orders, change orders on contracts or reductions of product quantities could materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, future revenues. Our failure to replace canceled or reduced backlog could result in lower revenues, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to develop or successfully market new products or our products might not obtain necessary approvals or achieve market acceptance, which could adversely affect our growth. We will continue to actively seek to develop new products and to expand our existing products into new markets, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing new products, expanding into new markets, or we do not obtain or maintain requisite approvals for our products, the demand for our products could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe success of our business is affected by general economic conditions, and our business may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown or recession. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States, or the public perception that one may occur, have and could further decrease the demand for our products, affect the price of our products and adversely impact our business. We have been impacted in the past by the general slowing of the economy, and the economic slowdown has had an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOperating problems in our business could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our manufacturing operations are subject to typical hazards and risks relating to the manufacture of similar products such as:\n\u2022\nexplosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\nunscheduled downtime;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\nloss of process control and quality;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to supply;\n\u2022\nraw materials quality defects;\n\u2022\nservice provider delays or failures;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays or failures;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain or maintain required licenses or permits; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards such as chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases into the environment or workplace.\nThe occurrence of any of these operating problems at our facilities may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our operations as a whole, during and after the period of these operating difficulties. These operating problems may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. In addition, individuals could seek damages for alleged personal injury or property damage. Furthermore, we could be subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace injury, exposure to hazardous materials, workers\u2019 compensation and other matters. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for our industries, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liability that may be ultimately incurred or that such coverage will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims that result in liability exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur quarterly results of operations are subject to significant fluctuation. Our net sales and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nunplanned down time due to project delays or mechanical failure;\n\u2022\nunderutilized capacity or factory productivity;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the cost of steel and other raw materials; and\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures.\nResults of operations in any period are not indicative of results for any future period, and comparisons between any two periods may not be meaningful.\nWe face risks in connection with potential acquisitions and divestitures. Acquiring businesses that expand and/or complement our operations has been an important element of our business strategy, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that may expand and/or complement our business. We may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate favorable terms in the future. Furthermore, our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on, among other things, the adequacy of our implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies. We may also consider other alternatives for our business units in order to strategically position our business and continue to compete in our markets, which may include joint-ventures and/or divestitures. Our failure to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses that we may acquire in the future or our inability to attract a business partner in which to enter into a joint-venture or a buyer willing to purchase our business units (including our remaining Tubular Products business, for which we are exploring a divestiture) may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims for damages for defective products, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We warrant our products to be free of certain defects. We have, from time to time, had claims alleging defects in our products. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. While we currently have product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that may be incurred in the future or that such coverage will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liabilities exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to recover costs and damages from vendors that supply defective materials. We may receive defective materials from our vendors that are incorporated into our products during the manufacturing process. The cost to repair, remake or replace defective products could be greater than the amount that can be recovered from the vendor. Such excess costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have a foreign operation which exposes us to the risks of doing business abroad. Our facility in Monterrey, Mexico primarily exports products to the United States. We may operate in additional countries in the future. Any material changes in the quotas, regulations or duties on imports imposed by the United States government and our agencies or on exports imposed by these foreign governments and their agencies could adversely affect our foreign operations.\nWe also sell some of our products internationally. Our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in a foreign country, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022\ngovernment embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nNo assurance can be given that our operations may not be adversely affected in the future. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products and services, decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or increasing costs such that there would be an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We cannot assure you that we will continue to operate in compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject, or that any such regulations or laws will not be modified. Any failure by us to comply with any such applicable regulations or laws, or any changes in any such regulations or laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting includes estimates. Revenue from construction contracts in our Water Transmission business is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total costs of each contract (the cost-to-cost method). Estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all active projects. All cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by more than two percent are reviewed by senior management personnel.\nThe estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining income earned and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known. Due to the variability of events affecting our estimates which have a material impact on our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental and health and safety laws, which may require us to incur substantial compliance and remediation costs, thereby reducing our profits. We are subject to many federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the use, handling, treatment, storage, discharge and disposal of substances and hazardous wastes used or generated in our manufacturing processes. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, required to incur costs relating to the environmental assessment or environmental remediation of our property, and for addressing environmental conditions, including, but not limited to, the issues associated with our Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas facilities as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II - Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this 2016 Form 10-K. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Consequently, we cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances, the development of new facts or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require significant expenditures by us.\nWe expect to continue to be subject to increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. It is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on our future earnings and operations. We anticipate that compliance will continue to require capital expenditures and operating costs. Any increase in these costs, or unanticipated liabilities arising, for example, out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or more aggressive enforcement actions, could adversely affect our results of operations, and there is no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased levels of imports have and could continue to adversely affect pricing and demand for our products. We believe import levels are affected by, among other things, overall worldwide demand, lower cost of production in other countries, the trade practices of foreign governments, government subsidies to foreign producers and governmentally imposed trade restrictions in the United States. The level of imports of tubular products has historically impacted the domestic tubular products market and reduced the demand for our tubular products, a situation we expect to continue. While imported pipe has historically most affected our Tubular Products business, imported pipe could have a greater effect on our Water Transmission business in the future. Additionally, high levels of imported tubular products have led at least one domestic manufacturer of tubular products to recently enter the water transmission market, and other tubular products manufacturers could do the same in the future. Increased imports in the United States and Canada which compete with our Water Transmission products could reduce demand for our products in the future and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur information technology systems can be negatively affected by cyber security threats. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary, employee and other key information and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nOur plan to explore the sale of our remaining Tubular Products business may not result in a transaction or a transaction may cause us to recognize a loss. We are exploring the sale of our remaining Tubular Products business to focus on our core Water Transmission business. The process to explore this sale is subject to a number of uncertainties, some of which are not in our control. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the process will result in a transaction or, if it does, that it would occur within any specified period of time or under what terms. Our evaluation of potential transactions may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nIn addition, the fact that we are exploring the sale of our Tubular Products business may damage our relationship with that business\u2019 customers, suppliers, employees and other business partners, which may result in a reduction of net sales and market position that we may not be able to regain if we are unable to successfully complete a transaction.\nEven if the process results in a transaction, we cannot predict how the market price for our common stock would be affected by the announcement of a transaction. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be highly volatile during the period in which we explore the sale and may continue to be more volatile if and when a transaction is announced or if we announce that we are no longer exploring a sale.\nAny eventual sale of the Tubular Products business is subject to negotiation of a final agreement and a negotiated transaction price could be below the current carrying value of Tubular Products\u2019 net assets. This could result in recognition of a material loss on the disposition of that business which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur Tubular Products business faces difficult market conditions. Our Tubular Products business is exposed to the energy markets. Our line pipe products, which serve the energy market, comprise 65%, 58% and 77% of our tons sold in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for our continuing operations in the Tubular Products Group. Sales of these products are tied to the exploration, development and production of natural gas and oil reserves. Decreasing oil prices, particularly since late 2014, have resulted in weaker demand for our line pipe products. Additionally, the market for our tubular products is over-supplied, driven by high levels of imported product and increased domestic capacity and production in the United States and Canada. The Atchison, Kansas facility operated at reduced levels from April 2015 to January 2016, when we idled the facility to reduce operating expenses until market conditions improve or a sale is completed. A protracted weak market for our tubular products could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur Tubular Products business has incurred past operating losses, and could generate operating losses for an extended period. The Tubular Products business has incurred operating losses in the past, and is likely to do so until the Atchison, Kansas facility is either restarted or sold. Some fixed costs will continue to be incurred while the plant is idled, generating ongoing operating losses. An accumulation of operating losses could result in an impairment of our Tubular Products assets or a loss on the sale of those assets. If the Atchison facility remains idle for an extended period, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe will need to substantially increase working capital if market conditions and customer order levels improve. If market conditions and customer order levels improve, we will have to increase our working capital substantially, as it will take several months for new orders to be translated into cash receipts. In general, borrowings under our Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A. are limited to the lesser of $60 million or availability under a borrowing base, which is subject to various sublimits and borrowing restrictions as determined under our Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we had $13.0 million available to borrow under our Agreement. We may not have sufficient availability under our Agreement to borrow the amounts we need, and other opportunities to borrow additional funds or raise capital in the equity markets may be limited or nonexistent. A shortage in the availability of working capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe restrictions under which we operate as a result of our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have financed our operations through cash flows from operations, available borrowings and other financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $0.9 million of capital lease obligations and no outstanding borrowings on our line of credit. However, we could incur borrowings on our line of credit in the future to finance increases in working capital, fund capital expenditures, fund negative operating cash flows or for other corporate purposes. These borrowings could become significant in the future.\nOur current and future debt and debt service obligations could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes in the future;\n\u2022\nreduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations, capital expenditures and other activities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns, illiquid capital markets and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to our borrowings that bear interest at variable rates, cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our current and future debt will depend on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, prevailing interest rate levels and other financial, competitive and business factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt or any of the foregoing factors would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur failure to comply with covenants in our debt agreements could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The agreements governing our current and future debt include covenants that impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations and general business activities. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional debt and to create liens or other encumbrances on assets, and our ability to experience material adverse events.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments in the future is uncertain and will be affected by our results of operations and financial condition as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control. If market and other economic conditions do not improve, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the requirements of these covenants, if not waived or cured, could permit acceleration of the related debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient assets to repay such debt or that we would be able to refinance such debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The acceleration of a significant portion of our debt would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the financial markets and a general economic slowdown could cause us to be unable to obtain financing and expose us to risks related to the overall macro-economic environment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The United States equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many equities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing, even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing. These events may make it less likely that we will be able to obtain additional financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nRisks Related to Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have identified material weaknesses in internal control in prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2014 a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to goodwill was identified. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim Consolidated Financial Statements would not be prevented or detected. This material weakness was remediated as of September 30, 2015.\nNo material weaknesses were identified as of December 31, 2016 or 2015. However, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe relatively low trading volume of our common stock may limit your ability to sell your shares. Although our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), we have historically experienced a relatively low trading volume. If we have a low trading volume in the future, holders of our shares may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that might otherwise be attainable.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per share, net income and net sales;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nloss of any member of our senior management team;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructuring;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022\nrelatively low trading volume;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and market expectations for our industry and the financial health of our customers; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced broad fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our governing documents and Oregon law could discourage potential acquisition proposals. Our articles of incorporation contain provisions that:\n\u2022\nclassify the board of directors into three classes, each of which serves for a three-year term with one class elected each year;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed by shareholders only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, fix the number of shares constituting any such series and determine the voting powers and all other rights and preferences of any such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nIn addition, we are subject to the Oregon Business Combination Act, which imposes certain restrictions on business combination transactions and may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors. We also have a shareholder rights plan that acts to discourage any person or group from making a tender offer for, or acquiring, more than 15% of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. Any of these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals, could deter, delay or prevent a change in control that our shareholders consider favorable and could depress the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 82599, "SIC": 3317, "TIC": "NWPX"}
