RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business. They are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur financial results are difficult to predict, and if we fail to meet our financial guidance or the expectations of investors, potential investors and/or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock will likely decline significantly.\nOur financial results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate. These fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our customers\u2019 capital spending, industry cyclicality (particularly in the semiconductor equipment industry), market seasonality (particularly in the scientific research market), levels of government funding available to our customers (particularly in the scientific research, defense and life and health sciences markets) and other economic conditions within the markets we serve;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and the products sold by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe level of orders within a given quarter and preceding quarters;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders in backlog for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product shipments and revenue recognition within a given quarter;\n\u2022\nvariations in the mix of products we sell;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing practices or in the pricing practices of our competitors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nour timing in introducing new products;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product introductions by our competitors;\n\u2022\ntiming and level of scrap and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\nthe availability, quality and cost of components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage capacity in response to customer demand;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, including cash, marketable securities and debt balances, and changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in bad debt expense based on the collectability of our accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ntiming, type, and size of acquisitions and divestitures, and related expenses and charges;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro and Japanese yen as compared with the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\ngains and losses related to derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nour expense levels;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nfees, expenses and settlement costs or judgments against us relating to litigation.\nWe are continually evaluating and adjusting our business, including changing prices, increasing or decreasing spending, or adding or eliminating products in response to actions by competitors or in an effort to pursue new market opportunities. These actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our results in a given period to be lower than our results in previous periods.\nFurther, we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of the quarter. Thus, variations in timing of sales, particularly for our higher-priced, higher-margin products, can cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales, gross margin and profitability. Orders expected to ship in one period could shift to another period due to changes in the timing of customers\u2019 purchase decisions, rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers, or manufacturing capacity constraints or logistics delays. Our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers, particularly our largest customers, cancel or reschedule orders, or if we cannot fill orders in time due to capacity constraints or unexpected delays in manufacturing, testing, shipping and product acceptance. Also, we base our manufacturing plans on our forecasted product mix for the quarter. If the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast, we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter, which would result in delays in the shipment of our products and could shift sales to a subsequent period. In addition, our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales, and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our limited ability to adjust spending quickly to compensate for the shortfall.\nDue to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations, or any other similar period-to-period comparisons, may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In any period, our results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nDecreased consumer confidence, volatile corporate operating results, reduced capital spending, lower research and defense budgets, and the effects of reduced availability of credit, have in the recent past led to reduced demand and increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, and could do so in the future. Weakness in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue, gross margin and operating margin, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur worldwide sales to customers in the scientific research, defense and life and health sciences markets rely to a large extent on government funding for research and defense-related programs. Any decline in government funding as a result of reduced budgets in connection with fiscal austerity measures or other causes would likely result in reduced sales of our products that are purchased either directly or indirectly with government funding, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, uncertainty in government fiscal policy may have a similar adverse impact on the demand for our products. For example, the difficulties faced by the U.S. Congress in recent years in agreeing on comprehensive, long-term solutions for the country\u2019s budget concerns created national and global uncertainty over the magnitude and impact of spending cuts or tax increases that might be enacted. Any future spending cuts or tax increases in the United States, and any future uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy, will likely negatively impact U.S. economic activity as a whole, which would likely reduce the demand for our products in the United States. In addition, such factors could also impact the economic health of other regions and reduce the demand for our products in our other global markets.\nFurther, we are dependent upon the European market as a significant revenue source. In the event the economies of European Union countries decline further as a result of ongoing turmoil in the European financial markets over the uncertain repayment of debt obligations by various European Union members, or for any other reason, this decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOngoing concerns regarding the global availability of credit also may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their projects and purchases of capital equipment. Delays in our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, could adversely affect sales of our products and systems, particularly high-value lasers and systems, and therefore harm our business and operating results.\nWe face significant risks from doing business internationally.\nOur business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally. For the years ended January 3, 2015, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, our international revenues accounted for approximately 61.9%, 61.0%, and 59.1%, respectively, of total net sales, with a substantial portion of such sales originating in Europe, Japan and China. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to Asian customers will continue to increase. Additionally, we have substantial international manufacturing, sales and administrative operations, with significant facilities and employee populations in Austria, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan and Romania. Our international operations expose us to various risks, which include:\n\u2022\nadverse changes or instability in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products;\n\u2022\nchallenges of administering our diverse business and product lines globally;\n\u2022\nthe actions of government regulatory authorities, including embargoes, export restrictions, tariffs, currency controls, trade restrictions and trade barriers, license requirements, environmental and other regulatory requirements and other rules and regulations applicable to the manufacture, import and export of our products, all of which are complicated and potentially conflicting, often require significant investments in cost, time and resources for compliance, and may impose strict and severe penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of violations of anti-corruption laws by our employees, sales representatives, distributors or other agents;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection periods;\n\u2022\noverlapping, differing or more burdensome tax structures;\n\u2022\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nreduced or inconsistent protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmore complex and burdensome labor laws and practices in countries where we have employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual international operations; and\n\u2022\nincreased risk of exposure to civil unrest, terrorist and military activities.\nIn particular, we have significant facilities and operations and a considerable number of employees in Israel. A number of our products are manufactured in facilities located in Israel. The Middle East remains a volatile region, and the future of peace efforts between Israel and neighboring countries remains extremely uncertain. Any armed conflicts or significant political instability in the region is likely to negatively affect business conditions and could significantly disrupt our operations in Israel, which would negatively impact our business. Further, many of our employees in Israel are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. If a military conflict or war arises, these individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time, and our operations in Israel could be disrupted by the absence of one or more key employees or a significant number of other employees for a significant period of time. Any such disruption could adversely affect our business.\nFurther, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could result in declining profit margins for our products in international markets when the sales are translated into U.S. dollars, unless we act to increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in these markets, potentially making our products less price competitive. Such exchange rate fluctuations could also increase the costs and expenses of our non-U.S. operations when translated into U.S. dollars or require us to modify our current business practices. If we experience any of the risks associated with international business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nWe are dependent in part on the semiconductor capital equipment market, which is volatile and unpredictable.\nA significant portion of our current and expected future business comes from sales of products and subsystems to manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication, inspection and metrology equipment. The semiconductor capital equipment market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand. The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict, and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles. For example, this market experienced a severe down-cycle from mid-year 2007 to mid-year 2009 and again from mid-2011 to late 2013, which in each case had a significant negative impact on our operating results. The continued cyclicality of this market limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market.\nDuring industry downturns, our revenues from this market may decline suddenly and significantly. Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next-generation product technology and to support and service our products. In addition, due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the products and subsystems we sell to this market, we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell. Accordingly, downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Conversely, when upturns in this market occur, we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our manufacturing capacity to meet sudden increases in customer demand. If we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed.\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our overall sales to the microelectronics market and our sales of optics and lens assemblies to the defense market, and if we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail their purchases of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed significantly.\nOur sales to the microelectronics market (which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment customers) constituted 25.4%, 23.4% and 23.3% of our consolidated net sales for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales to this market. Our top five customers in this market comprised approximately 60.7%, 55.5% and 53.4% of our sales to this market for the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, with two customers making up a substantial portion of such percentage in each of these years. No single customer in this market comprised 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in 2014, 2013 or 2012. If any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us, replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business, our business and results of operations would be harmed significantly. In addition, because a relatively small number of companies dominate the semiconductor equipment portion of this market, and because those companies rarely change vendors in the middle of a product\u2019s life cycle, it may be particularly difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business.\nThe microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets, their products and components may not achieve, or continue to achieve, anticipated levels of market acceptance. If our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance, it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products. We often invest substantial resources in developing our products and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these products and subsystems to such customers. A failure on the part of our customers\u2019 products to gain market acceptance, or a failure of the microelectronics market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales of infrared optics and lens assemblies to a limited number of customers in the defense market. Typically, these customers purchase products utilizing prime contracts or subcontracts under large, long-term government defense programs. Although long-term, these programs and subcontracts will ultimately expire or may be terminated prior to expiration under certain circumstances. Upon expiration or termination, our customers may not elect to enter into additional contracts with us, or the government programs under which these contracts were issued may also end. In the event that any of these contracts terminates or expires and is not renewed and we fail to replace it with a comparable revenue source, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed significantly.\nDifficulties in finding suitable acquisition targets and in successfully completing and integrating our acquisitions could harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have acquired and will continue to acquire businesses, and our ability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, complete acquisitions on acceptable terms, and efficiently and effectively integrate our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth. We may not be able to identify target companies that meet our strategic objectives or successfully negotiate and complete acquisitions with companies we have identified on acceptable terms. Additionally, the credit agreement we entered into in connection with our secured credit facility only permits us to make acquisitions under certain circumstances, and restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which limits to some extent our ability to make such acquisitions and investments. Further, the process of integrating acquired companies into our operations requires significant resources and is time consuming, expensive and disruptive to our business. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant challenges:\n\u2022\npotentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies;\n\u2022\nincorporating the acquired company\u2019s technology and products into our current and future product lines, and successfully generating market demand for these expanded product lines;\n\u2022\npotential additional geographic dispersion of operations;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in achieving anticipated synergies and efficiencies;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in integrating disparate operational and information systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated liabilities associated with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in leveraging the acquired company\u2019s and our combined technologies and capabilities across our product lines and customer base;\n\u2022\npotential sales disruptions as a result of integrating the acquired company\u2019s sales channels with our sales channels; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key customers, suppliers and employees of an acquired company.\nOur failure to successfully identify suitable target companies, negotiate and complete acquisitions, or achieve the anticipated benefits of any past or future acquisition or to successfully integrate and/or manage the operations of the companies we acquire could harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur significant charges in future periods to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions.\nWe may incur significant charges in future periods to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions, including asset impairment charges and other costs related to divestiture of acquired assets or businesses. Such charges could also include impairment of goodwill associated with past acquisitions. For example, 2012 sales by our former Ophir Division were below the levels that we had originally forecasted. As a result of those sales levels and other factors, in the course of our annual evaluation of the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined that goodwill and certain intangible and other assets associated with our former Ophir Division were impaired. We therefore recorded an impairment charge of $130.9 million to write down the goodwill and certain intangible and other assets associated with that division. We believe that the assumptions we use in evaluating the goodwill associated with our business are reasonable; however, we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in the future as a result of subsequent changes to the factors underlying such assumptions, and as a result of the criteria we are required to utilize in assessing whether impairment has occurred.\nThe terms of our secured credit facility impose significant financial obligations and risks upon us, limit our ability to take certain actions, and could discourage a change in control.\nOn July 18, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders, pursuant to which we obtained a new secured credit facility (credit facility) to refinance our prior credit facility. The credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility of $275 million with a term of five years. The credit agreement also provides us with the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of our loans in the form of additional revolving loans or a separate tranche of term loans, in an aggregate amount that does not exceed $50 million, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the\ncredit agreement. Our ability to borrow funds under the credit facility is subject to certain conditions, including compliance with certain covenants and the continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties. Our obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries, as well as a pledge of certain shares we hold in our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nThe credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including maintaining specific financial ratios. These ratios are based in part on our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement. Our ability to continue to meet these financial ratios and tests will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. In the event that we are unable to generate the levels of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA required to maintain compliance with such financial covenants, our borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be reduced, and we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to reduce our indebtedness under the credit facility, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other cash requirements.\nThe credit agreement and related documents also contain covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nmaterially change the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmerge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate with or into another entity;\n\u2022\nconsummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u2022\nprepay certain other indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nmake investments.\nThese covenants restrict our ability to engage in or benefit from these actions, thereby limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete, such as limiting our ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions. This could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe credit agreement contains customary events of default, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to make required payments;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with certain agreements or covenants;\n\u2022\nfailure to pay, or default permitting acceleration of, certain other indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncertain events of bankruptcy and insolvency; and\n\u2022\nfailure to pay certain judgments.\nOur ability to repay any amounts owed under the credit facility will depend upon our future cash balances. The amount of cash available for repayment of these amounts will depend on our usage of our existing cash balances and our operating performance and ability to generate cash flow from operations in future periods, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurances that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations. Any failure to repay these obligations as they become due would result in an event of default under the credit agreement.\nIf an event of default occurs, the lenders may end their obligation to make loans to us under the credit facility, and the lenders may declare any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement immediately due and payable. In such case, we would need to obtain additional financing or significantly deplete our available cash, or both, in order to repay this indebtedness. Any additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and significant depletion of our available cash could harm our ability to fund our operations or execute our broader corporate objectives.\nFurther, if we were unable to repay outstanding indebtedness following an event of default, then in addition to other available rights and remedies, the lenders could initiate foreclosure proceedings on substantially all of our assets. Any such foreclosure proceedings or other rights and remedies successfully implemented by the lenders in an event of default would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change, and if we fail to introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nMany of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, shifting customer needs, new product introductions and enhancements, and the periodic introduction of disruptive technology that displaces current technology due to a combination of price, performance and reliability. As a result, many of the products in our markets can become outdated quickly and without warning. We depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability to enhance our existing products, to anticipate and address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved and disruptive technologies, either through internal development or by acquisitions, and to be price competitive. If we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products, it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products. If we or our competitors introduce disruptive technology that displaces current technology, existing product platforms or lines of business from which we generate significant revenue may be rendered obsolete. In addition, because certain of our markets experience severe cyclicality in capital spending, if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns, or may fail to have our products or subsystems designed into our customers\u2019 products. We may not be successful in acquiring, developing, manufacturing or marketing new products and technologies on a timely or cost-effective basis. If we fail to adequately introduce new, competitive products and technologies on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nWe offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve.\nWe offer products for a number of markets. Because we operate in multiple markets, we must work constantly to understand the needs, standards and technical requirements of many different applications within these industries, and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries. Product development is costly and time consuming. We must anticipate trends in our customers\u2019 industries and develop products before our customers\u2019 products are commercialized. If we do not accurately predict our customers\u2019 needs and future activities, we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance. Our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size, growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market. If our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nUncertainty in the adoption or growth of emerging applications could reduce the revenue growth we expect to generate from these applications.\nWe are constantly investing in products for emerging applications, and we expect to generate increasingly significant revenue levels from sales of products for these applications. For example, we have developed ultrafast lasers for ophthalmic surgery, infrared optics for thermal imaging cameras and automobile night vision systems, precision motion subsystems for equipment used to manufacture and inspect 450 mm semiconductor wafers, and three-dimensional dental CAD/CAM scanners for manufacturing dental restorations. These applications are evolving, and the extent to which they achieve widespread adoption or significant growth is uncertain. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption or growth of these applications, including their cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability compared to alternatives. If these applications or our products for these applications are not widely adopted or fail to grow as we project, we will not generate the revenue growth we anticipate from sales of our products for these emerging applications, and our results of operations could be harmed.\nBecause the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict, and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation, we may experience fluctuations in our operating results.\nMany of our products are complex, and customers for these products require substantial time to qualify our products and make purchase decisions. In addition, some of our sales to defense and security customers are under major defense programs that involve lengthy competitive bidding and qualification processes. These customers often perform, or require us to perform, extensive configuration, testing and evaluation of our products before\ncommitting to purchasing them, which can require a significant upfront investment by us. The sales cycle for these products from initial contact through shipment varies significantly, is difficult to predict and can last more than one year. If we fail to anticipate the likelihood, costs, or timing associated with sales of these products, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nThe orders comprising our backlog are generally subject to rescheduling without penalty or cancellation without penalty other than reimbursement for certain labor and material costs. We have from time to time experienced order rescheduling and cancellations that have caused our sales in a given period to be materially less than would have been expected based on our backlog at the beginning of the period. If we experience such rescheduling and/or cancellations in the future, our operating results will fluctuate from period to period and could be harmed.\nIf we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace, our operating results will suffer.\nBecause many of our products are sophisticated and complex, they can be difficult to design and manufacture, and we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products. If we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion, our customers may choose to purchase our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, because certain of our OEM customers rarely change vendors during a product life cycle, if we fail to timely introduce new products and have them designed into our customers\u2019 new products at the beginning of such cycle, we may be foreclosed from selling those products until their introduction of a next-generation product. As such, our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results will be harmed.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive, and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future. We compete in several specialized markets, against a limited number of companies in each market. We also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours, or who engage subcontract manufacturers or system integrators to manufacture products or systems on their behalf. Some of our existing and potential competitors are more established, enjoy greater name recognition and possess greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we do, and some may have lower material costs than ours due to their control over sources of components and raw materials. Other competitors are small and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market. We compete on the basis of product performance, features, quality, reliability, the breadth of our product portfolio and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors. In addition, competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices, which would negatively affect our operating results. If we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, we may lose our competitive advantage and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in countries outside the United States, where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. Patent and trademark laws and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks and similar proprietary rights. In addition, patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us, and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which can demand significant financial and management resources. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications. Moreover, our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors, which claims could result in costly litigation, the diversion of our technical and management personnel and the assertion of counterclaims by the defendants, including counterclaims asserting invalidity of our patents. We will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost. For example, in 2012 we filed a lawsuit\nagainst Lighthouse Photonics Incorporated asserting infringement of certain of our patents by that company\u2019s laser products, which we settled on confidential terms in August 2014. If we are unsuccessful at effectively protecting our intellectual property, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, such as changing from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system, establishing new procedures for challenging patents and establishing different methods for invalidating patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is still in the process of implementing regulations relating to these changes, and the courts have yet to address many of the new provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act. Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous to us, and it may become more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our patents against third parties. While we cannot predict the impact of the Leahy-Smith Act at this time, these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, intellectual property infringement claims, which could be costly and time consuming to defend and may produce outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have from time to time received claims from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. Such infringement claims have in the past and may in the future result in litigation. For example, in 2008, Graywire, LLC filed a patent infringement case against us and other companies alleging infringement of certain optical device manufacturing patents, which case is currently pending. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly, and we could become subject to damages for infringement, or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks. Such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology may divert management\u2019s attention from other matters and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products. Any claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage the transition of certain of our manufacturing operations to other locations and/or to contract manufacturers could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our ongoing cost-reduction efforts, we continue to relocate the manufacture of certain of our existing product lines and subassemblies to, and initiate the manufacture of certain new products in, our facilities in Wuxi, China, Jerusalem, Israel and Bucharest, Romania and selected contract manufacturers in Asia. We also plan to relocate the manufacture of certain infrared optics and lens assemblies from our facility in North Andover, Massachusetts to our facility in Irvine, California within the next twelve months. If we are unable to successfully manage the relocation or initiation of the manufacture of these products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn particular, transferring product lines to other manufacturing locations and/or to our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities often requires us to transplant complex manufacturing equipment and processes across a large geographical distance and to train a completely new workforce concerning the use of this equipment and these processes. In addition, certain of our customers may require the requalification of products supplied to them in connection with the relocation of manufacturing operations. If we are unable to manage this transfer and training smoothly and comprehensively, or if we are unable to complete the requalification of products in a timely manner, we could suffer manufacturing and supply chain delays, excessive product defects, harm to our results of operations and our reputation with our customers, and loss of customers. We also may not realize the cost and tax advantages that we currently anticipate from locating operations in China, Israel and Romania. For example, we are experiencing rising material, labor and shipping costs and rapidly changing regulations in China.\nAdditionally, qualifying contract manufacturers and commencing volume production are expensive and time-consuming activities, and there is no guarantee we will continue to do so successfully. Further, our reliance on contract manufacturers reduces our control over the assembly process, quality assurance, production costs and material and component supply for our products. If we fail to manage our relationship with our contract manufacturers, or if any of the contract manufacturers experience financial difficulty, or delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control\nproblems in their operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. Further, if we or our contract manufacturers are unable to negotiate with suppliers for reduced component costs, our operating results could be harmed.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers may terminate our agreements with them upon prior notice to us or immediately for reasons such as if we become insolvent, or if we fail to perform a material obligation under the agreements. If we are required to change contract manufacturers or assume internal manufacturing operations for any reason, including the termination of one of our contracts, we will likely suffer manufacturing and shipping delays, lost revenue, increased costs and damage to our customer relationships, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by export controls.\nOur products and technology are subject to international export regulations in the various countries where they are manufactured or developed. For example, exports of our products and technology developed or manufactured in the U.S. are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. Government and administered by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. Similar export regulations govern exports of our products and technology developed or manufactured in certain other countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Israel and Romania. In certain instances, these regulations may require obtaining licenses from the administering agency prior to exporting products or technology to international locations or foreign nationals, including foreign nationals employed by us in the United States and abroad. For products and technology subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product and technology, the final destination and the identity and nationality of the end user. Virtually all exports from the United States of defense articles subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. The Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Israeli Ministry of Defense administer similar export regulations and license requirements, which apply to many of our products and technology developed or manufactured in Israel. Obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming, and we may not be successful in obtaining them. Failure to obtain export licenses to enable product and technology exports could reduce our revenue, harm our relationships with our customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with export regulations may also subject us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable export restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, if we or our international representatives or distributors fail to comply with any of these export regulations, we or they could be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, restrictions on our ability to export products and technology and damage to our reputation, and our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our business. Our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire, train, motivate and retain qualified personnel. Competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense. We have from time to time in the past experienced attrition in certain key positions, and we expect to continue to experience this attrition in the future. The absence of incentive plan bonuses and equity award vesting as a result of not meeting certain financial performance targets could adversely affect our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain and motivate our existing employees, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur reliance on sole source and limited source suppliers and service providers could result in delays in production and distribution of our products.\nWe obtain some of the materials and components used to build our products, systems and subsystems, such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables, the crystals and semiconductor laser diodes used in certain of our laser products and certain raw materials used for our thermal imaging and high-power laser optics, from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products. If our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts at acceptable quality levels or are unavailable on satisfactory terms, we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources, if available, which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products. If we do not obtain comparable\nreplacement components from other sources in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need. If we fail to accurately forecast our needs, or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products, then delays or reductions in production and shipment of our products could occur, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we obtain some of the critical capital equipment we use to manufacture certain of our products from sole or limited sources due to the unique nature of the equipment. In some cases, such equipment can only be serviced by the manufacturer or a very limited number of service providers due to the complex and specialized nature of the equipment. If service and/or spare parts for such equipment become unavailable, such equipment could be rendered inoperable, which could cause delays in the production of our products, and could require us to procure alternate equipment, if available, which would likely involve long lead times and significant additional cost, and could harm our results of operations.\nOur products could contain defects, which would increase our costs and seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nMany of our products, especially our laser products, opto-mechanical subassemblies and precision positioning systems, are inherently complex in design and, in some cases, require ongoing regular maintenance. Further, the manufacture of these products often involves a highly complex and precise process and the utilization of specially qualified components that conform to stringent specifications. As a result of the technical complexity of these products, design defects, changes in our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or nonconforming materials by us or our suppliers could adversely affect our manufacturing yields and product reliability. This could in turn harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nWe provide warranties for our products, and we accrue allowances for estimated warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue for the sale of the products. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty. We establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for our products. If actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other suppliers, which may contain defects. As a result, should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss of customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of product returns and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\nincreased costs required to analyze and mitigate the defects or problems;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfailure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and engineering resources; or\n\u2022\nlegal action by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to potential product liability claims which, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our products may be hazardous if not operated properly or if defective. In addition, some of our products, such as certain ultrafast lasers, are used in medical applications where malfunctions could result in serious injury. We are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if death, personal injury or property damage results from the use of our products. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. We currently maintain insurance against product liability claims. However, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept, if at\nall. This insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur. Further, if our products are defective, we may be required to recall or redesign these products. A successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level, or any claim or product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting each year, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management each year on our internal control over financial reporting. This report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. This report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on such internal controls. Management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments, some of which are in areas that may be open to interpretation. As such, our auditors may not agree with our management\u2019s assessments.\nIf we are unable to assert each year that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and we may be unable to file such reports in a timely manner, which would have an adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, if any unidentified material weaknesses were to result in fraudulent activity and/or a material misstatement or omission in our financial statements, we could suffer losses and be subject to civil and criminal penalties and litigation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the EPA, and we are subject to comparable authorities in other countries. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims by employees or third parties alleging such contamination or injury, and could be liable for damages, which liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage (if any) and the resources of our business.\nCertain portions of the soil at Spectra-Physics\u2019 former facility located in Mountain View, California, and certain portions of the aquifer surrounding the facility, through which contaminated groundwater flowed, are part of an EPA-designated Superfund site and are subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. Spectra-Physics, which we acquired in 2004 and merged into Newport in 2007, along with several other entities with facilities located near the Mountain View, California facility, were identified as Responsible Parties with respect to this Superfund site, due to releases of hazardous substances during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Spectra-Physics and the other Responsible Parties entered into a cost-sharing agreement covering the costs of remediating the off-site groundwater impact. The site is mature, and investigations, monitoring and remediation efforts by the Responsible Parties have been ongoing for approximately 30 years. However, we may be subject to additional remediation obligations in the future if the EPA and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board determine that the site has generated additional environmental contamination, or if more rigorous standards for environmental contamination are enacted or approved. In addition to our investigation, monitoring and remediation obligations, we may be liable for property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site. While we are not aware of any claims at this time, such claims could be made against us\nin the future. We have certain ongoing costs related to investigation, monitoring and remediation of the site that have been fairly consistent and not material in the recent past. However, our ultimate costs of remediation and other potential liabilities are difficult to predict. If significant costs or other liability relating to this site arise in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe environmental regulations that we are subject to include a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations that restrict the use and disposal of materials used in the manufacture of our products or require design changes or recycling of our products. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of manufacturing or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to equip our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product and the management of historical waste.\nGovernmental entities at all levels are continuously enacting new environmental regulations, and it is initially difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the requirements for compliance with such regulations as they are enacted. For example, the European Union has enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) for implementation in each European Union member country. RoHS regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products, and WEEE requires the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from certain products. Effective January 2013, RoHS was recast to expand the scope of equipment subject to the directive and impose new compliance requirements, and most European Union member states implemented the recast directive during 2013. WEEE was also recast to expand the scope of equipment subject to the directive and impose increased combined reuse/recycling and collection targets, among other revisions, and European Union member states began to implement the recast directive in 2014. Certain of our products sold in these countries are or will become subject to RoHS and WEEE requirements. We will continue to monitor RoHS and WEEE guidance in individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities. In some instances, we are not directly responsible for compliance with RoHS and WEEE because certain of our products are currently outside the scope of the directives. However, because the scope of the directives continues to expand, we will likely be directly or contractually subject to certain provisions of such regulations in the case of many of our products. In addition, certain of our customers, particularly OEM customers whose end products may be subject to these directives, may require that the products we supply to them comply with these directives. Further, final legislation from individual jurisdictions that have not yet implemented the directives may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us. We are also aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or being considered in various states within the United States, as well as other countries, such as Japan, China and South Korea. These regulations may require us to redesign our products or source alternative components to ensure compliance with applicable requirements, for example by mandating the use of different types of materials in certain components. Any such redesign or alternative sourcing may increase the cost of our products, adversely impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions, or in some cases limit the markets for certain products. Our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in certain countries.\nDifficulties with our global information technology systems, and/or unauthorized access to such systems, could harm our business.\nAny failure or malfunctioning of our global information technology system, errors or misuse by system users, difficulties in migrating standalone systems to our centralized systems, or inadequacy of the system in addressing the needs of our operations, could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such failure, errors, misuse or inadequacy could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process, report and evaluate key operations metrics and key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any such disruptions would likely divert our management and key employees\u2019 attention away from other business matters. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our global information technology system could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn connection with our daily business transactions, we store data about our business, including certain customer data, on our global information technology systems. While our systems are designed with security measures to prevent unauthorized access, third parties may gain unauthorized access to our systems. This unauthorized access could take the\nform of intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, employee malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information, in order to gain access to our information technology system for the purpose of sabotage, or to access our data, including our and our customers\u2019 intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems evolve frequently and generally are not recognized until successful, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in disruption to our business, misappropriation or loss of data, loss of confidence in us by our customers, damage to our reputation, legal liability and a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rule requires companies to verify and disclose whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. To comply with this rule, we are required to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry each year and, depending on the results of that inquiry, we may be required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals contained in our products. Such due diligence must conform to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework. We are required to file a disclosure report with the SEC in May of each year relating to the preceding calendar year. In addition, commencing with the disclosure report relating to the 2015 calendar year, to the extent that we are required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals, we will be required to obtain an independent private sector audit of our disclosure report and underlying due diligence measures.\nThe due diligence activities required to determine the source and chain of custody of minerals contained in our products are time consuming and may result in significant costs. Due to the size and complexity of our supply chain, we face significant challenges in verifying the origins of the minerals used in our products. Further, this rule could affect the availability in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. There may be only a limited number of sources of \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals, which could result in increased material and component costs, as well as additional costs associated with potential changes to our products, processes or sources of supply.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the minerals used in our products through the due diligence measures that we implement, or if we are unable to obtain an audit report each year that concludes that our due diligence measures are in conformity with the criteria set forth in the relevant due diligence framework, our reputation could be harmed. In addition, we may not be able to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as \u201cconflict-free,\u201d which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nNatural disasters or power outages could disrupt or shut down our operations or those of our contract manufacturers, which would negatively impact our operations.\nWe are headquartered and have significant operations in the State of California and other areas where our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes, floods, fire, loss of power or water supplies, or other similar contingencies. Our contract manufacturers\u2019 operations are also subject to these occurrences, such as the severe flooding that periodically occurs in Thailand. We currently have business continuation plans for our global information technology systems and for most of our operations and facilities, as well as disaster recovery procedures for our remaining operations and facilities. Despite these contingency plans and procedures, if any of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers were to experience a catastrophic loss or significant power outages, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility, any of which would harm our business. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes.", "PERMNO": 57534, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "NEWP"}
