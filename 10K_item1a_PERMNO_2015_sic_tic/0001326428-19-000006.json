RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile. A decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities, and their prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in market uncertainty and the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Beginning in the second half of 2014, oil and natural gas prices began a rapid and significant decline as global supply exceeded demand. This oversupply continued through the first half of 2016 and led to troughs in oil and natural gas prices, which at their lowest NYMEX prices were $27.45 per Bbl and $1.64 per MMBtu, respectively. Although average oil and natural gas prices increased in the first nine months of 2018, reaching levels as high as $76.41 per Bbl and $4.84 per MMBtu, respectively, they began to decline again in the fourth quarter of 2018 reaching levels as low as $44.48 per Bbl and $2.72 per MMBtu. Likewise, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics suffered significant declines in realized prices but also began to recover in the second half of 2017 and during the year ended December 31, 2018, reaching levels as high as $10.46 per MMBtu. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional political or economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of commodity storage inventories;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the area in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing reserves and transporting production;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and production;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading in oil, natural gas and NGL markets;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nU.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower commodity prices may reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to develop our reserves could be adversely affected. Furthermore, using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits. In addition, sustained periods with oil and natural gas prices at levels lower\nthan current WTI or Henry Hub prices may adversely affect our drilling economics and our ability to raise capital, which may require us to re-evaluate and postpone or eliminate our development drilling, and result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves and the net present value of our reserves. If we are required to curtail our drilling program, we may be unable to continue to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce our reserves. As a result, a further reduction or sustained decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain required capital or financing as needed or on acceptable terms, which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital-intensive. We currently make, and expect to continue making, substantial capital expenditures. We expect to fund our 2019 capital expenditures with cash generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facility and access to capital markets; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil, natural gas and NGL prices; actual drilling results; the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment; and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe volume and types of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nthe levels of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, and we are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion.\nOur assets were contributed to Roan LLC in August 2017 by Linn and Citizen. Under management services agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d), Linn and Citizen operated the contributed oil and natural gas assets on our behalf until May 2018, at which time our management team took over as operator of the contributed oil and natural gas properties. As a result, there is only limited historical financial and operational information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance.\nIn addition, we have grown rapidly over the last year. Our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties:\n\u2022\nincreased responsibilities for our executive level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nincreased capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased organizational challenges common to large, expansive operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties. The historical financial information incorporated herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be realized in the future. In addition, our operating history is limited and the results from our current producing wells are not necessarily indicative of success from our future drilling operations.\nRestrictions in our credit facility could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur credit facility contains a number of significant covenants, including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\nmake or declare dividends;\n\u2022\nenter into commodity hedges exceeding a specified percentage of our expected production or proved reserves;\n\u2022\nenter into interest rate hedges exceeding a specified percentage of our outstanding indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios.\nThe restrictions in our credit facility may also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our credit facility impose on us.\nA breach of any covenant in our credit facility would result in a default under such facility after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, as of December 31, 2018, we had $514.6 million of debt outstanding, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.21%, and a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $5.1 million, assuming no change in the amount of debt outstanding. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, will determine semiannually on April 1st and October 1st of each year. The borrowing base will depend on, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the proved oil and natural gas properties securing our credit facility and hedging arrangements. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our credit facility. Any increase in the borrowing base will require the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our credit facility as a result of a decrease in borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations if other lenders are unable to provide additional funding to cover any defaulting lender\u2019s position. Declines in commodity prices could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and, in such a case, we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. As a result, we may be unable to implement our drilling plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations, including our credit facility, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves may vary from our estimates. For instance, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates, our recovery efficiencies may be worse than expected, and production declines may be greater than we estimate and may be more rapid and irregular when compared to initial production rates. In addition, we may adjust reserve estimates to reflect additional production history, results of development activities, current commodity prices and other existing factors. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. Using lower prices in estimating proved reserves would likely result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.\nThe standardized measure of our estimated reserves contained in this Annual Report and in the footnotes to our financial statements is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated reserves.\nStandardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Standardized measure requires the use of specific pricing as required by the SEC, as well as operating and development costs prevailing as of the date\nof computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flow may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the standardized measure of our estimated reserves included in this Annual Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves.\nThe development of our estimated PUDs may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated PUDs may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 61% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Development of these proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated PUDs and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to lose leases through expiration or could cause us to reclassify our PUDs as unproved reserves. Further, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within five years after their respective dates of booking.\nOur future cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent on our ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, acquisition and production activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nOur decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, please see \u201cRisk Factors-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\u201d In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, including those relating to water supply, discharge and disposal of waste water and other hazardous materials, emission of GHGs and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational incidents;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, fires or explosions, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\ndeclines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ntitle problems; and\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nCertain of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value, we may be required to take impairment write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that our proved oil and natural gas properties should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment tests, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We did not incur impairment charges of proved properties during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nWe enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of any derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthere are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nIf we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced. Any future collateral requirements will depend on financial and industry market conditions and arrangements with our counterparties. In addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas, which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Alternatively, higher oil and natural gas prices may result in significant non-cash fair value losses being incurred on our derivatives, which could cause us to experience net losses associated with those hedging contracts when oil and natural gas prices rise. Additionally, in times of low commodity prices, our ability to enter into additional commodity derivative contracts with favorable commodity price terms may be limited, which may adversely impact our future revenues and cash flows as compared to historical periods during which we were able to hedge our oil and natural gas production at higher prices.\nOur commodity derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make the counterparty unable to perform under the terms of the contract, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.\nDuring periods of declining commodity prices, our derivative contract asset positions generally increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss with respect to our commodity derivative contracts.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC to promulgate a range of rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may enter or the ability and willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to or otherwise impacted by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nWe have an extensive inventory of future potential drilling locations that could be developed over an extended period of time, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or raise the substantial amount of capital that may be necessary to drill such locations.\nSubject to our management determining an appropriate number of wells to drill per section from a spacing perspective, we expect to identify a large number of future drilling locations on our existing acreage. These drilling locations will represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations will depend on a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, access to suitable surface drilling pad locations, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the drilling locations our management team identifies will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other drilling locations.\nIn addition, we may require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital or financing required to do so. Please see \u201c-Our business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain required capital or financing as needed or on acceptable terms, which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves.\u201d\nApproximately 16% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 16% of our net leasehold acreage was undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. Further, to the extent we determine that it is not economic to develop particular undeveloped acreage, we may intentionally allow leases to expire.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is generally our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the leases and underlying mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nIn addition, certain of the new techniques we are adopting may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. Furthermore, the results of any drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If our drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production, which may cause volatility in our quarterly operating results.\nWe will not be the operator on all of our acreage or drilling locations, and, therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs or the rate of production of any non-operated assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had over 170,000 net acres in the Merge, STACK and SCOOP plays of the Anadarko Basin, approximately 71% of which we operated. As of December 31, 2018, we were the operator on 591 gross (449 net) of our 1,263 gross (502 net) producing wells. We will have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners and there is the risk that our partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Furthermore, the success and timing of development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022\nthe selection of technology; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThis limited ability to exercise control over the operations and associated costs of some of our drilling locations could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activity.\nAdverse weather conditions may negatively affect our operating results and our ability to conduct drilling activities.\nAdverse weather conditions may cause, among other things, increases in the costs of, and delays in, drilling or completing new wells, power failures, temporary shut-in of production and difficulties in the transportation of our oil, natural gas and NGLs. Any decreases in production due to poor weather conditions will have an adverse effect on our revenues, which will in turn negatively affect our cash flow from operations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in Oklahoma in past years. Although we have not been directly affected to date, these drought conditions have led governmental authorities in other areas of the state to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, or if we experience delays in obtaining water sourcing permits or other rights, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are located in the Merge, STACK and SCOOP plays within the Anadarko Basin, in Oklahoma, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Merge, STACK and SCOOP plays within the Anadarko Basin in Central Oklahoma. At December 31, 2018, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we are disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought-related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nThe marketability and pricing of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities and various market factors, which we generally do not control. If these facilities are unavailable or we become subject to adverse pricing differentials, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation and other production facilities owned by third parties. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to produce or deliver to market our oil, natural gas and NGLs, causing a significant\ninterruption in our operations. While we believe we have reserved sufficient capacity with third-party facilities to gather, process, fractionate and transport a significant portion of our projected production, that capacity may not be sufficient to handle all of our production, or these third-party facilities may experience delays in construction, mechanical problems or become unavailable to us due to unforeseen circumstances.\nAdditionally, we depend on various trucking providers for our oil production and on two third-party midstream companies for substantially all of our current natural gas and NGL production. Our current natural gas and NGL arrangements provide for pricing at Mont Belvieu, Texas, but future arrangements could be tied to pricing at Conway, Kansas or other market hubs and subject us to adverse pricing differentials. In the future, we may be required to find alternative markets and gathering, processing or fractionation arrangements for our production, and such alternative arrangements may only be available on unfavorable terms, or not at all. If we are unable, for any sustained period, to access these third-party facilities or find acceptable alternative arrangements, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for gathering, processing, fractionating and delivering the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our fields, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to acreage dedications and one of our current midstream contracts contains a minimum volume commitment.\nWe are currently party to midstream contracts that contain acreage dedications through November 2030. We have multiple dedications within certain of our operated sections. As a result, we are required to manage our production to ensure these commitments are satisfied. If we are unable to effectively manage these split dedications within a section with multiple dedications, we would be in breach of one of the midstream contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may enter into firm transportation, gas processing, gathering and compression service, water handling and treatment, or other agreements that require minimum volume delivery commitments. We are currently party to a firm transportation agreement, which contains an aggregate minimum volume commitment of natural gas that is required to be delivered from a specific area by November 2021. Although we expect to meet the minimum volume delivery commitment under this contract, in the event that we are unable to fully satisfy this natural gas volume delivery commitment, we would incur deficiency fees. Lower commodity prices may lead to reductions in our drilling program, which may result in insufficient production to utilize our full firm transportation and processing capacity. If we have insufficient production to meet the minimum volumes under this agreement or any other firm commitment agreement we may enter into, our cash flow from operations will be reduced, which may require us to reduce or delay our planned investments and capital expenditures or seek alternative means of financing, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nOur top four customers represented approximately 77% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. Loss of one of these purchasers could adversely affect our revenues in the short term.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur development activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as unpermitted releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater, air and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business.\nCertain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions, including city ordinances, which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business. Such restrictions could affect, among other things, our access to and the permissible uses of our facilities as well as the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general. The costs we incur to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature, and we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities\nand perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. The unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. As conditions in the oil and natural gas industry improve, demand for drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities will likely increase, as will the costs for those items. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources and facilities access necessary for us to engage in our anticipated development activities could negatively impact our production volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling equipment, materials and supplies. However, such costs may rise faster than increases in our revenue if commodity prices rise, thereby negatively impacting our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget. This impact may be magnified to the extent that our ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by our derivative activities.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In the event we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. Competition for acquisitions may also increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to enter into acquisition transactions. Our credit facility also limits our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions of properties.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022\noperating costs; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and occupational health and safety issues that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment (such as the venting or flaring of natural gas and the emission of GHGs and other air pollutants), the generation, management and disposal of solid or hazardous wastes and the protection of the environment and natural resources (including threatened and endangered species). These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting drilling and other regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations, and reclamation and restoration costs. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, natural resource damages, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations or specific projects and limit our growth and revenue.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of historical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased and owned properties. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the investigation, removal or remediation of contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nThe trend in environmental regulation has been towards more stringent requirements, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the NAAQS for ground level ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per billion (\u201cppb\u201d) for the current 8 hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards, and completed attainment/non-attainment designations in July 2018. States are expected to implement more stringent permitting and pollution control requirements as a result of this final rule, which could apply to our operations. While the EPA has determined that all counties in which we operate are in attainment with the new ozone standards, these determinations may be revised in\nthe future. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in these newly designated non-attainment areas. Separately, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities (such as tank batteries and compressor stations), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. Compliance with these and other more stringent air pollution control and permitting standards and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit our ability to develop oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, the costs of which could be significant. Please see \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry-Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife and their habitat may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife and their habitat. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. For example, in November 2016, FWS completed initial reviews of a petition filed by environmental groups to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as endangered and found substantial information that the petitioned action may be warranted. An assessment of the biological status of the Lesser Prairie Chicken began in 2015, and further action remains pending. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities that could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory agency administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EPAct 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to approximately $1.2 million per day for each violation. The FERC may also impose administrative and criminal remedies and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and regulations pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Additionally, the FTC has regulations intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry with authority to fine violators of the regulations civil penalties of up to approximately $1.2 million per day, and the CFTC prohibits market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC, including similar anti manipulation authority with respect to swaps and futures contracts as that granted to the CFTC with respect to oil purchases and sales. The CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of approximately $1.1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\u201d\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that typically will be established by state agencies. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations. Recent federal regulatory action with respect to GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector has focused on methane emissions. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published performance standards, known as Subpart OOOOa for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is pending. The BLM also finalized a similar rule regarding the control of methane emissions in November 2016 that applies to oil and natural gas exploration and development activities on public and tribal lands. In September 2018, the BLM issued a final rule rescinding the agency\u2019s 2016 methane rule, and litigation challenging the rescission is pending. As a result of the developments described above, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPA and BLM methane rules. However, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and natural gas production activities.\nThere has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional cap and trade programs have emerged that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets (\u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force on November 4, 2016; however, the Paris Agreement does impose any binding obligations on its participants. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict how new laws or regulations in the United States or any legal requirements imposed by the Paris Agreement on the United States, should it not withdraw from the agreement, that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations as well as result in delays or restrictions in our ability to permit\nGHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment governing the oil and natural gas industry, particularly changes in the current Oklahoma forced pooling system, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to various forms of extensive government regulation, including laws and regulations concerning the location, spacing and permitting of the oil and natural gas wells we drill and the disposal of saltwater produced from such wells, among other matters. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment governing our industry, particularly any changes to Oklahoma statutory forced pooling procedures that make forced pooling more difficult to accomplish, could result in increased compliance costs and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, leak detection, and permitting and separately published an effluent limitation guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. In addition, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 establishing stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, including well casing and wastewater storage requirements and an obligation for exploration and production operators to disclose what chemicals they are using in fracturing activities. However, in December 2017, BLM issued a final rule repealing the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule, and litigation regarding this rescission is pending.\nAdditionally, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, but, at this time, federal legislation related to hydraulic fracturing appears unlikely. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, operational or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, or that prohibit hydraulic altogether. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.\nIn the event that a new, federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPlease see \u201cBusiness-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry-Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nOur use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical. In addition, the use of advanced technologies, such as 3-D seismic data, requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of saltwater gathered from such activities, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies continue to study a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, seismic events in connection with our drilling and completion activities. Certain of these events, if above certain levels, may result in suspension of drilling or completion activities by the OCC. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, additional requirements related to produced water disposal wells to improve seismic safety. For example, in Oklahoma, the OCC has implemented a variety of measures including the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system,\u201d pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells\u2019 depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC, from time to time, has developed\nand implemented plans calling for wells within areas of interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. We dispose of large volumes of saltwater gathered from our drilling and production operations pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities. In addition, we could be subject to third-party lawsuits alleging damages resulting from seismic events that occur in our areas of operation. The adoption and implementation of any new laws, regulations or orders that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of saltwater gathered from our drilling and production activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil, natural gas and NGL producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems\nwere to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil, natural gas and NGLs and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs the successor registrant to Linn, we must comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), related regulations of the SEC with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until we cease to be a non-accelerated filer. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we identify and report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe had an overall lack of qualified personnel within the organization who possessed an appropriate level of expertise, experience and training to effectively design, implement and maintain:\n(i) Adequate controls to monitor and assess the control environment. Specifically, internal controls were not designed or operating effectively to ensure appropriate monitoring or assessment of the control environment, including utilizing an appropriate control framework.\n(ii) Adequate controls to establish appropriate entity level controls. Specifically, internal controls were not designed or operating effectively to ensure a sufficient amount of entity level controls were in place and operating effectively.\n(iii) Effective controls over our period-end financial reporting processes, including controls over the preparation, analysis and review of certain significant account reconciliations required to assess the appropriateness of account balances at period-end; and controls over segregation of duties and the review of manual journal entries. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that journal entries were properly prepared with sufficient supporting documentation or were reviewed and approved to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the manual journal entries. Additionally, certain key accounting personnel have the ability to prepare and post journal entries, as well as review account reconciliations, without an independent review by someone other than the preparer.\n(iv) Effective controls over information technology systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain (a) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to infrastructure, financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate personnel, (b) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately, (c) computer operation controls to ensure all financially significant batch jobs are monitored for the completeness and accuracy of data transfer, and (d) program development controls to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. The deficiencies described in this clause (iv), when aggregated, could impact both maintaining effective segregation of duties and the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n(v) Effective controls over our reservoir engineering process for estimating proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, which are used in the calculation of depletion of the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas properties. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to verify that the Company\u2019s ownership interests in its oil and natural gas properties used in the reservoir engineering process are sufficiently reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy of the information.\n(vi) A sufficient complement of resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training to develop and maintain an effective internal control environment.\nThese material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements of our financial statements or disclosures. The material weaknesses could, however, result in a misstatement of relevant account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nBecause of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nWe have taken and will continue to take a number of actions to remediate these material weaknesses. We are currently implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, including but not limited to, (i) hiring additional IT and accounting personnel with appropriate technical skillsets, (ii) initiating design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of formal accounting and IT policies and procedures and financial reporting controls, (iii) conducting a company-wide assessment of our control environment, (iv) implementing appropriate review and oversight responsibilities within the accounting and financial reporting functions, and (v) evaluating controls over our information technology environment. We can give no assurance that these actions will remediate these material weaknesses in internal controls or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. However, our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership among our largest stockholders and their affiliates will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 75% (50% of which is beneficially owned by Roan Holdings) of our outstanding Class A common stock. Consequently, they will continue to have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Because our board will be classified through the 2020 annual meeting, certain of our directors will not come up for election until after the 2020 annual meeting. This concentration of ownership and the rights of our principal stockholders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial.\nIn connection with the Reorganization, we entered into a stockholders\u2019 agreement with the principal stockholders. The stockholders\u2019 agreement provides the principal stockholders with the right to designate a certain number of nominees to our board of directors through the 2020 annual meeting so long as the principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively beneficially own certain amounts of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. The existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Moreover, the concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders.\nFurthermore, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our principal stockholders and their respective affiliates, including portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning\namong other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. Several of our principal stockholders are private equity firms or investment funds in the business of making investments in entities in a variety of industries. As a result, our principal stockholders\u2019 existing and future portfolio companies may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor. Certain of our principal stockholders owning approximately 25% of our outstanding Class A common stock own a significant interest in Riviera, the owner of Blue Mountain.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations and acquisition activities, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliates of our principal stockholders) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring oil and natural gas properties. The existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. Messrs. Taylor, Lederman and Bonanno serve on the board of directors of Riviera, the owner of Blue Mountain.\nNone of the principal stockholders, nor any of their respective affiliates are limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable each of them to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that our principal stockholders and each of their respective affiliates (including portfolio investments of any of them) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits such persons to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if any of such persons or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of any of such persons who is also one of our directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nOur principal stockholders or their respective affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, our principal stockholders or their respective affiliates may dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business\nopportunity that may be from time to time presented to our principal stockholders or their respective affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our second amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our second amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and our credit facility places certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Class A common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our credit facility places certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your Class A common stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid for it.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A common stock in one or more future public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock. We have 152,539,532 outstanding shares of Class A common stock. We are authorized to issue 800,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. The potential issuance of such additional shares of equity securities will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of the holders of our Class A common stock and may create downward pressure on the trading price, if any, of our Class A common stock. The registration rights of the selling stockholders and the sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock following the effectiveness of shelf registration statements for the benefit of such holders, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital. We also may grant additional registration rights in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 18246, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ROAN"}
