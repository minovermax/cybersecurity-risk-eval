{"cik": "1358356", "company": "LIMESTONE BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to certain risks, which are particular to the Company, as well as the industry and markets in which the Company operates. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this filing. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future. The value or market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and an investor could lose all or part of their investment.\nThere are factors, many beyond the Company\u2019s control, which may significantly change the results or expectations of the Company. Some of these factors are described below, however, many are described in the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic creates significant risks and uncertainties for the Company\u2019s business.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities, including those in markets in which the Company is located or does business.\nAs a result, the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services has been, and will continue to be, significantly impacted. Furthermore, the pandemic could influence the recognition of credit losses in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and increase its allowance for loan losses as both businesses and consumers are negatively impacted by the economic downturn. In addition, governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The business operations of the Bank may also be disrupted if significant portions of its workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, travel restrictions, technology limitations, and/or disruptions. Furthermore, the business operations of the Company and Bank have been, and may again in the future be, disrupted due to vendors and third-party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nIn response to the pandemic, the Bank has made certain accommodations to customers, which may negatively impact revenue and other results of operations of the Company in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s customers, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, asset valuations such as goodwill, loan collections, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nBank Lending, Allowance for Loan Losses and Other Real Estate Owned\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and by economic conditions generally.\nWeakness in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the Company\u2019s markets may have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business:\n\u25cf\nA decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services the Bank offers;\n\u25cf\nA decrease in the value of collateral securing the Bank\u2019s loans; and\n\u25cf\nAn increase in the number of customers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans.\nAdverse conditions in the general business environment have had an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business in the past. Certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values, rents, and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets. These economic indicators typically affect the real estate and financial services industries, in which the Bank has a significant number of customers, more significantly than other economic sectors. Furthermore, the Bank has a substantial lending business that depends upon the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. Should economic conditions experience stress, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Bank\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions.\nMost of the Bank\u2019s business activities are conducted in Kentucky and contiguous states with most of its credit exposure is in that region. The Bank is at risk from adverse economic or business developments affecting this area, including declining regional and local business and employment activity, a downturn in real estate values and agricultural activities, and natural disasters. To the extent the economy weakens, delinquency rates, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and losses in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio will likely increase. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be adversely affected by the economic downturn or a localized natural disaster. Events that adversely affect business activity and real estate values have had in the past and may in the future to have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nSmall to medium-sized business portfolio may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy.\nThe loan portfolio includes loans to small and medium-sized businesses and other commercial enterprises. Small and medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need additional capital to expand or compete, and may experience variations in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons. The death, disability, or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay the loan. A continued economic downturn may have a more pronounced negative impact on the target market, causing the Bank to incur substantial credit losses that could materially harm operating results.\nThe Bank\u2019s decisions regarding credit risk may not be accurate, and its allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio based on historical loan loss experience, economic and environmental factors, specific problem loans, value of underlying collateral, and other relevant factors. If management\u2019s assessment of these factors is ultimately inaccurate, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual future loan losses, which would adversely affect operating results. Management\u2019s estimates are subjective, and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events. Changes in economic, operating, and other conditions that are generally beyond the Bank\u2019s control could cause actual loan losses to increase significantly. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their supervisory functions, periodically review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Regulatory agencies may require an increase in provision for loan losses or to recognize additional loan charge-offs when their judgment differs. Any of these events could have a material negative impact on operating results.\nLevels of classified loans and non-performing assets may increase in the future if economic conditions cause borrowers to default. Furthermore, the value of the collateral underlying a given loan, and the realizable value of such collateral in a foreclosure sale, may decline, making it less likely to realize a full recovery if a borrower defaults on a loan. Any increases in the level of non-performing assets, loan charge-offs or provision for loan losses, or the inability to realize the estimated net value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default, could negatively affect the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\nIf the Bank experiences greater credit losses than anticipated, its operating results would be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, the Bank is exposed to the risk that borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Credit risk with respect to the real estate and construction loan portfolio will relate principally to the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans. Credit risk with respect to the commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within the local markets.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for estimated loss losses based on a number of factors. Management believes the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if assumptions or judgments are wrong, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. Management may have to increase the allowance in the future at the request of one of the Bank\u2019s primary regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nA large percentage of the Bank\u2019s loans are collateralized by real estate, and any prolonged weakness in the real estate market may result in losses and adversely affect profitability.\nApproximately 70.7% of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020, was comprised of commercial and residential loans collateralized by real estate. Adverse economic conditions could decrease demand for real estate and depress real estate values in the Company\u2019s markets. Persistent weakness in the real estate market could significantly impair the value of loan collateral and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If real estate values decline, it will become more likely that management would be required to increase the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. If during a period of depressed real estate values, management was required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase the allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce the Bank\u2019s profitability and adversely affect its financial condition.\nThe Bank offers real estate construction and development loans, which carry a higher degree of risk than other real estate loans.\nApproximately 9.7% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 consisted of real estate construction and development loans, up from 7.0% at December 31, 2019 and down from 11.4% at December 31, 2018. These loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and permanent financing or sale of the property. If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to its completion, it may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan or it may be required to fund additional money to complete the project, or hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Any of these outcomes may result in losses and adversely affect profitability and financial condition.\nThe CECL accounting standard will result in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model. Whereas the incurred loss model delays recognition of loss on financial instruments until it is probable a loss has occurred, the expected loss model will recognize a loss at the time the loan is first added to the balance sheet. As result of this differing methodology, the Company expects adoption of the CECL model will materially affect the determination of the allowance and could require a significant increase to the allowance. Any material increase to the required level of loan loss allowance could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The CECL standard will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2023. See Note 1, \u201cNew Accounting Standards\u201d for discussion regarding the standard. Adoption will likely result in a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance and stockholders\u2019 equity. Interagency guidance issued in December 2018 allows for a three-year phase-in of the cumulative-effect adjustment for regulatory capital reporting.\nThe Bank may acquire or hold from time to time OREO properties, which could increase operating expenses and result in future losses to the Company.\nIn the past, the Bank has acquired and disposed of a significant amount of real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure that is listed on the balance sheet as other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d). An increase in the OREO portfolio increases the expenses incurred to manage and dispose of these properties, which sometimes includes funding construction required to facilitate sale.\nProperties in the Company\u2019s OREO portfolio are recorded at fair value, which represents the estimated sales price of the properties on the date acquired less estimated selling costs. Generally, in determining \u201cfair value\u201d an orderly disposition of the property is assumed, except where a different disposition strategy is expected. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current may change during periods of market volatility. Any decreases in market prices of real estate may lead to additional OREO write downs, with a corresponding expense in the statement of operations. Management evaluates OREO property values periodically and writes down the carrying value of the properties if and when the results of the Company\u2019s analysis require it.\nIn response to market conditions and other economic factors, management may utilize alternative sale strategies other than orderly disposition as part of the Bank\u2019s OREO disposition strategy, such as auctions or bulk sales. In this event, as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of OREO properties. In addition, the disposition of OREO through alternative sales strategies could impact the fair value of comparable OREO properties remaining in the portfolio. Generally, state regulatory requirements limit the period a Bank is permitted to hold OREO to ten years. All OREO properties held by the Bank at December 31, 2020 are currently under contract for sale.\nInterest Rates, Asset-Liability Management, Liquidity, and Common Stock\nProfitability is vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates could harm financial condition or results of operations. The results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic or international economic or political conditions. Factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as inflation, recession, unemployment, and money supply may also affect interest rates. If, as a result of decreasing interest rates, interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities in a given period, net interest income may decrease. Likewise, net interest income may decrease if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates.\nFixed-rate loans increase the exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest-bearing liabilities may be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing. Fixed rate investment securities are subject to fair value declines as interest rates rise. Adjustable-rate loans decrease the risk associated with rising interest rates but involve other risks, such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment. At the same time, for secured loans, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates, which could reduce net interest income and harm results of operations.\nThe planned phasing out of the LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments originated or held by the Company.\nThe LIBOR is the reference rate used for many transactions, including lending and borrowing, as well as the derivatives that may be used to manage risk related to such transactions. LIBOR will cease to exist as a published rate after 2021. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR could have a significant impact on the financial markets and market participants such as the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $138.5 million in variable rate loans with interest rates tied to LIBOR, of which approximately $121.5 million have maturity dates beyond December 31, 2021.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank, through the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has recommended a replacement benchmark rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). All loan contracts extending beyond 2021 will need to be managed effectively to ensure appropriate benchmark rate replacements are provided for and adopted.\nFailure to identify a replacement benchmark rate and/or update data processing systems could result in future interest rate changes not being correctly captured, which could result in interest rate risk not being mitigated as intended, or interest earned being miscalculated, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Uncertainty regarding LIBOR and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiations of fall-back provisions could result in pricing volatility, adverse tax or accounting impacts, or additional compliance, legal and operational costs.\nIf the Bank cannot obtain adequate funding, it may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity policies and limits are established by the Board of Directors of the Bank, with operating limits managed and monitored by the Asset Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d), based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits and the percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The ALCO regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the Company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to meet unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. If the Company\u2019s liquidity policies and strategies do not work as well as intended, the Bank may be unable to make loans and repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. The ALCO follows established board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Company\u2019s wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one-market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.\nThe Bank maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other available sources of liquidity, including additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common shares in public or private transactions. If the Bank is unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might not be able to meet the needs of customers, which could adversely impact its financial condition, its results of operations, cash flows, and its level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company depends on dividends and distributions paid to it by its banking subsidiary.\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. The principal source of cash flow, from which it would fund any dividends paid to shareholders, has historically been dividends the Company receives from the Bank. Regulations of the FDIC and the KDFI govern the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to the Company, and regulations of the Federal Reserve govern the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. Since the Bank will not be in a position to pay dividends to the Company without prior regulatory approval until retained earnings are positive, cash inflows for the Company are limited to proceeds from common stock, preferred stock, or debt issuances. See the \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividends.\u201d\nThe Company may sell capital stock in the future to raise additional capital or for additional liquidity. Future sales or other dilution of equity may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\nThe issuance of additional common shares or securities convertible into common shares would dilute the ownership interest of the Company\u2019s existing common shareholders. The market price of the Company\u2019s common shares could decline as a result of such an offering as well as other sales of a large block of shares of common shares or similar securities in the market after such an offering, or the perception that such sales could occur. The Company\u2019s common shares have traded from time-to-time at a price below book value per share. A sale of common shares at or below book value would be dilutive to current shareholders. The sale of shares at a price below market value could negatively impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nThe Company may not be able to realize the value of its deferred tax assets.\nDue to losses in prior years, the Company has a net operating loss carry-forward of $22.0 million, credit carry-forwards of $208,000, and other net deferred tax assets of $3.5 million. In order to realize the benefit of these tax losses, credits, and deductions, the Company must generate substantial taxable income in future periods. Deferred tax assets are calculated using a federal corporate tax rate of 21%. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect deferred tax assets in the future. If higher federal corporate tax rates are enacted, net deferred tax assets would be increased commensurate with the rate increase. Additionally, should the Company need to raise additional capital by issuing new common shares or securities convertible into common shares, then depending on the number of common share equivalents issued, it could trigger a \u201cchange in control,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such an event could negatively impact or limit the ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards, credit loss carry-forwards, and other net deferred tax assets.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.\nThe Company regularly explores opportunities to acquire banks, branches, financial institutions, or other financial services businesses or assets. The Company cannot predict the number, size, or timing of acquisitions. Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may cause the Company not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the Company\u2019s business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected. The Company may also issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to current shareholders.\nLitigation\nRisk related to legal proceedings.\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from the Company\u2019s business activities and fiduciary responsibilities. The Company establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company may still incur legal costs for a matter even if a reserve has not been established. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending or future legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nDeposit Insurance Expense\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments can impact non-interest expense.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, the Bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments. FDIC assessments for deposit insurance are based on the average total consolidated assets of the insured institution during the assessment period, less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. Any increase in assessment rates may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCompetition, Management\nThe Bank faces strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service companies, which could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank competes with other financial institutions in attracting deposits and making loans. The competition in attracting deposits comes principally from other commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds. The competition in making loans comes principally from other commercial banks, credit unions, farm credit associations, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, and consumer finance companies. In addition, competition for business in the Louisville and Lexington metropolitan areas has grown in recent years as changes in banking law have allowed banks to enter those markets by establishing new branches.\nCompetition in the banking industry may also limit the ability to attract and retain banking clients. The Bank maintains smaller staffs of associates and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which it competes. Financial institutions that have far greater resources and greater efficiencies than the Bank may have several marketplace advantages resulting from their ability to:\n\u25cf\noffer higher interest rates on deposits and lower interest rates on loans than the Bank can;\n\u25cf\noffer a broader range of services than the Bank does;\n\u25cf\nmaintain more branch locations than the Bank does; and\n\u25cf\nmount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nIn addition, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and other financial intermediaries may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions and may have larger lending limits. Some of the Company\u2019s current commercial banking clients may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than the Bank can accommodate. If the Bank is unable to attract and retain customers, it may not be able to maintain growth and the results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted.\nThe Company depends on its senior management team, and the unexpected loss of one or more of the senior executives could impair relationships with customers and adversely affect business and financial results.\nFuture success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of key management personnel. Future performance will depend on the ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the policies of bank regulatory agencies have placed restrictions on executive compensation practices. Such restrictions and standards may further impact the ability to compete for talent with other businesses that are not subject to the same limitations. The loss of the services of members of senior management or other key officers or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm its business.\nAccounting Estimates, Internal Controls, Cybersecurity\nReported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nAccounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to the reported financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner in which to report the financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These accounting policies include the valuation of securities, allowance for loan losses, valuation of OREO, and valuation of net deferred income tax asset. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required, among other things, to recognize other-than-temporary impairment on securities, significantly increase the allowance for credit losses, sustain credit losses that are higher than the reserve provided, recognize impairment on OREO, or permanently impair deferred tax assets.\nWhile management continually monitors and improves the system of internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate wide processes and procedures, the Company may suffer losses from operational risk in the future.\nManagement maintains internal operational controls and has invested in technology to help process large volumes of transactions. However, the Company may not be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions. If systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected, if systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls, significant losses could occur.\nThe Company processes large volumes of transactions on a daily basis exposing it to numerous types of operational risk, which could cause it to incur substantial losses. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nThe Company establishes and maintains systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about its level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost effective levels. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed. Nevertheless, the Company experiences loss from operational risk from time to time, including the effects of operational errors, and these losses may be substantial.\nInformation systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nFailure in or breach of operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt the Bank\u2019s businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase costs, and cause losses. As a financial institution, the Bank depends on its ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Business, financial, accounting, data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond the Bank\u2019s control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although the Bank has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, its business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to its physical infrastructure or operating systems that support its businesses and customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As noted above, the Bank\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in its computer systems and networks. In addition, to access the Bank\u2019s products and services, its customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PC\u2019s, and other mobile devices that are beyond its control systems. Although the Bank believes it has appropriate information security procedures and controls, its technologies, systems, networks, and its customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches. These events could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of the Bank\u2019s customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary, and other information or that of its customers, or otherwise disrupt the business operations of the Bank, its customers, or other third parties.\nThird parties with which the Bank does business or that facilitate its business activities could also be sources of operational and information security risk to the Bank, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although to date the Bank has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, the Bank can give no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. Risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and the prevalence of Internet and mobile banking. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Bank may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support the Bank\u2019s businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems, or devices that the Bank\u2019s customers use to access its products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect the Bank\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nBank Regulation\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and, as a result, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect financial performance and ability to implement growth and operating strategies.\nThe Company is subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies, as described under \u201cItem 1 - Business-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d Regulatory oversight of banks is primarily intended to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. Compliance with these regulations is costly and may make it more difficult to operate profitably.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations govern numerous matters including the payment of dividends, the acquisition of other banks, and the establishment of new banking offices. The Company must also meet specific regulatory capital requirements. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and policies or to maintain required capital could affect the ability to pay dividends on common shares, the ability to grow through the development of new offices, make acquisitions, and remain independent. These limitations may prevent the Company from successfully implementing growth and operating strategies.\nIn addition, the laws and regulations applicable to banks could change at any time, which could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business and profitability. For example, new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which the Company may conduct its business, including its ability to attract deposits and make loans. Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy or insolvency of a prominent U.S. corporation, can cause legislators and banking regulators and other agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Changes in regulation may cause the Company to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance, which may negatively affect operating results.\nChanges in banking laws could have a material adverse effect.\nThe Bank is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations, and governmental economic and monetary policies. Management cannot predict whether any of these changes could adversely and materially affect us. The current regulatory environment for financial institutions entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs. Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums, and limitations on the Bank\u2019s activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability.", "PERMNO": 91472, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "LMST"}
