{"cik": "1495231", "company": "IZEA Worldwide, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the factors discussed under this item regarding the numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment. These risk factors may not identify all risks that we face, and our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of annual net losses, expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations for most periods since our inception, which has resulted in a total accumulated deficit of $70,634,776 as of December 31, 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $10,250,007, including a $10,233,703 loss from operations. We have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. Therefore, we may need to raise capital through new financings, which could include equity financing, such as additional issuances of common stock under our at the market offering program, which may be dilutive to stockholders, or debt financing, which would likely restrict our ability to borrow from other sources. In addition, securities we issue may contain rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our current stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail or reduce our operations or forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets. An inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors.\nOur business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in the future.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As the disease spread throughout the United States, we directed all of our staff to work from home effective March 16, 2020 and subsequently did not renew leases for our headquarters and temporary office spaces to reduce fixed costs. We intend to have all employees work remotely for the foreseeable future to protect their health and safety. We believe our business operations and ability to support our customers are fully functional while our employees are working from remote locations; however, their productivity and efficiency may be negatively affected, and we may face increased risk of interruptions. Although countries have begun to distribute vaccinations, many countries face challenges in doing so and new variants of COVID-19 have been identified, and it is uncertain how quickly and effectively such vaccinations will help to control the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, there remains uncertainty around the duration and the total economic impact of the pandemic.\nOur business relies heavily on people, and adverse events such as health-related concerns and changes in family working conditions experienced by our employees, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment have impacted our business near term. We have changed the way we interact with our customers and pivoted to provide alternative forms of advertising for our customer campaigns as large social gatherings were cancelled during the year. The economic conditions caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted the business activity of our customers, and we have observed declining demand and changes in their advertising decisions, timing, and spending priorities, which have had a negative impact to our sales. We cannot fully quantify the impact to our business operations as a result of COVID-19 at this time. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nThe outbreak and attempts to slow the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and future trends remain uncertain. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of additional risks to our business, including weakened demand from our customers and delays in client payments.\nWe have not extended our monthly arrangements for flexible office space in our remote offices, nor signed a new lease for our headquarters, which could negatively impact our business.\nIn light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of the COVID-19 - specifically stay-at-home orders imposed by certain states and localities - we did not enter into a new lease for our corporate headquarters in Winter Park, Florida and our Canadian headquarters in Toronto, Canada, for which both leases expired on April 30, 2020. Additionally, we have vacated the various co-working facilities our team members used around the country as their terms expired during 2020. As a result, our management team and all of our employees are working remotely. While our employees are accustomed to working with other remote employees and customers, our workforce had not been fully remote prior to March 16, 2020, when we proactively instituted a work-from-home policy in response to COVID-19 concerns. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current plans as more information and guidance become available, not doing business in-person could negatively impact our marketing efforts, challenge our ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner, give rise to cybersecurity issues, slow down our recruiting efforts, or create operational or other challenges as we adjust to a fully-remote workforce, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, when we determine it prudent to end or modify our work-from-home policy, we will consider entering into a new lease for office space and/or arrangements for the use of co-working facilities. Although we believe suitable office space will be readily available when this time comes, we may encounter difficulties or delays in finalizing the terms of such lease arrangements or in obtaining rent prices at acceptable rates.\nImpairment of our intangible assets has resulted in significant charges that adversely impact our operating results.\nWe assess the potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In March 2020, we identified a triggering event due to the reduction in projected revenue related to COVID-19 and the continuation of a market capitalization below our carrying value and uncertainty for recovery given the volatility of the capital markets surrounding COVID-19. We performed an interim assessment of goodwill and determined that the carrying value of the Company\u2019s reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 exceeded the fair value. Therefore, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in further impairment charges that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nWe make numerous estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies and these estimates create complexity in our accounting. If our accounting is erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could change from investor expectations, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, judgments related to revenue recognition, stock based compensation, credit risk, and values surrounding software development, intangible assets and goodwill, and their economic useful lives.\nVarious factors contribute to complexity in our accounting. For example, the recognition of our revenue is governed by certain criteria that determine whether we report revenue either on a gross basis, as a principal, or net basis, as an agent, depending upon the nature of the sales transaction. Changes in how we control and manage our platforms, our contractual terms, our business practices, or other changes in accounting standards or interpretations, may change the reporting of our revenue on a gross to net or net to gross basis. As a result, we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenue depending on the nature of our sales and our reporting of such revenue and related accounting treatment, without any change in our underlying business or net income. Our guidance or estimates about the combination of gross or net revenue are based upon the volumes and characteristics that we believe will be the mix of revenue during the period. Those estimates and assumptions may be inaccurate when made or may be rendered inaccurate by subsequent changes in circumstances, such as changing the characteristics of our offerings or particular transactions in response to client demands, market developments, regulatory pressures, acquisitions, and other factors. In addition, we may incorrectly extrapolate from revenue recognition treatment of prior transactions to future transactions that we believe are similar, but that ultimately are determined to have different characteristics that dictate different revenue reporting treatment. These factors may make our financial reporting more complex and difficult for investors to understand, may make comparison of our results of operations to prior periods or other companies more difficult, may make it more difficult for us to give accurate guidance, and could increase the potential for reporting errors.\nFurther, our acquisitions have imposed purchase accounting requirements, required us to integrate accounting personnel, systems, and processes, necessitated various consolidation and elimination adjustments, and imposed additional filing and audit requirements. Ongoing evolution of our business, changes in underlying GAAP and any future acquisitions, will compound these complexities. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we make accounting errors or our judgments prove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below investor expectations or guidance we may have provided, resulting in a decline in our stock price and potential legal claims.\nHistorically, we have not relied upon patents to protect our proprietary technology, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services, which would harm our competitive position.\nOur success depends upon our proprietary technology. We do not have registered patents on any of our current platforms because we have determined that the costs of patent prosecution outweigh the benefits given the alternative of reliance upon copyright law to protect our computer code and other proprietary technology and properties. In addition to copyright laws, we rely upon service mark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or develop similar technology independently. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others, and we cannot assure you that that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that our proprietary rights with respect to our products or services will be viable or have value in the future since the validity, enforceability, and type of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, it may result in costly litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim our current or future products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could cause costly litigation that could consume significant management time. As the number of product and services offerings in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap, companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and could divert management's attention from operating our business. These claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If required, we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements, or obtain them on terms acceptable to us.\nFurther, in recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly in the software and Internet-related industries. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nIntense competition in our target markets could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability.\nThe market for influencer and content marketing is highly competitive. We expect this competition to continue to increase, in part because there are no significant barriers to entry to our industry for those that operate in a Managed Services or an agency-type model. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for managed campaigns, reduced margins and reduced revenue as a result of lost market share. Our principal competitors include other companies that provide marketers with Internet advertising solutions and companies that offer pay per click search services.\nWithin the enterprise software unit of IZEA\u2019s business (\u201cSaaS Services\u201d), while there is a higher technological barrier to entry, IZEA is vulnerable to new entrants with access to fresh capital and the ability to replicate upon previous research and development investments made by us. This is particularly challenging given the minimal opportunity to protect our internet-based software via patents.\nWe also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print for a share of marketers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully. If we fail to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nIn addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of other media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nWe are continuing to develop our IZEAx platform and have transitioned certain features and customers from our legacy Ebyline and TapInfluence platforms. Our updated IZEAx, Shake, and BrandGraph platforms may not achieve sufficient market acceptance to be commercially viable for open marketplace or SaaS services.\nIn April 2019, we released version 3.0 of IZEAx, which allows marketers to make offers that require a single creator to complete multiple tasks or deliverables. Throughout the remainder of 2019, we continued to add additional features to support our SaaS partners and integrate the Ebyline and TapInfluence platform offerings for custom content services within our IZEAx platform. By the end of 2019, nearly all of the Ebyline and TapInfluence customers and creators were migrated off of those platforms and onto the IZEAx platform. With the merging of the two platforms into IZEAx there is a risk of decreased revenue from marketers if they do not understand the changes or do not believe that the IZEAx platform can provide them with a similar or improved service from what they received in the Ebyline or TapInfluence platforms. If our marketers and creators do not perceive this platform to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to retain them or acquire new marketers and creators.\nShake and BrandGraph were both officially launched in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to invest significant engineering resources into the development and improvement of these platforms and the creation of new technology additions that complement our core offerings. The Shake and BrandGraph platforms and models are new to IZEA and we are still in the very early days of building a customer base for these products. We may fail to achieve significant marketplace inventory in Shake to attract enough buyers and we may fail to create enough product differentiation among social data platforms to drive adoption of BrandGraph. We cannot provide any assurances of the short or long-term commercial success or growth of our platforms. There is no assurance that the amount of money being allocated for the platforms will be sufficient to complete them, or that such completion will result in a competitive edge, significant revenues or profit for us.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain customers that are prepared to offer products or services on compelling terms through IZEAx and Shake. Additionally, we rely on marketers who purchase direct custom content from our creators in our platforms. We must continue to attract and retain customers in order to increase revenue and achieve profitability. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over this platform, demand for our platforms may decrease. In addition, we may experience attrition in our customers in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors, mergers, closures or bankruptcies. If we are unable to attract new customers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if too many customers are unwilling to offer products or services with compelling terms to our creators through our platforms, of if creators stop offering their services through our platform, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur total number of user accounts may be higher than the number of our actual individual marketers or creators and may not be representative of the number of persons who are active users.\nOur total number of user accounts in the IZEAx and Shake platform may be higher than the number of our actual individual marketers and creators because some may have created multiple accounts for different purposes, including different user connections. We define a user connection as a social account or blog that has been added to IZEAx and Shake under a user account. It is possible for one user to add as many user connections as they like, and it is common for talent mangers and large publishers to add several connections under a single account. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these creators, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual individual creators, and thus we rely on the number of total user connections and user accounts as our measure of the size of our user base. In addition, the number of user accounts includes the total number of individuals that have completed registration through a specific date, less individuals who have unsubscribed, and should not be considered as representative of the number of persons who continue to actively create to fulfill the sponsorships offered through our platforms. Many users may create an account but may not actively participate in marketplace activities.\nDelays in releasing enhanced versions of our products and services could adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to periodically release enhanced versions of IZEAx and related services. Even if our new versions contain the features and functionality our customers want, in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new product releases, our competitive position may be harmed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products in a timely and efficient manner. Due to the complexity of\nthese products, internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre-commercial releases may reveal product performance issues, undesirable feature enhancements or additional desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these new versions. In addition, the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products. Any delay in releasing other future products or enhancements of our products could cause our financial results to be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third-party social media platforms to provide the mechanism necessary to deliver influencer marketing, and any change in the platform terms, costs, availability, or access to these technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube to serve as the mechanism for publishing influencer marketing content to targeted audiences, in order to deliver our influencer marketing services to our customers. These platforms include technologies that provide some of the core functionality required to operate the influencer marketing portion of our platform, as well as functionalities such as user traffic reporting, ad-serving, content delivery services, discovering services, and metrics. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to make all or any of their technologies available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Third-party social media platforms may start charging fees or otherwise change their business models in a manner that impedes our ability to use their technologies. In any event, we have no control over these companies or their decision-making with respect to granting us access to their social media platforms or providing us with analytical data, and any material change in the current terms, costs, availability or use of their social media platforms or analytical data could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and by our customers and their end users. Internet access providers or distributors may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to our content, which could lead to additional expenses to us and our customers and the loss of end users and advertisers.\nProducts and services such as ours depend on our ability and the ability of our customers' users to access the Internet. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have, or in the future may have, significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers may take, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to products or services such as ours by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate product or service offerings such as ours, or by charging increased fees to businesses such as ours to provide content or to have users access that content. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) released an order, commonly referred to as net neutrality, that, among other things, prohibited (i) the impairment or degradation of lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application or service and (ii) the practice of favoring some Internet traffic over other Internet traffic based on the payment of higher fees. In December 2017, the FCC voted to overturn the net neutrality regulations imposed by the 2015 order. Internet service providers in the U.S. may now be able to impair or degrade the use of, or increase the cost of using, our products or services. Such interference could result in a loss of existing viewers, subscribers and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new viewers, subscribers and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in unanticipated losses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because a portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the value of foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, affect our results of operations and financial position. With respect to international sales initially priced using U.S. dollars as a cost basis, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would make our products less price competitive. Once the product is sold at a fixed foreign currency price, we could experience foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material effect on our operating results.\nNew tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of social media and our services, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our creators to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over social media. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of\ndoing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over social media. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data, and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nAs described in the section \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation,\u201d we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally and certain laws or regulations directly applicable to service providers for advertising and marketing Internet commerce. Due to the increasing popularity and use of social media, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to social media covering issues such as:\n\u2022truth-in-advertising;\n\u2022user privacy;\n\u2022taxation;\n\u2022right to access personal information;\n\u2022copyrights;\n\u2022distribution; and\n\u2022characteristics and quality of services.\nThe applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property, encryption, taxation, libel and export or import matters to social media platforms is uncertain. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of social media platforms and related technologies. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of social media and related technologies. Changes to these laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed changes, could create uncertainty in the social media marketplace. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs.\nOur influencer marketing business is subject to the risks associated with word of mouth advertising and endorsements, such as violations of \u201ctruth-in-advertising\u201d laws, the FTC Endorsement Guide and other similar global regulatory requirements and, more generally, loss of consumer confidence.\nAs the practice of targeted advertising is increasingly scrutinized by both regulators and the industry alike, a greater emphasis has been placed on educating consumers about their privacy choices on the Internet, and providing them with the right to opt in or opt out of targeted advertising. The common thread throughout both targeted advertising and the FTC requirements described in detail in the section \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d is the increased importance placed on transparency between the marketer and the consumer to ensure that consumers know the difference between \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cadvertising\u201d on the Internet, and are afforded the opportunity to decide how their personal information will be used in the manner to which they are marketed. There is a risk regarding negative consumer perception of the practice of \u201cundisclosed compensation\u201d of social media users to endorse specific products. As described in the section \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation,\u201d we undertake various measures through controls across our platforms and by monitoring and enforcing our code of ethics to ensure that marketers and creators comply with the FTC's Endorsement Guide (and analogous laws and guidance in other countries) when utilizing our websites, but if competitors and other companies do not, it could create a negative overall perception for the industry. Not only will readers stop relying on blogs for useful, timely and insightful information that enrich their lives by having access to up-to-the-minute information that often bears different perspectives and philosophies, but a lack of compliance will almost inevitably result in greater governmental oversight and involvement in an already-highly regulated marketplace. A pervasive overall negative perception caused by a failure of our own preventative measures or by others not complying with the FTC's Endorsement Guide (among the FTC's other acts, regulations and policies, and among analogous laws and guidance in other countries,) could result in reduced revenue and results of operations and higher compliance costs for us.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information (\u201cPrivacy Laws\u201d). Privacy Laws are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. The European Union adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, and requires companies to satisfy stricter requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its collection, use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. EU Member States also are enacting national GDPR-implementing laws that are in some cases stricter or different from GDPR. During 2018, Brazil enacted a law similar to GDPR and other countries are expanding or considering their Privacy Laws to follow suit. Complying with these new and expanded Privacy Laws will cause us to incur substantial operational costs or may require us to change our business practices. For example, noncompliance with the GDPR could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenues as well as damage to our reputation and brand. We also may find it necessary to establish systems to effectuate cross-border personal data transfers of personal information originating from the European Economic Area, Australia, Japan and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business.\nWe have made public certain statements about our privacy practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of creators' personal information on our websites and platforms. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their public-facing privacy notices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our public-facing privacy notices, FTC requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental or other entities or the incurring by us of other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of creators or marketers and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications of targeted advertising, such as the use of cookies and other tracking technology. The regulation of these cookies and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we receive unfavorable media coverage, our ability to expand our base of creators and marketers will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the \u201cIZEA\u201d brand is critical to expanding our base of creators and marketers. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote, maintain, and protect the \u201cIZEA\u201d brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our platforms, applications, practices or service offerings, or the offerings of our marketers, could adversely affect our reputation, resulting in difficulties in recruiting, decreased revenue and a negative impact on the number of marketers and the size of our creator base, the loyalty of our creators and the number and variety of sponsorships we offer each day. As a result, our business, prospects, results of operation, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our platforms and applications, and any significant disruption in service on our platforms and applications could result in a loss of creators or marketers.\nCreators and marketers access our services through our platforms and applications. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain, and serve our creators and marketers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platforms and applications and the underlying network infrastructure. If our creator base continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts for data centers and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our platforms and applications. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures. In the event that our creator base or the amount of traffic on our platforms and applications grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or\nelectronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our platforms and applications, and prevent our creators and marketers from accessing our services. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is hosted by third-party providers. Any disruption in these services or any failure of these providers to handle existing or increased traffic could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. If we do not maintain or expand our network infrastructure successfully or if we experience operational failures, we could lose current and potential creators and marketers or transactions between the two groups, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our platforms, our platforms and applications may be perceived as not being secure, marketers and creators may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur platforms and applications and the network infrastructure that is hosted by third-party providers involve the storage and transmission of marketer and creator proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, security flaws in the third-party hosting service that we rely upon or any number of other reasons and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our marketers' or creators' data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, marketers or creators to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our marketers' or creators' data. Although we do have security measures in place, we have had instances where some customers have used fraudulent credit cards in order to pay for our services. While these breaches of our security did not result in material harm to our business, any future breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our platforms and applications that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain and use unauthorized credit cards, obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose marketers, creators, and vendors and have difficulty obtaining merchant processors or insurance coverage essential for our operations.\nIf our technology platforms contain defects, we may need to suspend their availability and our business and reputation would be harmed.\nPlatforms as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. Many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial release of new platforms or enhancements to existing platforms. Although we attempt to resolve all defects that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before making our platforms available to them, our products are not defect-free. We may not be able to detect and correct defects before releasing our product commercially. We cannot ensure that undetected defects or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known defects, considered minor by us, will not result in serious issues for our customers. Any such defects or performance problems may be considered serious by our customers, resulting in a decrease in our revenues.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits for information by our marketers and our creators, which may affect our business.\nLaws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their marketers or of their social media creators and for the content of their marketers' listings are currently unsettled. It is unclear whether we could be subjected to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories relating to the information we publish on our websites or the information that is published across our platforms. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services and print publications in the past. We may not successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by our marketers or our creators. Our potential liability for unlawful activities of our marketers or our creators or for the content of our marketers' listings could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, which may require us, among other things, to spend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims and the defense of such claims may divert the attention of our management from our operations. If we are subjected to such lawsuits, it may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to detect click-fraud or other invalid clicks, we could lose the confidence of our marketers and advertising partners as a result of lost revenue to marketers or misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, thereby causing our business to suffer.\n\u201cClick-fraud\u201d is a form of online fraud when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user by intentionally clicking on an advertisement for the purpose of generating a charge per click without having an actual interest in the target of the advertisement's link. We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or illegitimate clicks on our sponsored listings. The security measures we have in place, which are designed to reduce the likelihood of click-fraud, detect click-fraud from time to time. Although the instances of click-fraud that we have detected to date have not had a material effect on our business, click-fraud could result in a marketer experiencing a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs because the fraudulent clicks will not lead to revenue for the marketers. As a result, our marketers and advertising partners may become dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of marketers, advertising partners, and revenue. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches. Concerns over the security of the Internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also deter people from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information.\nThe influencer and content marketing industry is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our products and services.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality, and reliability of our products and services. The influencer and content marketing industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete. In the past, we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging industry standards, we may not be able to increase our revenue and expand our business.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Edward H. Murphy, our Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan S. Schram, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Murphy, who is our founder, has unique knowledge regarding the influencer marketing space, business contacts, and system design and development expertise regarding our platforms that would be difficult to replace. Mr. Schram has sales, marketing, and business development expertise that our other officers do not possess. Even though we have employment agreements in place with each of them, if Messrs. Murphy and Schram were to become unavailable to us, our operations would be adversely affected. Although we maintain \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance for our benefit on the lives of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Schram, this insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for the loss of our executive officers.\nOur future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified engineers, sales and marketing and senior management personnel. Competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them, particularly in the Orlando, Florida area where our headquarters are located. We have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Failure to attract, assimilate and retain personnel, including key management, technical, sales and marketing personnel, would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult and costly for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be delisted if we fail to maintain compliance with the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). To maintain this listing, we must satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per share for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \"Bid Price Rule\").\nOn November 12, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq informing us that for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share. This notice had no immediate effect on our Nasdaq listing, and we had 180 calendar days, or until May 11, 2021, to regain compliance.\nOn January 6, 2021, we received notification from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule after the closing bid price of our common stock was at $1.00 per share or greater for the prior 10 consecutive business days.\nAlthough we are now in compliance with the Bid Price Rule, if we fail to meet this or any of the other continued listing requirements in the future, our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock materially and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees, and business development opportunities. Such a delisting likely would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock may no longer be recognized as a \u201ccovered security\u201d and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Thus, delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly impact the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe have raised, and may raise, additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses until we are able to significantly grow our revenues. From 2019 to 2020, we incurred a year-over-year decrease in revenue. If our annual revenue does not increase, we may need additional financing to maintain and expand our business. This financing may be obtained through our at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program under the sales agreement, dated January 25, 2021, with National Securities Corporation acting as sales agent, pursuant to which we may sell common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $35,000,000. Any additional capital raised through our at-the-market equity offering program or any other financing involving the sale of equity or equity linked securities may dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.\nThe terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses, and other costs. We may be required to bear the costs even if we are unable to successfully complete any such capital financing. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible promissory notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nExercises of stock options, warrants, and other securities will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had 59,129,390 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which included 37,620 shares of unvested restricted stock, outstanding stock options to purchase 1,742,303 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $2.55 per share, and unvested restricted stock units of 569,934 shares with an intrinsic value of $2,308,233.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we also have reserved shares to issue stock options, restricted stock or other awards to purchase or receive up to 3,651,597 shares of common stock under our May 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, 4,375 shares of common stock under our August 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, and 395,613 shares of common stock under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan. In the future, we may grant these additional shares or issue new securities, in accordance with terms defined in employment agreements or as part of additional incentive programs. The exercise, conversion or exchange by holders of stock options, restricted stock units, or warrants for shares of common stock, or the issuance of new shares of common stock for additional compensation will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders. Issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. No person is under any obligation to publish research or reports on us, and any person publishing research or reports on us may discontinue doing so at any time without notice. If adequate research coverage is not maintained on our company or if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or provide relatively more favorable recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analysts who cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other political conditions may cause a downturn in the market for our products or services. A future downturn in the market for our products or services could adversely affect our operating results and increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Our future operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated marketers and creators; our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and services on a timely basis; changes in the mix of products developed, produced and sold; disputes with our marketers and creators; and general economic conditions causing a reduction in spending by our customers. These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our quarterly and/or annual operating results. The change in our earnings or general economic conditions may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nThe price of our common stock in the public markets has experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme volatility due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nSince our common stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has been relatively thinly traded and at times been subject to price volatility. Recently our common stock has experienced extreme price and volume volatility. From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, the closing price of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.13 on March 18, 2020 to a high of $2.82 on June 11, 2020, with an average daily trading volume of 6.7 million shares. On January 25, 2021, the price increased to an intraday high of $7.45 per share and 25,323,000 shares were traded. Otherwise, in January 2021 the closing price of our common stock averaged $3.65 with an average daily trading volume of 8.9 million shares and, in February 2021, the closing price of our common stock averaged $4.70 with an average daily trading volume of 4.0 million shares.\nIn addition to shares of our common stock, the stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. As a result, the market price could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022changes in our industry;\n\u2022competitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022limited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market prices of our common stock;\n\u2022speculative trading practices of certain market participants;\n\u2022actual or purported \u201cshort squeeze\u201d trading activity;\n\u2022expiration of any Rule 144 holding periods or registration of unregistered securities issued by us;\n\u2022sales of our common stock;\n\u2022our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u2022loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u2022regulatory developments; and\n\u2022economic and other external factors, including effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nFurther, on some occasions, our stock price may be, or may be purported to be, subject to \u201cshort squeeze\u201d activity. A \u201cshort squeeze\u201d is a technical market condition that occurs when the price of a stock increases substantially, forcing market participants who had taken a position that its price would fall (i.e. who had sold the stock \u201cshort\u201d), to buy it, which in turn may create significant, short-term demand for the stock not for fundamental reasons, but rather due to the need for such market participants to acquire the stock in order to forestall the risk of even greater losses. A \u201cshort squeeze\u201d condition in the market for a stock can lead to short-term conditions involving very high volatility and trading that may or may not track fundamental valuation models.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.", "PERMNO": 15943, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "IZEA"}
