{"cik": "860748", "company": "KEMPER Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nKemper is exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The following discussion details the significant risk factors that are specific to the Company. In addition to those described below, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by other factors not presently known by, or considered material to, the Company. Readers are advised to consider all of these factors along with the other information included in this 2014 Annual Report, and to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.\nChanges in the application of state unclaimed property laws and related insurance claims handling practices, particularly attempts by state officials to apply such changes retroactively to existing insurance policies through new laws and regulations, examinations and audits, could result in new requirements that would have a significant effect on (including an acceleration of) the payment and/or escheatment of life insurance death benefits and significantly increase claims handling costs relative to what is currently contemplated by Kemper. If attempts by state officials to impose such new requirements on existing insurance policies are successful on a wide scale, there is a potential for their collective effects to be materially adverse to the Company\u2019s profitability, financial position and cash flows (the \u201cUnclaimed Property Risk Factor\u201d).\nIn recent years, many states have begun to aggressively expand the application of their unclaimed property laws as they relate to life insurance proceeds. The treasurers or controllers (collectively, \u201cTreasurers\u201d) of a large majority of states have engaged private audit firms to examine the practices and procedures of life insurance companies with respect to the reporting and remittance of proceeds associated with life insurance policies, annuity contracts and retained asset accounts under state unclaimed property laws. Certain related measures are also being taken or considered by state insurance regulators, both individually and collectively through the auspices of the NAIC. Some state insurance regulators have initiated market conduct examinations focused on claims handling and escheatment practices of life insurance companies.\nAs a result of these audits and examinations, a number of large life insurance companies have agreed to alter historic practices that were previously considered to be lawful and appropriate relative to claims handling and the reporting and remittance of life insurance policy proceeds to the states under state unclaimed property laws. Based on published reports, at least sixteen life insurance companies have entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators and twenty-one with Treasurers. Under the terms of these agreements, the settling insurance companies typically have agreed to establish a practice of periodically searching for deceased insureds, even prior to the receipt of a death claim, by comparing their in-force policy records against a database of reported deaths maintained by the Social Security Administration or a comparable database (collectively, a \u201cDeath Master File\u201d or \u201cDMF\u201d). The settlements typically apply to policies that were in force at any time since January 1, 1992. In conducting these data comparisons against a Death Master File, the insurers are required to use complex \u201cfuzzy\u201d matching criteria which in many cases result in numerous potential matches for any given insured. In such cases, the insurer must either assume a costly and administratively burdensome process of disproving any such ambiguous matches which may, in some cases, necessitate a review of older records that are not in electronic form or accept such matches as valid and escheat the related policy benefits to the states if the beneficiaries cannot be found. All settlements to date with insurance regulators have involved payment of monetary penalties (involving amounts ranging from about $1.2 million up to $40 million), while settlements with Treasurers have required payment of interest on sums remitted to the Treasurers dating from the date of death of the insured (rather than from a more recent date linked to the insurer\u2019s first awareness of death) and extending as far back as January 1, 1995. As hereafter described, Kemper\u2019s life insurance subsidiaries (the \u201cLife Companies\u201d) have thus far resisted attempts by certain state officials and their agents to mandate changes to the Life Companies\u2019 claims handling and escheatment practices of the sort embodied in the foregoing settlements and have challenged through legal proceedings the authority of such officials to require such changes. There can be no assurances that the Life Companies will ultimately be successful in resisting such attempts or any that may arise in the future.\nSeparately, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (\u201cNCOIL\u201d) has adopted model legislation which, if enacted by states as proposed, would require life insurance companies to compare their in-force life insurance policy records against a Death Master File for the purpose of proactively identifying potentially deceased insureds for whom the subject life insurance company has not yet received a claim, including due proof of death. Ten states have enacted legislation of this type, with varying effective dates (the \u201cDMF Statutes\u201d). Such statutes, if construed to apply to life insurance policies in force on each respective statute\u2019s effective date, could have a significant effect on, including an acceleration of, the payment of life insurance benefits to beneficiaries or, in instances where beneficiaries could not be located, the remittance of such benefits to the states under their unclaimed property laws. In contrast, New Mexico and Tennessee have enacted a version of the model legislation that applies only prospectively to life insurance companies, like Kemper\u2019s Life Companies, that have not previously used a Death Master File. Similarly, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama have enacted statutes that apply only to policies issued on or after their respective effective dates, without regard to prior Death Master File use. Various forms of DMF legislation are pending in several states, and Kemper believes that it is likely that a number of other states will introduce (or re-introduce) legislation of this sort in 2015. Kemper cannot presently predict whether any of such pending or future legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, exactly what form such legislation will take.\nIn November 2012, certain of the Life Companies filed a declaratory judgment action in Kentucky state court challenging the Kentucky DMF Statute on statutory and constitutional grounds, insofar as it purports to impose new requirements with respect to existing, previously issued life insurance policies. The trial court in that case denied the subject Life Companies\u2019 motion for summary judgment and held that the requirements of the Kentucky DMF Statute apply to life insurance policies issued before the Kentucky DMF Statute\u2019s January 1, 2013 effective date. The Life Companies appealed the trial court decision to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and in August 2014, in a unanimous opinion, the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and held that the Kentucky DMF statute fell within Kentucky\u2019s statutory presumption against retroactivity. As a result, the Court ruled, the Kentucky DMF Statute can only apply to policies issued on and after January 1, 2013. In September 2014, the Kentucky Department of Insurance filed a motion asking for the Kentucky Supreme Court to undertake a discretionary review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling. A decision by the Kentucky Supreme Court on whether to review the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision is expected by the third quarter of 2015.\nIn July 2013, certain of the Life Companies filed a declaratory judgment action, similar to the Kentucky action, in Maryland state court asking the court to construe the Maryland DMF Statute to apply only prospectively, i.e., only with respect to those life insurance policies issued in Maryland on or after the effective date of the Maryland DMF Statute, consistent with what the Life Companies believe are the requirements of the Maryland Constitution and the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. The Maryland Insurance Administration filed a motion to dismiss the action on jurisdictional grounds, contending that the Life Companies failed to first exhaust their administrative remedies before filing their action in the trial court. In March 2014, the trial court granted the Maryland Insurance Administration\u2019s motion. The Life Companies appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. The Maryland appellate courts have declined to stay enforcement of the Maryland DMF Statute pending the appeal, and the Life Companies are complying with the Maryland DMF Statute while they\ncontinue to pursue their appeal. The Life Companies\u2019 appeal was heard by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals in December 2014. The parties are awaiting the court\u2019s decision.\nIn August 2014, certain of the Life Companies filed a declaratory judgment action in Indiana state court, asking the court to construe the Indiana DMF Statute to apply only prospectively, i.e., only with respect to those life insurance policies issued in Indiana on or after the effective date of the Indiana DMF Statute, consistent with what the Life Companies believe are the requirements of applicable Indiana statutory law, the Indiana Constitution and the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. The Indiana Department of Insurance filed an answer in response to the subject Life Companies\u2019 complaint in October 2014, and the Life Companies filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2015. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for May 2015.\nThe Life Companies are the subject of an unclaimed property compliance audit (the \u201cTreasurers\u2019 Audit\u201d) by a private audit firm retained by the Treasurers of 38 states (the \u201cAudit Firm\u201d). In July 2013, the California State Controller (the \u201cCA Controller\u201d) filed a complaint for injunctive relief against the Life Companies in state court in California, seeking an order requiring the Life Companies to produce all of their in-force insurance policy records to the Audit Firm to enable the firm to perform a comparison of such records against a Death Master File and to ascertain whether any of the insureds under such policies may be deceased. In December 2013, the CA Controller filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking the same injunctive relief. A hearing on that motion has been continued until the California Court of Appeals rules on a preliminary injunction order issued in a related case involving an unaffiliated life insurance company, entitled Chiang v. American National Insurance Company (the \u201cANICO Appeal\u201d). The Life Companies have filed a cross-complaint in their case against the CA Controller, seeking a declaration that there is no obligation under California\u2019s unclaimed property law to perform a Death Master File comparison and that the Audit Firm cannot obtain the Life Companies\u2019 records for the purpose of performing such a comparison. The CA Controller has filed a motion to dismiss the Life Companies\u2019 cross-complaint, contending that the Life Companies\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment of their rights and obligations under California\u2019s unclaimed property law is premature and not ripe for adjudication. A hearing on that motion has also been continued by the court until the Court of Appeals issues its decision in the ANICO Appeal. In July 2014, the court granted a motion by the CA Controller to stay the litigation in its entirety, including all discovery, pending a decision by the Court of Appeals in the ANICO Appeal. Oral argument in the ANICO Appeal has been scheduled for February 2015 with a decision likely by the end of the second quarter of 2015. The current stay of the CA Controller\u2019s case against the Life Companies means that no substantive ruling is likely to occur before late 2015. In related activity, the CA Controller\u2019s petition for coordination of the lawsuits pending in CA involving its unclaimed property audits of five life insurers, including the lawsuit against the Life Companies, seeking to have them all heard by the same court was denied in January 2015. Pending the outcome of this litigation, the Life Companies have not produced any of their in-force policy records to the CA Controller.\nThe Life Companies are the subject of a multi-state market conduct examination by five state insurance regulators, which examination is focused on the Life Companies\u2019 claim settlement and policy administration practices, and specifically their compliance with state unclaimed property statutes (the \u201cMulti-State Exam\u201d). In July 2013, the Life Companies received requests from the Illinois Department of Insurance, as the managing lead state for the Multi-State Exam, for a significant volume of information beyond that which the Life Companies had already produced, including all of the subject Life Companies\u2019 records of in-force policies and other information of the type requested by the Audit Firm as part of the Treasurers\u2019 Audit and which is the subject of the CA Controller\u2019s complaint. This request prompted the Illinois litigation noted below. In August 2014, the Illinois Department of Insurance appointed a law firm to act as an additional examiner in the Multi-State Exam, which remains ongoing.\nIn September 2013, certain of the Life Companies filed declaratory judgment actions against the insurance regulators in four states participating in the Multi-State Exam (Illinois, California, Pennsylvania and Florida), asking the courts in those states to declare that applicable insurance laws do not require life insurers to search a Death Master File to ascertain whether insureds are deceased, and to further declare that the regulators in those states do not have legal authority to (i) obtain life insurers\u2019 policy records for the purpose of comparing data from those records against a Death Master File, and/or (ii) impose payment obligations on life insurers before a claim and due proof of death have been submitted by policy beneficiaries. In response to the Illinois declaratory judgment action, the Illinois Department of Insurance and its Director (collectively, the \u201cIDOI\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss, and in July 2014, the court in Illinois denied, in part, such motion. Specifically, the court allowed to stand the count in the Life Companies\u2019 complaint that the IDOI cannot compel the Life Companies to provide their policy records to the IDOI or persons acting on the IDOI\u2019s behalf so as to permit a comparison against the DMF for purposes of identifying deceased insureds, as well as the associated claim for injunctive relief. The court dismissed with prejudice the other counts in the complaint. In August 2014, the IDOI filed its answer to the counts of the complaint that the Illinois court allowed to stand, and in October 2014, the Life Companies filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to those remaining counts. The\nIDOI filed cross motions for summary judgment in December 2014. Formal briefing and a hearing schedule on the summary judgment motions are expected to be set by the court at a May 2015 status conference. The Life Companies\u2019 actions against regulators in Pennsylvania and Florida are currently stayed by agreement of the parties pending the outcome of the Illinois action. The action against regulators in California, which was filed as part of a counterclaim in the CA Controller litigation, is stayed as described above.\nShould these various efforts by state officials succeed in retroactively imposing new claims handling and escheatment requirements with regard to previously issued life insurance policies, such requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability, financial position and cash flows. The Company\u2019s stance in opposition to the aforementioned actions by state legislators, Treasurers and insurance regulators, including the Life Company\u2019s initiation of the litigation described above, also creates a risk of reputational damage to the Company among various constituencies (including its principal insurance regulators, rating agencies, investors, insurance agents and policyholders), particularly if the Company\u2019s position is not ultimately vindicated.\nSee Note 22, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the sections of the MD&A entitled \u201cLife & Health Insurance\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information on the legal proceedings, including lawsuits, regulatory examinations and inquiries, and other matters described above.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and emerging practices in the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate under an extensive insurance regulatory system. Current laws and regulations encompass a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, market conduct, trade practices, claims practices, reserve and loss ratio requirements, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, restrictions on the payment of dividends, approvals of transactions involving a change in control of one or more insurance companies, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy. They also require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports and reports on holding company issues and other matters. Pre-approval requirements restrict the companies from implementing premium rate changes for property, casualty and health insurance policies, introducing new, or making changes to existing, policy forms and many other actions. Insurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries and can suspend or delay their operations or licenses, require corrective actions, and impose penalties or other remedies available for compliance failures. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries and these new developments, see \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese laws and regulations, and their interpretation by the various regulators and courts, are undergoing continual revision and expansion. The legal and regulatory landscape within which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues may emerge. These emerging practices, conditions and issues could adversely affect Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways, including, for example, by expansion of coverages beyond their underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims or accelerating the payment of claims. Industry practices that were considered approved or legally-compliant and reasonable for years may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of an unexpected court or regulatory ruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. One example is the changing application by various state officials of state unclaimed property laws and related claims handling practices that is discussed in the preceding risk factor. Anticipating such shifts in the law and the impact they may have on the Company and its operations is a difficult task and there can be no assurances that the Company will not encounter such shifts in the future.\nThe financial market turmoil has resulted in additional scrutiny and proposed regulation of the financial services industry, including insurance companies and their holding company systems. While it is not possible to predict how new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may impact the operations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, several recent developments have the potential to significantly impact such operations. This includes state adoption of extensive modifications to the IHCS that will, among other things, substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators beyond licensed insurance companies to their non-insurance affiliates and impose new reporting requirements with respect to, among other things, enterprise risk to the organization as a whole, affiliated transactions, and any divestiture of controlling interests in an insurer. In addition, federal legislation has resulted in regulations affecting health insurers under the Health Care Acts, and potential changes to the state insurance regulatory system may result from the DFA. See the discussion of the NAIC model act and the DFA under \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese new developments and significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to conduct and grow their businesses.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable and, in particular, the phenomenon of runaway jury verdicts could result in one or more unexpected verdicts against the Company that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nKemper and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of their businesses. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to Kemper or one or more of its subsidiaries, while others may pertain to business practices in the industry in which Kemper and its subsidiaries operate. Some lawsuits may seek class action status that, if granted, could expose the Company to potentially significant liability by virtue of the size of the putative classes. These matters raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. A further complication is that even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is deemed to be remote using traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes can and do substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which the Company operates, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nFor information about the Company\u2019s pending litigation, see Note 22, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition, the availability of reinsurance and the ratings of Kemper and its insurance subsidiaries.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and wildfires and may include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and hazardous material spills. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may be impacted by the uncertain effects of climate change. The extent of the Company\u2019s losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the geographic area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The Company could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.\nKemper\u2019s life and health insurance subsidiaries are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as pandemic or other events that result in large numbers of deaths. In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on the Company\u2019s workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate.\nThe Company uses catastrophe modeling tools developed by third parties to project its potential exposure to catastrophic events under various scenarios. Such models are based on various assumptions and judgments which may turn out to be wrong. The actual impact of one or more catastrophic events could adversely and materially differ from these projections.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Reinsurance does not relieve Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries of their direct liability to their policyholders. As long as the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. While the Company\u2019s principal reinsurers are each rated \u201cA-\u201d or better by A.M. Best at the time reinsurance is purchased, the Company cannot be certain that reinsurers will pay the amounts due from them either now, in the future, or on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control determine the availability of the reinsurance protection that Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may purchase. A decrease in the amount of reinsurance protection that Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries purchase generally should increase their risk of a more severe loss. However, if the amount of available reinsurance is reduced, Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect the ability of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to write future insurance policies or result in their retaining more risk with respect to such policies.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries also manage their exposure to catastrophe losses through underwriting strategies such as reducing exposures in, or withdrawing from, catastrophe-prone areas, establishing appropriate guidelines for insurable structures, and setting appropriate rates, deductibles, exclusions and policy limits. The extent to which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries can manage their exposure through such strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action. For example, laws\nand regulations may limit the rate or timing at which insurers may non-renew insurance policies in catastrophe-prone areas or require insurers to participate in wind pools and joint underwriting associations. Generally, an insurer\u2019s participation in such pools and associations are based on the insurer\u2019s market share determined on a state-wide basis. Accordingly, even though Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may not incur a direct insured loss as a result of managing direct catastrophe exposures, they may incur indirect losses from required participation in pools and associations. Laws and regulations requiring prior approval of policy forms and premium rates may limit the ability of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to increase rates or deductibles on a timely basis, which may result in additional losses or lower returns than otherwise would have occurred in an unregulated market. See the risk factor above under the title \u201cKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and emerging practices in the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\u201d\nIf the catastrophic risk retained by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries increases, rating agencies may downgrade the ratings of Kemper and/or its insurance subsidiaries or require Kemper to retain more capital in its insurance businesses to maintain existing ratings. See the risk factor below under the title \u201cA significant downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company.\u201d\nA significant downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries could adversely and materially affect the Company.\nThird-party rating agencies assess the financial strength and rate the claims-paying ability of insurance companies based on criteria established by the rating agencies. Third-party ratings are important competitive factors in the insurance industry. Financial strength ratings are used to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. A significant downgrade by A.M. Best in the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, particularly those operating in the preferred and standard market or offering homeowners insurance, could result in a substantial loss of business if agents or policyholders of such subsidiaries move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. Any substantial loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of such subsidiaries. A downgrade in Kemper\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) may reduce Kemper\u2019s ability to access the capital markets for general corporate purposes or refinance existing debt.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance businesses face significant competition, and their ability to compete is affected by a variety of issues relative to others in the industry, such as product pricing, service quality, financial strength and name recognition. Competitive success is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nCompetitiveness of prices charged for insurance policies;\n\u2022\nSophistication of pricing segmentation;\n\u2022\nSelection of agents and other business partners;\n\u2022\nCompensation paid to agents;\n\u2022\nUnderwriting discipline;\n\u2022\nSelectiveness of sales markets;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of marketing materials and name recognition;\n\u2022\nProduct and technological innovation;\n\u2022\nAbility to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims;\n\u2022\nAbility to control operating expenses;\n\u2022\nFinancial strength ratings; and\n\u2022\nQuality of services provided to, and ease of doing business with, agents and policyholders.\nThe inability to compete effectively in any of the Company\u2019s insurance businesses could materially reduce the Company\u2019s customer base and revenues and could adversely affect the future results and financial condition of the Company.\nSee \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 7 and page 10, for more information on the competitive rankings in the property and casualty insurance markets and the life and health insurance markets, respectively, in the United States.\nReserve National\u2019s operating history with its expanded distribution channels and new products is limited.\nReserve National\u2019s business model, which has traditionally focused on providing limited benefit and supplemental accident and health insurance coverages to persons who lack access to traditional private options, was adversely affected by the Health Care Acts. In response, Reserve National has adapted its business model by placing emphasis on designing and selling supplemental health insurance products that are not expected to be as severely impacted by the Health Care Acts and ceasing to issue health\ninsurance products that are more severely impacted. Because Reserve National\u2019s operating history with respect to some of these supplemental health insurance products is limited, it supplements its data with industry data and experience in determining rates to charge for these products and projecting returns. It will take several years to develop company-specific experience. Reserve National\u2019s actual experience could adversely and materially differ from the data and experience on which assumptions and projections are based.\nReserve National has expanded its distribution channels over the past two years, launching Kemper Senior Solutions and Kemper Benefits. Kemper Senior Solutions markets small face value, or final expense, life insurance and home health care products focusing on the individual senior age demographic of the market place. Kemper Benefits sells voluntary supplemental insurance products in the employer marketplace. Brokers and non-exclusive independent agents are utilized to market and distribute products in these new distribution channels. Reserve National appointed approximately 20,000 independent agents during the past two years in connection with these initiatives. Reserve National has limited history on how some of its products will perform using these distribution channels. It will take several years to determine if actual performance meets, exceeds or is below expectations. If performance is below expectations, Reserve National\u2019s financial position, returns and valuation could be adversely and materially impacted for many years due to the long-term nature of some of the products sold through these distribution channels.\nFailure to maintain the security of personal data and the availability of critical systems may result in lost business, reputational harm, and legal costs and regulatory penalties.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries obtain and store vast amounts of personal data that can present significant risks to the Company and its customers and employees. An increasing array of laws and regulations govern the use and storage of such data, including, for example, social security numbers, credit card data and personal health information. The Company\u2019s data systems are vulnerable to security breaches due to the sophistication of cyber-attacks, viruses, malware, hackers and other external hazards, as well as inadvertent errors, equipment and system failures, and employee misconduct. The Company also relies on the ability of its business partners to maintain secure systems and processes that comply with legal requirements and protect personal data. These increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements related to personal data security expose the Company to potential data loss and resulting damages, reputational risk and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs. In the event of non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM and point-of-sale cards, such organizations could prevent Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries from collecting premium payments from customers by way of such cards and impose significant fines on Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations rely on the continuous availability of its computer systems. In addition to disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or other data breaches, such systems may be adversely affected by natural and man-made catastrophes. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain business continuity in the wake of such events may prevent the timely completion of critical processes across its operations, including, for example, insurance policy administration, claims processing, billing, treasury and investment operations and payroll. These failures could result in significant loss of business, fines and litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses.\nThe Company maintains a diversified investment portfolio that is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, including interest rate (risk-free and spread), equity price, and liquidity, as well as risks from changes in tax laws and regulations and other risks from changes in general economic conditions.\nThe interest rate environment has a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and position. In recent years, rates have been at or near historic lows. A protracted low interest rate environment would continue to place pressure on net investment income, particularly related to fixed income securities, short-term investments and limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting (\u201cEquity Method Limited Liability Investments\u201d) that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt of other companies. A decline in interest rates would generally increase the carrying value of the Company\u2019s fixed income securities and its Equity Method Limited Liability Investments that exhibit debt-like characteristics, but it may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s investment income as it invests cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio\u2019s average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may seek to refinance their borrowings at lower rates and, accordingly, prepay or redeem securities the Company holds as investments more quickly than the Company initially expected. Such prepayment or redemption action may cause the Company to reinvest the redeemed proceeds in lower yielding investments. An increase in interest rates would generally reduce the carrying value of a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, particularly fixed income securities and Equity Method Limited Liability Investments, which typically provide higher returns but at a higher risk.\nThe Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities, which generally have more volatile returns than fixed income securities and may experience sustained periods of depressed values. There are multiple factors that could negatively impact the performance of the Company\u2019s equity portfolio, including general economic conditions, industry or sector deterioration and issuer-specific concerns. A decline in equity values may result in a decrease in dividend income, realized losses upon sales of the securities, or other-than-temporary impairment charges on securities still held.\nInterest rates and equity returns also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement employee benefit plans. In addition to the impact on carrying values and yields of the underlying assets of the funded plans, interest rates also impact the discounting of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations of the plans. A decrease in interest rates may have a negative impact on the funded status of the plans.\nThe nature and cash flow needs of the Company and the insurance industry in general present certain liquidity risks that may impact the return of the investment portfolio. If the Company were to experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments to claimants, which could result in realized losses. Additionally, increases in illiquidity in the financial markets may increase uncertainty in the valuations of the Company\u2019s investments. This increases the risk that the fair values reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual price that may be obtained in an orderly sales transaction.\nThe Company has also benefited from certain tax laws related to its investment portfolio, including dividends received deductions and tax-exempt municipal securities. Changes in tax laws may have a detrimental effect on the after-tax return of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s entire investment portfolio is subject to broad risks inherent in the financial markets, including, but not limited to, inflation, regulatory changes, inactive capital markets, governmental and social stability, economic outlooks, unemployment and recession. Changes to these risks and how the market perceives them may impact the financial performance of the Company\u2019s investments.\nKemper and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to various risk rating and capital adequacy measurements that are significantly impacted by various characteristics of their invested assets, including, but not limited to, asset type, class and credit rating. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to various limitations on the amounts at which they can invest in individual assets or certain asset classes in the aggregate. Asset risk is one factor used by insurance regulators and rating agencies to determine required capital for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, a deterioration in the quality of the investments held by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries or an increase in the investment risk inherent in their investment portfolios could increase capital requirements. See risk factor below under the title \u201cKemper relies on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock.\u201d These factors may inhibit the Company from shifting its investment mix to produce higher returns. The Company is also subject to concentration of investment risk to the extent that the portfolio is heavily invested, at any particular time, in specific asset types, classes, industries, sectors or collateral types, among other defining features. Developments and the market\u2019s perception thereof in any of these concentrations may exacerbate the negative effects on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio compared to other companies.\nEstimating losses and LAE for determining property and casualty insurance reserves, or determining premium rates, is inherently uncertain, and the Company\u2019s results of operations may be materially impacted if the Company\u2019s insurance reserves or premium rates are insufficient.\nThe Company establishes loss and LAE reserves to cover estimated liabilities, which remain unpaid as of the end of each accounting period, and to investigate and settle all claims incurred under the property and casualty insurance policies that it has issued. Loss and LAE reserves are established for claims that have been reported to the Company as of the end of the accounting period, as well as for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The estimates of loss and LAE reserves are based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, as well as estimates of the impact of future trends in the severity of claims, the frequency of claims and other factors. See MD&A, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates,\u201d under the caption \u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d beginning on page 53 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company\u2019s actuaries in estimating the Company\u2019s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves.\nThe process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves is complex and imprecise. The reserves established by the Company are inherently uncertain estimates and could prove to be inadequate to cover its ultimate losses and expenses for insured events that have occurred. The estimate of the ultimate cost of claims for insured events that have occurred must take\ninto consideration many factors that are dependent on the outcome of future events associated with the reporting, investigation and settlement of claims. The impacts on the Company\u2019s estimates of property and casualty insurance reserves from these factors are difficult to assess accurately. A change in any one or more of the factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate loss that is different than the previous projected ultimate loss and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s estimate of the projected ultimate loss. Increases in the estimates of ultimate losses and LAE will decrease earnings, while decreases in such estimates will increase earnings, as reported by the Company in the results of its operations for the periods in which the changes to the estimates are made by the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s actuaries also consider trends in the severity and frequency of claims and other factors when determining the premium rates to charge for its property and casualty insurance products. An unanticipated change in any one or more of these factors or trends, as well as a change in competitive conditions, may also result in inadequate premium rates charged for insurance policies issued by Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in the future. Such pricing inadequacies could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nKemper relies on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock.\nAs a holding company with no business operations of its own, Kemper depends on the dividend income that it receives from its subsidiaries as the primary source of funds to pay interest and principal on its outstanding debt obligations, to pay dividends to its shareholders and to make repurchases of its stock. Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. In addition, third-party rating agencies monitor statutory capital and surplus levels for capital adequacy. Even though a dividend may be payable without regulatory approval, an insurance subsidiary may forgo paying a dividend to Kemper and retain the capital in its insurance subsidiaries to maintain or improve the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. The inability of one or more of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper\u2019s ability to pay its debt obligations on time, to pay dividends to its shareholders or make repurchases of its stock.\nManaging technology initiatives to address business developments and regulatory requirements present significant challenges to the Company.\nWhile technological developments can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses and implementation schedules may be inaccurate and can escalate over time, while the ultimate utility of a technology initiative could deteriorate over time. The financial services industry is highly regulated, and the Company faces rising costs and competing time constraints in adapting technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations.", "PERMNO": 76136, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "KMPR"}
