RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to general and industry-specific economic factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations, profitability and cash flow.\nOur business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have little control, that include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of qualified drivers;\n\u2022\naccess to the credit and capital markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations concerning production, shipment, storage or disposal of material we transport, depot or dispose;\n\u2022\nincreases in fuel prices, taxes and tolls;\n\u2022\nincreases in costs of equipment;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, natural gas prices, oil prices and currencies;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity in the chemical logistics, energy logistics and intermodal industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations or changes in license and regulatory fees;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions at U.S. ports of entry;\n\u2022\ndownturns in customers\u2019 business cycles; and\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 shipping requirements.\nAs a result, we may experience periods of overcapacity, driver shortages, declining prices, lower profit margins and less availability of cash in the future. We have a large number of customers in the chemical processing, oil, gas, and consumer goods industries. If these customers experience fluctuations in their business activity due to an economic downturn, work stoppages, commodity price changes or other industry conditions, transportation and other services provided by us on behalf of those customers may decrease. The volume of shipments of chemical products is affected by many other industries and end-use markets. Natural gas and oil drilling are affected by the market prices for those commodities. There is also no assurance our strategic initiatives will be successful or that the assumptions driving such initiatives, including, for example, anticipated growth in chemical production, will come to fruition.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe loan agreement (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) governing both our $350.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL\u201d) and our $17.5 million senior secured FILO term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and the indentures governing our 9.875% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the \u201c2018 Notes\u201d) contain covenants that limit or prohibit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\nredeem, repurchase, make payments on or retire subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets, including stock, of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our independent affiliates.\nThese covenants may prohibit or impair us from taking actions that we believe are best for our business. Furthermore, under the ABL Facility, we may be required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not meet those ratios. In addition, covenants in our debt agreements limit our use of proceeds from our ordinary operations and from extraordinary transactions. These limits may require us to apply proceeds in a certain manner or prohibit us from utilizing the proceeds in the manner we believe most beneficial.\nA failure to comply with any of the covenants contained in the ABL Facility or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default, the lenders of the defaulted indebtedness:\n\u2022\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us under the ABL Facility;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due immediately and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or\n\u2022\ncould require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nSuch actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts under the ABL Facility, the lenders under the ABL Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nWe had consolidated indebtedness and capital lease obligations, including current maturities of $351.3 million, as of December 31, 2014. We must make regular payments under the ABL Facility, including the Term Loan, thereunder, and our capital leases and semi-annual interest payments under our 2018 Notes.\nOur 2018 Notes issued in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 carry high fixed rates of interest. In addition, interest on amounts borrowed under our ABL Facility, including the Term Loan, is variable and will increase as market rates of interest increase. We do not presently hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. Our higher interest expense may reduce our future profitability. Our future higher interest expense and future redemption obligations could have other important consequences with respect to our ability to manage our business successfully, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations for our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with these obligations could result in an event of default;\n\u2022\nit will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other business activities;\n\u2022\nit increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nit limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nit limits our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nThe ABL will mature at the earlier of November 2019 and the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the Company\u2019s currently outstanding 2018 Notes or any replacement notes if the outstanding amount of such debt is above a certain threshold. The Term Loan matures on November 3, 2017 but we are subject to mandatory prepayment of the principal amount of the Term Loan in equal quarterly payments beginning as early as November 2015. The maturity date of the ABL Facility, including the Term Loan, may be accelerated if we default on our obligations. If the maturity of the ABL Facility and/or such other debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the ABL Facility and/or such other debt or be able to refinance the ABL Facility and/or such other debt on acceptable terms, or at all. The failure to repay or refinance the ABL Facility and/or such other debt at maturity would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, would cause substantial liquidity problems and may result in the bankruptcy of us and/or our subsidiaries. Any actual or potential bankruptcy or liquidity crisis may materially harm our relationships with our customers, suppliers and independent affiliates.\nOur ability to satisfy our interest and principal payment obligations will depend upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nour future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by many factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nour future ability to borrow under the ABL Facility, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the ABL Facility.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we may not be able to draw under the ABL, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness or fund our operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we are not able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise capital on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or for sufficient proceeds, we could default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may incur significantly more indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe ABL Facility and the indentures governing the 2018 Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. We had $62.0 million available for additional borrowing under the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2014, including a subfacility for letters of credit, subject to customary conditions, including borrowing base availability, and the covenants under our debt agreements would allow us to borrow a significant amount of indebtedness beyond this amount. Additional leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and could increase the risks described in \u201cOur debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business,\u201d and \u201cWe have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to make required payments on our indebtedness.\u201d\nStock repurchases under our share repurchase program will diminish our cash resources, may not enhance shareholder value and could adversely affect trading in our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to $15.0 million in shares of our common stock. As of March 9, 2015, we have repurchased approximately $8.5 million of our common stock under this program. Any further repurchases under the program would diminish our cash resources and increase our leverage, which could impact our ability to reduce our indebtedness or pursue other business opportunities that may be more valuable to our shareholders. There is no assurance that we would be able to replenish our cash resources in the future. Share repurchases may not enhance shareholder value as the price of our common stock may decline below our repurchase prices, or the repurchase prices may exceed the intrinsic value of our assets or business. The current share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, does not obligate us to acquire a particular number of shares, and may be discontinued at any time; however, the Board of Directors may elect to increase share repurchase programs in the future. Any discontinuation of or limited repurchases under our program could negatively impact our stock price. Any repurchases would reduce the number of shares available for the public to trade, which could diminish trading volumes, increase the price volatility of our common stock and reduce our equity.\nThe trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented.\nThe trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented. No single carrier in the chemical logistics or energy logistics business has a significant market share. We compete with many other carriers of varying sizes, customers\u2019 private fleets, railroads and, in the energy logistics market, with pipelines, all of which may limit our growth opportunities and reduce profitability. Historically, competition has created downward pressure on the trucking industry\u2019s pricing structure. Some trucking companies with which we compete have greater financial resources than we do.\nWe believe that the most significant competitive factor that impacts demand for our services is rates, and depending on our competitors\u2019 pricing decisions, we may be forced to lower our rates, which would reduce our profitability. In fact, certain markets that we serve have experienced significant price competition in recent years. With respect to certain aspects of our business, we also compete with intermodal transportation, pipelines and railroads. Intermodal transportation has increased in recent years. Growth in such forms of transport could adversely affect our market share, net sales and profit margins. Competition from non-trucking modes of transportation and from intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal fuel taxes or other regulatory costs for trucking were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes or regulation imposed upon other modes of transportation.\nAdditional trends include current and anticipated consolidation among our competitors which may put downward pressure on pricing. Some of our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do. As a result, those competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within our industry and in the economy as a whole. If we do not compete successfully, our operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur reliance upon independent affiliates and independent owner-operators could adversely affect customer relationships, our operations and our financial performance.\nWe rely heavily upon independent affiliates and independent owner-operators to perform the services for which we contract with our customers. We believe that our independent affiliate and independent owner-operator relationships can facilitate our financial and operational goals. However, there can be no assurance that the structure will accomplish the goals for which it was created, and our reliance upon independent affiliates and independent owner-operators creates numerous risks for our business. In addition, while certain of these risks are shared characteristics of both independent affiliates and independent owner-operators, the degree of these risks may differ between the two and certain risks may be characteristic of only one.\nWe contract with our customers to perform the services provided by our businesses. If our independent affiliates or independent owner-operators fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise fail to perform in a manner consistent with our requirements, we may be required to utilize alternative service providers at potentially higher prices or with some degree of disruption of the services that we provide to our customers. If we fail to deliver on time, if our contractual obligations are not otherwise met, or if the costs of our services increase, then our profitability and customer relationships could be harmed.\nThe financial condition and operating costs of our independent affiliates and independent owner-operators are affected by conditions and events that are beyond our control and may also be beyond their control. Adverse changes in the financial condition of our independent affiliates and independent owner-operators or increases in their equipment or operating costs could cause them to seek higher revenues or to cease their business relationships with us. The prices we charge our customers could be impacted by such issues, which may in turn limit our pricing flexibility with customers, resulting in fewer customer contracts and decreasing our revenues.\nAlthough our independent affiliates have substantial contractual obligations to us, we do not control them. Independent affiliates may take actions that maximize their short-term profits or other interests even if they are detrimental to us. Due to their importance in our operations, we have loaned money to, facilitated certain tractor leases for and entered into other financing arrangements with certain independent affiliates and may do so again. The inability of our independent affiliates to satisfy their obligations to us could result in accounting charges and losses that materially adversely affect our results of operations. We have in certain instances acquired the operations of underperforming independent affiliates and could again in the future. While these acquisitions seek to preserve our customer relationships and the scope of our operations, there is no assurance that they will succeed in doing so. Further, any such acquisition could require the use of liquidity sources, capital investment and management attention and could materially impact our profitability, cash flows and business.\nIndependent affiliates and independent owner-operators typically utilize tractors, trailers and other equipment bearing our tradenames and trademarks. If one of our independent affiliates or independent owner-operators is subject to negative publicity, it could reflect on us and have a material adverse effect on our business, brand and financial performance. Under certain laws, we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of our independent affiliates or independent owner-operators.\nCompetition for qualified independent owner-operators is substantial, and currently and otherwise from time to time there are shortages of available qualified independent owner-operators. Shortages can result from causes beyond our control or from contractual terms or company policies that make contracting with us less desirable to certain owner-operators. Due to the absence of long-term contracts, independent owner-operators can quickly terminate their relationships with us. We may have insufficient driver capacity to meet the needs of our customers and be forced to forego business that would otherwise be available to us. Driver shortages may decrease our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe maintain equipment leasing programs with third party vendors that could increase our costs and adversely impact our business if we are required to provide contractually mandated financial support for a significant amount of repossessed equipment.\nWe maintain agreements with various third-party equipment financing companies to establish leasing programs to facilitate equipment acquisitions by our independent contractors. These agreements provide, in part, that we will provide remarketing support as well as, in many cases, defined levels of financial support with respect to equipment under those leasing programs that are repossessed by those equipment financing companies. If repossessions under those programs are significant and we are not able to mitigate our required support levels through established means, the costs of our obligations under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position.\nReclassification of our independent contractors, such as our independent owner-operators, as employees could increase our costs and adversely impact our business.\nWe use a significant number of independent contractors, such as our independent owner-operators, in all three segments of our business, consistent with long-standing industry practices. Regulatory authorities and private parties have recently asserted within the trucking industry that some independent contractors should be classified as employees based upon their interpretations of existing rules and regulations. Legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities could also introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the classification of a significant number of independent contractors doing business with us from independent contractor to an employee. The costs associated with reclassification, including any related regulatory action or litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position.\nThe loss of qualified drivers or other personnel could limit our growth and negatively affect operations.\nDuring periods of high trucking volumes, there is substantial competition for qualified drivers in the trucking industry. Regulatory requirements, including electronic logging, and an improvement in the economy could reduce the number of eligible drivers. Furthermore, certain geographic areas have a greater shortage of qualified drivers than other areas. We operate in many of the geographic areas where there have been driver shortages in the past and have turned down new business opportunities as a result of the lack of qualified new drivers. Our voluntary implementation of ELDs prior to implementation of the regulatory requirement resulted in greater driver turnover in 2011 and 2012 and lower revenues in our chemical segment, and could become an on-going competitive disadvantage until our competitors are compelled to implement ELDs as we anticipate. Difficulty in attracting qualified personnel, particularly qualified drivers, could require us to increase driver compensation, forego available customer opportunities and underutilize the tractors and trailers in our network. These actions could result in increased costs and decreased revenues. In addition, we may not be able to recruit other qualified personnel in the future.\nChanges in UCO&G exploration, development and production in the U.S. impact the demand for the services of our energy logistics business.\nOur energy logistics business serves customers in the energy market in numerous shale regions in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas may cause them to curtail spending, and reduce demand for our services, particularly services we provide related to oil and gas exploration activities. Customers may also curtail activity in the U.S. due to the relative costs and stability of non-U.S. oil and gas fields or due to U.S. regulation. Hydraulic fracturing is under significant legislative and regulatory scrutiny and the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state or local level could adversely affect our customers\u2019 UCO&G operations. Even if new laws or regulations are not implemented, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could reduce demand for UCO&G activity in the U.S. Market prices and these other factors may lead to curtailed activity for a sustained period of time.\nIn the past, frac shale drilling activity has shifted among U.S. shales as the relative prices of oil and gas make drilling for one commodity more profitable than another. Oil or gas drilling may shift away from the shale regions in which we have operations for reasons over which we have no control, such as relative commodity prices, resource discovery, new pipeline access, transportation constraints, proximity to end-users, local drilling costs, state regulation or weather conditions. While certain business assets may be redistributed among shales, assets such as terminals, disposal wells and certain customer contracts are specific to discrete shale regions. Even business assets that may be redistributed or repositioned may require time and expenditures for conversion to different shale regions or for a different service.\nIn the energy logistics market, we have experienced and expect to continue to face adverse consequences from the cyclical nature of the energy industry. Slowdowns in exploration and production activity have caused and may continue to cause a decline in the demand for our services in the affected regions where we operate, the price of our services and our asset utilization. A shift away from or slowdown in drilling in the shales in which we have operations could also result in asset-related impairment charges and decreased revenues. Any of these effects could in turn adversely affect our operating margins, financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nWe are self-insured and/or have deductible exposure to certain claims and are subject to the fluctuation of the insurance marketplace, all of which could affect our profitability.\nThe primary accident risks associated with our business are:\n\u2022\nmotor-vehicle related bodily injury and property damage;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation claims;\n\u2022\nenvironmental pollution liability claims;\n\u2022\ncargo loss and damage; and\n\u2022\ngeneral liability claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance for:\n\u2022\nmotor vehicle related third-party bodily injury and property damage claims, covering all employees, independent owner operators and independent affiliates;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage on our employees;\n\u2022\nenvironmental pollution liability claims; and\n\u2022\ngeneral liability claims.\nOur insurance program includes a self-insured deductible of $2.0 million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and a $1.0 million deductible for workers\u2019 compensation. In addition, we currently maintain insurance policies with a total limit of $65.0 million, of which $60.0 million is provided under umbrella and excess liability policies and $5.0 million is provided under a primary liability policy. The $2.0 million deductible per incident could adversely affect our profitability, particularly in the event of an increase in the frequency or severity of incidents. Additionally, we are self-insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease, as well as for cargo losses and such self-insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation. We extend insurance coverage to our independent affiliates and independent owner-operators for (i) motor vehicle related bodily injury, (ii) motor vehicle related property damage, and (iii) cargo loss and damage. Under this extended coverage, independent affiliates and independent owner-operators are responsible for only a small portion of the applicable deductibles. In addition, even where we have insurance, our insurance policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities.\nWe are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and we cannot assure you that the cost or availability of various types of insurance may not change dramatically in the future. To the extent these costs cannot be passed on to our customers in increased prices, increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability and cash flow.\nThe trucking industry is subject to regulation, and changes in trucking regulations may increase costs.\nAs a motor carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FMCSA and the DOT, and by various federal, state, and provincial agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing various aspects such as operating authority, safety, hours of service, hazardous materials transportation, financial reporting and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment, product-handling requirements and drug testing of drivers. Any downgrade in our DOT safety rating (as a result of the new CSA regulations described below or otherwise) could adversely affect our business.\nThe trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices, emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing trucking services. Possible changes include:\n\u2022\nincreasingly stringent environmental regulations, including changes intended to address climate change;\n\u2022\nrestrictions, taxes or other controls on emissions;\n\u2022\nregulation specific to the energy market and logistics providers to the industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in the hours-of-service regulations, which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period;\n\u2022\ndriver and vehicle electronic logging requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirements leading to accelerated purchases of new trailers;\n\u2022\nmandatory limits on vehicle weight and size;\n\u2022\ndriver hiring restrictions;\n\u2022\nincreased bonding or insurance requirements; and\n\u2022\nmandatory regulations imposed by the Department of Homeland Security.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels and emissions, which may increase our or our independent affiliates\u2019 operating costs, require capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers.\nRestrictions on emissions or other climate change laws or regulations could also affect our customers that use significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels in producing or delivering the products we carry. We also could lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions upon us or our customers in the energy logistics market.\nFrac shale drilling is under significant legislative, regulatory and public scrutiny. Legislation to modify the treatment of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act has been proposed in Congress, the EPA is studying the potential environmental impacts of frac shale drilling activities, and the U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed requiring companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations on public lands. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are reportedly considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict frac shale drilling and injection wells in certain circumstances, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on us or on our energy logistics market customers. For example, several states have adopted regulations requiring the permitting and bonding of injection wells, disclosure of fluids utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process, and reporting of disposal volumes.\nFuture U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations could significantly restrict, or increase costs associated with, hydraulic fracturing and make it more difficult or costly for producers to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, which could result in a decline in exploration and production. New laws and regulations, and new enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, could also expressly restrict the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal, including in injection wells, and otherwise increase our and our customers\u2019 costs of compliance, which could minimize water use and disposal needs even if other limits on drilling and completing new wells were not imposed. Any decline in exploration and production or any restrictions on water use and disposal could negatively impact our operation of disposal wells, result in a decline in demand for our energy logistics business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials, which could create environmental liabilities.\nOur activities, particularly those relating to our handling, transportation, storage and disposal of bulk chemicals, flowback and produced water and oil, are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulation by governmental authorities in the United States as well as foreign governmental authorities. Among other things, these environmental laws and regulations address emissions to the air, discharges onto land and into water, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws change frequently and generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits. Environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time, and most provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. Some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations. There can be no assurance that violations of such laws, regulations, permits or licenses will not be identified or occur in the future, or that such laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could impose material costs on us. Additionally, we have been, and may in the future be required to obtain financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, for environmental obligations.\nAs a handler of hazardous substances, we are potentially subject to strict joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of accidents, spills, leakage from injection wells and other environmental releases of these substances to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. We have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties for chemical, crude oil or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities or over the road. As a result of environmental studies conducted at our facilities or at third-party sites, we have identified environmental contamination at certain sites that will require remediation and we are currently conducting investigation and remediation projects at eight of our facilities. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased by us. Future liabilities and costs under environmental, health, and safety laws are not easily predicted, and such liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business reputation.\nIn addition, we have been named a potentially responsible party at various sites under the CERCLA and other environmental regulatory programs. Our current reserves provided for these sites may prove insufficient, which would result in future charges against earnings. Furthermore, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites could be material.\nPotential disruptions at U.S. ports of entry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny disruption of the delivery of intermodal ISO tank containers to those ports where we do business would reduce the number of intermodal tank containers that we transport, store, clean or maintain. This reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are generally outside our control. Political events as well as hurricanes and other weather-related events, and current and future legislation (such as market-based (cap-and-trade) greenhouse gas emissions control mechanisms) also may cause the price of fuel to increase. Because our operations and operations of our independent affiliates are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and operations and financial condition of our independent affiliates if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges. Historically, we have recovered the majority of the increases in fuel prices from chemical logistics and intermodal customers through fuel surcharges. However, most of our energy customer contracts do not have fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges that can be collected may not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel. To the extent fuel surcharges are insufficient to offset our or our independent affiliates\u2019 fuel costs or we are unable to continue passing on increased fuel costs to our customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThere are risks inherent in utilizing disposal wells and other disposal sites in our energy logistics business.\nRights to deposit flowback and/or production water in disposal wells and other disposal sites proximate to our shales are important to our energy logistics business. We currently achieve these rights in the various shales in which we operate through a variety of means including direct disposal well ownership or leasing rights, through contracts with third-party disposal wells, or on a spot basis from third-party disposal wells. Neither we nor the third-party disposal sites we utilize can fully control the performance of disposal wells. Even though a well is legally permitted to accept a certain amount of water, there is no assurance that the well or any specific zone in the well will be capable of absorbing an anticipated amount. Disposal wells may also be ruined or rendered unusable during operations due to technical or mechanical difficulties or natural disaster. Disposal wells can encounter problems that render the well unusable even after a period of successful operation. Further, we will be obligated to retire wells that we own following their productive use in compliance with applicable laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate or access any specific disposal well or other disposal site, or will be able to obtain sufficient well or other disposal site access to achieve efficient operation in any shale. There can be no assurance that our estimates of the useful lives and costs of retirement of wells that we own will prove accurate.\nOur business may be harmed by terrorist attacks, future wars or anti-terrorism measures.\nIn the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses. Such existing measures and future measures may have significant costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear. Moreover, large trucks carrying toxic chemicals and oil are potential terrorist targets, and we may be obligated to take measures, including possible capital expenditures intended to protect our trucks. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could continue to increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nIf our information technology and communications systems are disrupted, the disruption could impair our operations and harm our reputation among customers.\nWe rely heavily on information technology and communications systems to operate our business and manage our network in an efficient manner. We have equipped our drivers with various mobile communications systems and ELDs that enable us to monitor our tractors and communicate with our drivers in the field and enable customers to track the location and monitor the progress of their cargo through the Internet. Despite redundancies and security measures, our information technology and communications systems remain susceptible to outages, computer viruses, break-ins, human error, data leakage and other disruptions and imperfections. Any of these could impair the efficiency of our operations, inhibit our customer service or reduce customer access to information. In addition, there could be a loss of confidential information, corruption of data, or damage to our reputation. Demand for our services or the profitability of operations could in turn be affected, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe depend on members of our senior management.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team. If members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to potential asset impairment.\nAt December 31, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $50.3 million, or approximately 11.8% of our total assets and approximately 21.3% of our non-current assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. In addition, at December 31, 2014, net property and equipment totaled approximately $156.2 million, or approximately 36.5% of our total assets.\nWe review for potential goodwill impairment by reporting unit on an annual basis as part of our goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter of each year with a measurement date of June 30, and more often if a triggering event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.\nDuring 2013, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $91.3 million, of which $72.8 million related to goodwill and $18.5 million related to intangibles, all in our energy logistics reporting unit. This impairment testing utilized the same methodologies as in prior periods for our energy logistics reporting unit, but utilized updated assumptions reflecting updated market and segment operating conditions and results.\nIf there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values, if management\u2019s estimates of future operating results change, if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions, the estimated carrying values and the estimated fair value of our goodwill and long-lived assets could change significantly, and could result in future impairment charges, which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully realize all of the intended benefits from prior or future acquisitions and other transactions.\nWe may be unable to realize all of the intended benefits of any prior or future acquisitions. As part of our business strategy, we have previously acquired and continually evaluate acquisitions, including acquisitions leading to the creation of new independent affiliates. We cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified and acquired in the future, that the financing of any such acquisition will be available on satisfactory terms, that we will be able to complete any such acquisition or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition. Certain prior acquisitions have not produced results consistent with our expectations and future acquisitions may not be viewed positively by customers or achieve their intended benefits. We encounter various risks in acquiring other companies, including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations, diversion of management\u2019s attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities, or inefficiencies or difficulties that arise due to unfamiliarity with geographic areas that are new to us. We conduct due diligence investigations of the business operations of companies that we have acquired prior to consummating these acquisitions, but our due diligence investigations may not be sufficient to uncover all material information concerning such operations. As a result of such acquisitions, we may be held liable for risks and liabilities of which we are not aware at the present time. Any of these risks related to prior or future acquisitions, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased unionization could increase our operating costs or constrain operating flexibility.\nAlthough only approximately 3.4% of our driver population, including independent owner-operators and employees of independent affiliates, was subject to collective bargaining agreements at December 31, 2014, unions such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have traditionally been active in the U.S. trucking industry. Unionized workers could disrupt our operations by strike, work stoppage or other slowdown. In addition, our non-union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past, and we could be subject to future unionization. Increased unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.\nIf we withdraw from any of our multi-employer pension plans, we will be liable for a proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefit liabilities upon our withdrawal.\nBy their nature, multi-employer pension plans carry with them risks that differ from single-employer plans. We contribute to multi-employer pension and postretirement plans in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements. Other unrelated employers contribute to (or have contributed to) those multi-employer plans pursuant to their respective collective bargaining agreements. Assets contributed by an employer to a multi-employer pension plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to the employees of that contributing employer. If a participating employer to a multi-employer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, as has happened in the past and may happen in the future, the unfunded obligations of the plan, including obligations to former employees of the no longer-contributing employer, may be borne by the remaining participating employers, such as us. In the event of the termination of a multi-employer pension plan, union decertification, the mass withdrawal of other employers or if we withdraw from a multi-employer pension plan, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of such plan.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we contributed to three separate multi-employer pension plans for employees under collective bargaining agreements. All of these multi-employer pension plans, the Employer-Teamsters Local Nos. 175 & 505 Pension Trust Fund, the Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (\u201cCentral States Plan\u201d) and the New York State Teamsters Conference Pension and Retirement Fund, have been classified as carrying red zone status under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d), indicating that they are less than 65% funded.\nWe do not currently intend to withdraw from the three multi-employer pension plans or take any actions that would subject us to payment of contingent obligations upon withdrawal from such plans. However, the actions of others could trigger this withdrawal liability. Based on information provided to us from the trustees of these plans, we estimate our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from these plans to be approximately $90.9 million, of which $85.1 million relates to the Central States Plan. In the event that we were required to pay this unfunded liability, such payment, if it could be made at all, would have a material impact on our liquidity, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and Florida law may prevent a change in control of our Company that a shareholder may consider favorable.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and Florida law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to control a takeover attempt which the Board viewed unfavorably;\n\u2022\nelimination of the voting rights of shareholders with respect to shares that are acquired without prior Board approval that would otherwise entitle such shareholders to exercise certain amounts of voting power in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprohibition on business combinations with interested shareholders unless particular conditions are met.\nAs a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and result in dilution.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of March 9, 2015, there are approximately 28.1 million shares of common stock outstanding. Approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock, as of March 9, 2015, are \u201crestricted securities,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or are held by affiliates.\nIn addition, as of March 9, 2015, we have 1.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. As of March 9, 2015, there were outstanding options for approximately 1.1 million shares. Exercise of the options that are in-the-money will result in dilution to existing shareholders in an amount equal to the difference in the market and exercise prices multiplied by the number of shares exercised. In addition, prior to their exercise, these options may depress the market price for our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the ABL Facility and indentures governing our 2018 Notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order to realize a gain on one\u2019s investment. This may not occur.", "PERMNO": 89920, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "QLTY"}
