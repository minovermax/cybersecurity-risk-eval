RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our business. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and may continue to have, material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control.\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of COVID-19, which has resulted in related severe disruptions to retail operations and supply chains and the global economy overall. Governmental authorities across the globe have taken and continue to take dramatic actions to slow down the spread of the disease, at various levels and in different phases across regions. Although restrictions have been eased in many regions and all of our retail stores have reopened, we may be required to close stores again or adhere to increased operational restrictions including public health directives or quarantine policies. Even in the absence of stringent federal, state or local mandates, deterioration in discretionary consumer spending or social distancing measures may extend the duration of the adverse impact on retail traffic in our Company-operated or our customers\u2019 retail stores. The extent and magnitude that the impact of COVID-19 will continue to have on our business will depend on various factors, including its duration, severity and any resurgences.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our business has included, and may continue to include, the following:\n\u2022retail store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic;\n\u2022disruption to our distribution centers and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures;\n\u2022impacts to our distribution and logistics providers\u2019 ability to operate or increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and could result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses;\n\u2022additional expenses as we continue to implement safety measures and other precautions to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers in our retail stores or to comply with any applicable laws or governmental orders;\n\u2022significant disruption of global financial markets, which has increased the cost of accessing capital and could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future; and\n\u2022negative adverse impacts to the global economy, including decreases or shifts in consumer demand, spending and/or channel preferences.\nWe continue to experience delays in product and raw material availability due largely to global supply chain disruptions, driven in part by port congestion and transportation delays. We are working with our customers to minimize any impact, and have incurred transitory costs, including air freight to expedite shipments to meet customer demand, primarily during the second half of 2021.\nThe ultimate economic impact of the pandemic remains fluid, and there continue to be periods of COVID-19 resurgence in various parts of the world. Such future changes may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOur revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our business depends on consumer spending on apparel, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates, inflation, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions, energy prices, consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where our products are sold.\nThe current global economic environment is unpredictable, and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\n10 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\nSupply chain and shipping disruptions have resulted in shipping delays, a significant increase in transportation costs, and could increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply chain disruption and shipping disruptions, including disruptions or delays in loading container cargo in ports of origin or off-loading cargo at ports of destination, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, congestion in port terminal facilities, labor supply and shipping container shortages, inadequate equipment and persons to load, dock and offload container vessels and for other reasons. These disruptions have impacted our ability to receive materials or products from our third-party manufacturing partners and suppliers, to distribute our products to our customers in a cost-effective and timely manner and to meet customer demand, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, if we miss the delivery date requirements of our customers, they may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries, impose non-compliance charges, demand reduced prices, or reduce future orders, any of which could harm our sales and margins. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of these disruptions by working closely with our manufacturing partners, other vendors, and customers, there can be no assurances that further unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Additionally, the impacts that supply chain disruptions have on our manufacturers and suppliers are not within our control. It is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to cease or ease. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting us and our manufacturing partners and other vendors could interrupt product manufacturing, increase production lead times, increase raw material and product costs, impact our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets.\nWe compete with numerous apparel brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than us in certain product categories and regions. In addition, we compete directly with the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Our ability to compete within the apparel industry depends on our ability to:\n\u2022anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner;\n\u2022develop attractive, innovative and high-quality products that meet consumer needs;\n\u2022maintain strong brand recognition;\n\u2022price products appropriately;\n\u2022provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;\n\u2022ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;\n\u2022adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape;\n\u2022respond to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis; and\n\u2022obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail.\nFailure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail (e-commerce and retail store) channels. We may not be able to manage our brands within and across channels sufficiently, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions, and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers\u2019 orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs, the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers, which could have a negative impact on future sales, an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, higher costs for our freight or expedited shipments, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\n11 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the images of our brands.\nOur success to date has been due in large part to the growth of our brands\u2019 images and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, including customers\u2019 desire for sustainable products, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding us, our brands or our products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes, musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts. Actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations, which could adversely affect the images of our brands.\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nThe apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, rising commodity and conversion costs, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing. Customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe sell merchandise direct-to-consumer through our retail stores and e-commerce sites. Our direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside of our control, (ii) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (iii) credit card fraud and (iv) risks related to our direct-to-consumer distribution centers and processes. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include (i) diversion of sales from our wholesale customers, (ii) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, (iii) liability for online content, (iv) changing patterns of consumer behavior and (v) intense competition from online retailers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nThe retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect our business.\nRecently there have been consolidations, reorganizations, restructurings, bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry, much of which is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These events individually, and together, could have a material adverse effect on our business. These changes could impact our opportunities in the market and increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers. In the future, retailers are likely to further consolidate, undergo restructurings, reorganizations or bankruptcies, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets. In addition, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to us or an increase in leverage by our customers over their suppliers.\nFurther, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties, including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to us relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay us could substantially reduce our revenues and profits.\nA small portion of our customers account for a significant portion of net revenues. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 61% of total net revenues in 2021, and our top customer, Walmart, accounted for 34%, 38% and 34% of our total net revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future. Sales to our wholesale customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of our major wholesale customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us, cease its purchases from us, cancel its orders, reduce its advertising for our products or change its manner of doing business with us, whether motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive conditions, or otherwise, could substantially reduce net revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our larger customers generally have the scale to develop supply chains that enable them to change their buying patterns, or develop and market their own private label and other\n12 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\neconomy brands that compete with some of our products. This ability also makes it easier for them to resist our efforts to increase prices, reduce inventory levels and, potentially, discontinue our products. Many of our largest customers have already developed significant private label brands under which they design and market apparel and accessories that compete directly with our products. These retailers have assumed an increasing degree of inventory risk in their private label products and, as a result, may first cancel advance orders with us in order to manage their own inventory levels downward during periods of unseasonable weather or weak economic cycles. In addition, if any of our customers devote less selling space to our categories of apparel, our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business. Any such reduction in our categories of apparel selling space could result in lower sales, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, from time to time certain customers have experienced financial and operational difficulties. Our wholesale customers have experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including declines in retail traffic, inflationary pressures, temporary store closures, and other operational restrictions. There can be no assurance that our wholesale customers have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of such adverse economic conditions. To the extent one or more of our largest customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in our business strategy.\nOne of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and potentially, in the future, through acquisitions. We seek to grow by expanding our share with winning customers; stretching brands to new regions, channels, and categories; managing costs; leveraging our supply chain across Kontoor Brands; and expanding our direct-to-consumer business with emphasis on our e-commerce business. However, we may not be able to grow our existing businesses. For example:\n\u2022we may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer- and retail-centric;\n\u2022we may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of our products;\n\u2022we may not be able to expand our brands in Asia or other geographies, transform our business in certain regions or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives;\n\u2022we may not be able to successfully achieve the expected growth or cost savings of our Wrangler\u00ae and Lee\u00ae brand platforms;\n\u2022we may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees;\n\u2022we may not be able to achieve our direct-to-consumer expansion goals and manage our growth effectively;\n\u2022we may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements;\n\u2022we may have difficulty completing potential acquisitions or dispositions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration; and\n\u2022failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\nDuring 2021, we generated $26.6 million in net revenues from licensing royalties. Although we generally have significant control over our licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect our net revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a licensee\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022obtain capital;\n\u2022manage labor relations;\n\u2022maintain relationships with its suppliers;\n\u2022manage credit risk effectively;\n\u2022maintain relationships with its customers; and\n\u2022adhere to our global compliance principles.\nIn addition, we rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through contractual approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and\n13 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\npromotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee, including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards, could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.\nOur revenues and cash requirements are affected by seasonality.\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with a higher proportion of net revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which typically includes the back-to-school and holiday selling seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on our full-year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.\nThe loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nPRODUCT, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION-RELATED RISKS\nWe use third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of our raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to our business operations.\nDuring 2021, approximately 65% of our units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by Kontoor Brands-owned and -operated manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and Nicaragua. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver our products or our cost of producing or delivering products and, as a result, our profitability:\n\u2022political or labor instability in countries where our facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022changes in local economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in countries where our facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to us and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u2022disruption at domestic and foreign ports of entry could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;\n\u2022heightened terrorism or security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or lengthier inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u2022decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of our products, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;\n\u2022disruptions at suppliers and manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;\n\u2022disease epidemics and health-related concerns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted and could in the future result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of our goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the required labor and expertise;\n\u2022imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and\n\u2022imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nAlthough no single supplier is critical to our overall production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to us, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.\nIn addition, although we audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards, actions by a third-party supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n14 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\nWe rely on a limited number of North American mills for raw material sourcing, and we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity or quality.\nWe rely on a limited number of North American third-party suppliers for raw materials. Such products may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. In 2021, approximately 52% of our raw materials were provided by our top three suppliers in North America. We have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for raw materials, production and quota capacity. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of raw materials from current sources, or in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer due to consolidation, closure or otherwise, we may be unable to locate additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of raw materials or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to our customers. Our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of our products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting our distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities. Transportation of our products may be interrupted due to events such as marine disasters, bad weather or natural disasters, mechanical or electrical failures, public health crises, grounding, capsizing, fire, explosions and collisions, piracy, cyber-attacks, human error and war and terrorism resulting in delays, damages or losses. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter, or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer, can negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. In addition, severe weather events such as snowstorms or hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic. Physical risks from climate change may result in these weather events occurring more often and more acutely. Any of these conditions could result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customers.\nMost of the employees in our production and distribution facilities outside of the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and any material job actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOutside of the U.S., most of our production and distribution employees are covered by industry-sponsored and/or government-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. Any work stoppages or other job actions by these employees could harm our business and reputation.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nWe have recently implemented an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software system, and challenges with ongoing optimization and change management may impact our business and operations.\nWe have recently implemented a company-wide ERP software system and the related infrastructure to support future growth and to integrate our processes. The continued optimization and change management related to the ERP software system may prove to be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies related to our new ERP software system could materially impact our operations and adversely affect our ability to process orders, manage our inventory, ship products, provide customer support, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. Additionally, future cost estimates related to our new ERP software system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability.\n15 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nWe rely significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory, manage our supply chain and support our accounting and financial reporting processes. We are also dependent on information technology, including the internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorizations. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage, failure or interruption due to viruses, data security incidents, technical malfunctions, natural disasters or other causes, or in connection with upgrades to our systems or the implementation of new systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, improper design or configuration, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business, including management of inventory, ordering and replenishment of products, manufacturing and distribution of products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, tracking and recording of accounting transactions, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media.\nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our business operations, results of operations or reputation.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, store, use, process, disclose and transmit (\u201cProcess\u201d) certain sensitive, personal, regulated and/or confidential employee and customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information, including with respect to identity theft and user privacy. Cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, and if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our third-party service providers, they may be able to steal, access, publish, use, delete or modify confidential and sensitive information, including credit card information and personal information, that we have obligations to protect. Despite the security measures we currently have in place and our commitment to risk management practices, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate, detect or mitigate, data security breaches and other cyber incidents. In addition, employees or third-party service providers may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches, through failing to follow polices or otherwise, that result in the unauthorized access to or release or use of personal, sensitive or confidential information. We take, and require our third-party service providers that Process personal, confidential or sensitive information on our behalf to take, measures designed to protect such information and comply with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards related to information security and privacy. However, we cannot control the efforts of third-party service providers and cannot guarantee the compliance of their systems and processes. We and our customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee, customer and proprietary information were corrupted, lost, accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in our systems or one of our third-party service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers, result in unwanted media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with current and future state, federal and international laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal and other sensitive information such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, and state laws in the U.S. related to information security and privacy such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and China's Personal Information Protection Law. As the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy becomes increasingly more demanding with many new requirements surrounding the processing and protection of personal, confidential and sensitive information, the increased complexity in these types of laws and inherent conflicts between jurisdictions may result in our inability or failure to comply with applicable requirements, despite our focus and efforts. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risks, including significant fines for non-compliance, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nLEGAL, COMPLIANCE, AND SUSTAINABILITY RISKS\nClimate change, and related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, may adversely impact our business.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity and poor water quality. Physical risks related to these events could adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, increase our production costs, impose capacity restraints and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending. As a result, the physical effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn many countries, governmental bodies are enacting new or additional legislation and regulations to reduce or mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. If we, our suppliers or our contract manufacturers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience transition risks such as increases in energy, production, transportation and raw material costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and\n16 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\ndeductibles, which could adversely impact our operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.\nOur operations and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. These include proximity to countries in turmoil, shifts in local societal/cultural climates, change in local perceptions of foreign operators and uncertainty ahead of elections or regime changes, the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and the economic uncertainty associated with political developments. In addition, shocks to the economy of a country where we operate and/or critical residual shocks to the apparel/garment sector industry as a whole can have an outsize impact. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies or conditions and other factors may adversely affect our business or may require us to modify our current business practices. While enactment of any such change is not certain, if such changes were adopted, our costs could increase, which would reduce our earnings.\nChanges to trade policy, including tariff and import/export regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in policies governing foreign trade and manufacturing in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nTariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. We do a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws and audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, or allegations of such violation, could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a global business, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions in which we operate are discussing potential changes to their respective taxation regimes or adopting additional regulations. Specifically, countries in the European Union and around the globe have adopted and/or proposed changes to current tax laws. Organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have published action plans that, if adopted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we conduct business. Due to the large scale of our global business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nAs a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n17 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nOur business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, employment, data protection, privacy, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by us or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for us could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as well as on our reputation.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental, consumer protection, employment, data protection, privacy, safety and other matters. We could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by us from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.\nFailure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to us, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws, implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for our merchandise. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.\nIn accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to conduct an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and include a report on these internal controls in our annual reports, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls annually. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources. If management or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if our controls are not effective, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position and results of operations could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or suspension or delisting of our common stock from the NYSE, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect, enforce or defend our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nOur trademarks, trade names, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others copying our products and infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, especially with the shift in product mix to higher-priced brands and innovative new products in recent years.\nActions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of our products by others, or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights.\nSome of our brands, such as Wrangler\u00ae and Lee\u00ae, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition. The higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties. The counterfeiting of our products or the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights by third parties could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our net revenues.\nThe value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks.\nThere have been, and there may in the future be, opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of our intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending\n18 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\nany such claim, regardless of merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nFluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials, including commodity costs and finished goods, could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics such as denim, including cottons, blends, synthetics and wools, or other raw materials used by us in our manufactured products, or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold or our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. The prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns, freight rates and speculation in the commodities markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Inflation can also have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as cotton, dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries, and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. In the future, we may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or pass higher costs on to our customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.\nApproximately 25% of our total net revenues in 2021 are derived from markets outside the U.S. Our international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which our international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for our U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or our manufacturing facilities located in foreign countries. As a result, the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of our licensing net revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk.\nFurther, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose us to counterparty risks. Although we only enter into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in our statement of operations.\nOur policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference.\nIt is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit or brand change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of net revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. Although a charge would be non-cash, a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n19 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nOur ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.\nAny disruption in the capital markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions or investors to extend capital in the future. This could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings by the major independent rating agencies could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nWe have debt obligations, including our senior notes, that could restrict our business and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOn November 18, 2021, we entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) pursuant to which we issued and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at a rate of 4.125% per annum (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and concurrently entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for (i) a five-year $400.0 million term loan A facility (the \u201cAmended Term Loan A\u201d) and (ii) a five-year $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cAmended Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cAmended Credit Facilities\u201d), with the lenders and agents party thereto. The Indenture and the Amended Credit Agreement contain a number of restrictive covenants customary for these types of financings that impose restrictions on us and may limit our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities that may arise, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens on assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIf the Company fails to comply with any covenants or restrictions under the Indenture or the Amended Credit Agreement, it could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness, which may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, this could restrict our future business strategies and could adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\n20 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2021 Form 10-K\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly, and may continue to fluctuate significantly, due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Failures of our operating results to meet the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our shareholders, or changes by securities analysts in their estimates of our future earnings;\n\u2022Significant changes announced by our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022Changes in market valuations or earnings of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022General economic, industry and stock market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Future significant sales of our common stock by our shareholders or the perception in the market of such sales;\n\u2022Future issuances of our common stock by us; and\n\u2022The other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock may also be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of North Carolina law could delay or prevent a change in control of Kontoor Brands.\nThe existence of certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and North Carolina law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Kontoor Brands that a shareholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022Providing for a classified Board of Directors until our annual meeting of shareholders held in 2023;\n\u2022Providing that our directors may be removed by our shareholders only for cause while our Board is classified;\n\u2022Providing that the removal of our directors with or without cause after our Board is de-classified must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of Kontoor Brands;\n\u2022Providing the right to our Board of Directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022Authorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us;\n\u2022Prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders or taking action by written consent;\n\u2022Establishing advance notice and other requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at our annual shareholder meetings; and\n\u2022Requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of Kontoor Brands to approve certain business combinations.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition\n21 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K\nproposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our and our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation designate North Carolina as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and limit the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the North Carolina Business Court (or another state or federal court located in North Carolina, if a dispute does not qualify for designation to the North Carolina Business Court or the North Carolina Business Court otherwise lacks jurisdiction) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers or other employees to us or our shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of North Carolina law or our amended and restated articles of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours relating to the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation further provide that if an action described in the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than as specified above in the name of any shareholder, such shareholder is deemed to have consented to (i) personal jurisdiction before any state or federal court located in North Carolina, as appropriate, in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce our amended and restated articles of incorporation and (ii) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such action by service upon such shareholder\u2019s counsel in the action as agent for such shareholder. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is and will be subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness and any preferred stock, and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and, as such, will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities. Additionally, holders of our common stock may become subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that our Board of Directors may designate and issue without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors and preferred shareholders.\nWe cannot assure shareholders that our Board of Directors will declare dividends or that we will repurchase shares in the foreseeable future.\nWhile we currently return capital to shareholders through quarterly cash dividends, our Board of Directors may not declare dividends in the future or may decrease the amount of a dividend as compared to a prior period. In addition, our Board of Directors has implemented a share repurchase program. However, the declaration and amount of any future dividends and the limits of our share repurchase program will be determined and subject to authorization by our Board of Directors and the execution of share repurchases will be determined by management, and will be dependent upon multiple factors including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by our growth strategy and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and any other factors or considerations that our Board of Directors and management, as applicable, deems relevant. We may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as dividends or to repurchase shares, including as a result of the risks described herein. Any failure to pay dividends or repurchase shares, or pay dividends or conduct share repurchases at expected levels, may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact the price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 18578, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "KTB"}
