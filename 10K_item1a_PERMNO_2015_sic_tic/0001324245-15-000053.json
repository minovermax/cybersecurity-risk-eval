{"cik": "1324245", "company": "SOLERA HOLDINGS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements included above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we also provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors that we may not be aware of, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could cause assumptions that underlie our business plans, expectations and statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to be inaccurate.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in volume from, any of these customers would harm our financial results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to large insurance companies and collision repair facilities that have relationships with these insurance companies. During fiscal year 2015, we derived 15.3% of our revenues from our ten largest insurance company customers. The largest three of these customers accounted for 3.0%, 2.3%, and 1.9%, respectively, of our revenues during fiscal year 2015. A loss of one or more of these customers would result in a significant decrease in our revenues, including the business generated by collision repair facilities associated with those customers. Furthermore, many of our arrangements with European customers are terminable by them on short notice or at any time. In addition, disputes with customers may lead to delays in payments to us, terminations of agreements or litigation. Additional terminations or non-renewals of customer contracts or reductions in business from our large customers would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our failure to compete effectively could result in a loss of customers and market share, which could harm our revenues and operating results.\nThe markets for our automobile insurance claims processing software and services are highly competitive. In the United\nStates, our principal competitors are CCC Information Services Group Inc. and Mitchell International Inc. In Europe, our principal competitors are EurotaxGlass\u2019s Group, DAT GmbH and GT Motive Enisa Group. Mitchell International recently consummated a strategic relationship with GT Motive Einsa Group, including an equity investment. We also encounter regional or country-specific competition in the markets for automobile insurance claims processing software and services and our other products and services. For example Experian\u00ae is our principal competitor in the United Kingdom in the vehicle validation market, car.tv is our principal competitor in Germany in the online salvage vehicle disposition market and ChoicePoint is our principal competitor in the United States in the automobile reunderwriting solutions market. The principal competitors of SRS in the U.S. service, repair and maintenance software and solutions market are ALLDATA and the Mitchell 1 repair manuals. The principal competitor of our I&S business is Safelite Solutions and the principle competitors to CAP are Kee Resources and Glass's Guide. If one or more of our competitors develop software or services that are superior to ours or are more effective in marketing their software or services, our market share could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues. In addition, if one or more of our competitors retain existing or attract new customers for which we have developed new software or services, we may not realize expected revenues from these new offerings, thereby reducing our profitability.\nSome of our current or future competitors may have or develop closer customer relationships, develop stronger brands, have greater access to capital, lower cost structures and/or more attractive system design and operational capabilities than we have. Consolidation within our industry could result in the formation of competitors with substantially greater financial, management or marketing resources than we have, and such competitors could utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale in a manner that affects our ability to compete in the relevant market or markets. As a result of consolidation, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to promoting or selling their products and services, initiate and withstand substantial price competition, expand into new markets, hire away our key employees, change or limit access to key information and systems, take advantage of acquisition or other strategic opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings (including those products and services that may compete with our risk and asset management platform and our \u201cdigital garage\u201d product) more quickly than we can. In addition, our competitors may form strategic or exclusive relationships with each other, such as the equity interest in GT Motive purchased by Mitchell International, and with other companies in attempts to compete more successfully against us. These relationships may increase our competitors\u2019 ability, relative to ours, to address customer needs with their software and service offerings, which may enable them to rapidly increase their market share.\nMoreover, many insurance companies have historically entered into agreements with automobile insurance claims processing service providers like us and our competitors whereby the insurance company agrees to use that provider on an exclusive or preferred basis for particular products and services and agrees to require collision repair facilities, independent\nassessors and other vendors to use that provider. If our competitors are more successful than we are at negotiating these exclusive or preferential arrangements, we may lose market share even in markets where we retain other competitive advantages.\nIn addition, our insurance company customers have varying degrees of in-house development capabilities, and one or more of them have expanded and may seek to further expand their capabilities in the areas in which we operate. Many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and could commit significant resources to product development. Our software and services have been, and may in the future be, replicated by our insurance company customers in-house, which could result in our loss of those customers and their associated repair facilities, independent assessors and other vendors, resulting in decreased revenues and net income.\nThe time and expense associated with switching from our competitors\u2019 software and services to ours may limit our growth.\nThe costs for an insurance company to switch providers of claims processing software and services can be significant and the process can sometimes take 12 to 18 months to complete. As a result, potential customers may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our software and services, even if we offer competitive and economic advantages. If we are unable to convince these customers to switch to our software and services, our ability to increase market share will be limited and could harm our revenues and operating results.\nOur operating results may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to foreign currency exchange risks.\nWe derive most of our revenues, and incur most of our costs, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, mainly the Euro. In our historical financial statements, we translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our consolidated statement of income and certain components of stockholders\u2019 equity or the exchange rate at the end of that period for the consolidated balance sheet. These translations resulted in a net foreign currency translation adjustment of $(167.7) million and $39.1 million for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Ongoing global economic conditions have impacted currency exchange rates.\nExchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate. The majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in Euros, Pound Sterling, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and other foreign currencies. The following table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the Euro and Pound Sterling since the beginning of fiscal year 2014:\nDuring fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most major foreign currencies we use to transact our business. Relative to the Euro and the Pound Sterling, the average U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro by 11.4% and the Pound Sterling by 3.2%, which decreased our revenues and expenses during fiscal year 2015. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in an increase or decrease, as the case may be, to our revenues of $31.7 million during fiscal year 2015.\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to variability in foreign currency exchange rates. We use derivatives to mitigate risks associated with this variability. The following is a summary of outstanding derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2015 that are intended to mitigate our exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates:\n\u2022\nIn April 2012, we entered into two pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swaps in the aggregate notional amount of \u20ac109.0 million. We pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 6.990% and receive U.S. dollar fixed\ncoupon payments at 6.750% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the swaps is June 15, 2018. These cross-currency swaps were designated, at inception, as cash flow hedges. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings\n\u2022\nIn November 2014, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of \u20ac401.6 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.993% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\n\u2022\nIn March 2015, we entered into a pay fixed Euros / receive fixed U.S. dollars cross-currency swap with a notional amount of \u20ac174.8 million. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap, we pay Euro fixed coupon payments at 4.725% and receive U.S. dollar fixed coupon payments at 6.000% on the notional amount. The maturity date of the cross-currency swap is June 15, 2021. The cross-currency swap was designated as a net investment hedge at inception. We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity and reclassify these gains or losses into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. To date, there has been no hedge ineffectiveness.\n\u2022\nIn March 2015, we entered into a 60-day foreign exchange forward contract with a notional amount of \u20ac472.9 million. Under the terms of the forward contract, we pay predetermined forward rate on the settlement date. The foreign exchange forward contract was not designated as a hedge at inception. We recognize changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. In May 2015, we extended the settlement date of the foreign exchange forward contract to July 2015.\nFurther fluctuations in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could decrease our revenues and associated profits and, therefore, harm our future operating results.\nCurrent uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand, utilization and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from expectations.\nOur operations and performance depend on worldwide economic conditions, which have deteriorated significantly in many countries where our products and services are sold, and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. These conditions make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause our customers and potential customers to slow, reduce or refrain from spending on our products. In addition, external factors that affect our business have been and may continue to be impacted by the global economic slowdown. Examples include:\n\u2022\nNumber of Insurance Claims Made: In fiscal year 2015, the number of insurance claims made increased slightly versus fiscal year 2014. However, in several of our large western European markets, the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers declined slightly. The number of insurance claims made can be influenced by factors such as unemployment levels, the number of miles driven, changing gasoline prices, the number of uninsured drivers, changing insurance premiums and insured drivers opting for lower coverage or higher deductible levels, among other things. Fewer claims made can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate.\n\u2022\nSales of New and Used Vehicles: According to industry sources, global new light vehicle sales grew by 3.6% in 2014 to 86.3 million units and sales are forecasted to reach 88.3 million units, up by 2.4%, in 2015. In Advanced Markets, sales are projected to grow at a 0.7% compound annual growth rate from 2014 through 2024. In other markets, sales are projected to grow at a 6.6% compound annual growth rate from 2014 through 2024. Fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate\n\u2022\nUsed Vehicle Retail and Wholesale Values: Declines in retail and wholesale used vehicle values can impact vehicle owner and insurance carrier decisions about which damaged vehicles should be repaired and which should be declared a total loss. The lower the retail and wholesale used vehicle values, the more likely it is that a greater percentage of automobiles are declared a total loss versus a partial loss. The fewer number of vehicles that owners and insurance carriers decide to repair can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate for partial-loss estimates, but may have a beneficial impact on the transaction-based fees that we generate for total-loss estimates.\n\u2022\nAutomobile Usage-Number of Miles Driven: Several factors can influence miles driven, including gasoline prices and economic conditions. According to industry sources, for calendar year 2014, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased by 2.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2013, cumulative miles driven in the United States remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year. For calendar year 2012, cumulative miles driven in the United States increased compared to the same period in the prior year. Fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents, which can reduce the transaction-based fees that we generate. Many of our markets around the world continue to experience or have recently experienced volatility. Accordingly, we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in particular economic markets. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for or utilization of our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, joint ventures, dispositions or similar transactions that could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur substantial expenses, result in dilution to our stockholders and harm our business or results of operations.\nOur growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis. We have addressed and will continue to address the need to introduce new products both through internal development and through acquisitions of other companies and technologies that would complement or extend our business or enhance our technological capability. In fiscal year 2014, we acquired six businesses, as well as 50% ownership interest in SRS. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired six businesses, including I&S and CAP, and substantially all of the assets of another business. Subsequent to June 30, 2015, we acquired a business as well as the remaining 50% ownership interest in SRS.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a varying extent, on our ability to continue to expand the acquired business' products and services and integrate them with our products and services. Our management will be required to devote significant attention and resources to these efforts, which may disrupt our core business, the acquired business or both and, if executed ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the operations of the acquired business. In addition, the efforts required to realize the benefits of our acquisitions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The risks associated with our acquisitions and future acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing customer or supplier relationships, such as cancellation of orders or the loss of key customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating or retaining key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company, such as information technology resources, and financial and operational data;\n\u2022\nentering geographic or product markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating product lines or integrating technologies of the acquired company into our products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\npotential incompatibility of business cultures;\n\u2022\npotential dilution to existing stockholders if we issue shares of common stock or other securities as consideration in an acquisition or if we issue any such securities to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nprohibitions against completing acquisitions as a result of regulatory restrictions or disruptions in connection with regulatory investigations of completed acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the use of net operating losses or tax benefits;\n\u2022\nnegative market perception, which could negatively affect our stock price;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of debt and other liabilities, both known and unknown; and\n\u2022\nadditional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets or impairment charges related to purchased intangibles and goodwill, or write-offs, if any, recorded as a result of the acquisition.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy.\nOur merger and acquisition activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions. If we were found to violate antitrust and competition laws, we would be subject to various remedies, including divestiture of the acquired businesses. For example, we recently announced that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") closed its investigation into our acquisition of Actual Systems. Pursuant to the termination of the investigation, and without admitting any violation of the law, we agreed to enter into a consent order with the FTC relating to the salvage yard management system business and effected a voluntary divestiture of the United States and Canadian businesses of Actual Systems in August 2013 to a purchaser group substantially composed of the former shareholders of Actual Systems.\nWe participate in joint ventures in some countries and may participate in future joint ventures. Our partners in these ventures may have interests and goals that are inconsistent with or different from ours, which could result in the joint venture taking actions that negatively impact our growth in the local market and consequently harm our business or financial condition. If we are unable to find suitable partners or if suitable partners are unwilling to enter into joint ventures with us, our growth into new geographic markets may slow, which would harm our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may finance future acquisitions, and/or additional joint ventures with cash from operations, additional indebtedness and/or the issuance of additional securities, any of which may impair the operation of our business or present additional risks, such as reduced liquidity, or increased interest expense. We may also seek to restructure our business in the future by disposing of certain of our assets, which may harm our future operating results, divert significant managerial attention from our operations and/or require us to accept non-cash consideration, the market value of which may fluctuate.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may vary widely from period to period due to the sales cycle, seasonal fluctuations and other factors.\nOur contracts with insurance companies generally require time-consuming authorization procedures by the customer, which can result in additional delays between when we incur development costs and when we begin generating revenues from those software or service offerings. In addition, we incur significant operating expenses while we are researching and designing new software and related services, and we typically do not receive corresponding payments in those same periods. As a result, the number of new software and service offerings that we are able to implement, successfully or otherwise, can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations, and we may experience a decrease in our net income as we incur the expenses necessary to develop and design new software and services. Accordingly, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations. In particular, we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year. This seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets, which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods. In addition, our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors, including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays. For example, the Easter holiday occurs during the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years, resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs.\nWe anticipate that our revenues will continue to be subject to seasonality and therefore our financial results will vary from period to period. However, actual results from operations may or may not follow these normal seasonal patterns in a given year leading to performance that is not in alignment with expectations.\nWe also may experience variations in our earnings due to other factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new software or services by our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new software or services;\n\u2022\nthe volume of usage of our offerings by existing customers;\n\u2022\nvariations of vehicle accident rates due to factors such as changes in fuel prices, number of miles driven or new vehicle purchases and their impact on vehicle usage;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions, or changes in competitive conditions, in our industry generally;\n\u2022\nprolonged system failures during which time customers cannot submit or process transactions; or\n\u2022\nprolonged interruptions in our access to third-party data incorporated in our software and services.\nWe may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when contracts expire, are terminated or are not renewed. Any of these events could harm our financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and if we fail to keep pace with these changes or our present or future product offerings are diminished or made obsolete in the marketplace, our market share and revenues will decline.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of, and enhancements to, existing software and services, all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost. Industry changes could render our present or future product offerings (including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our \u201cdigital garage\u201d product) less attractive or obsolete, and we may be unable to make the necessary adjustments to our present or future product offerings at a competitive cost, or at all. We also incur substantial expenses in researching, developing, designing, purchasing, licensing and marketing new software and services, including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our \u201cdigital garage\u201d product. The development or adaptation of these new technologies and products may result in unanticipated expenditures and capital costs that would not be recovered in the event that such new technologies or products are unsuccessful. The research, development, production and marketing of new software and services are also subject to changing market requirements, access to and rights to use third-party data, the satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and customers\u2019 approval procedures and other factors, each of which could prevent us from successfully marketing any new software and services or responding to competing technologies. The success of new software in our industry also often depends on the ability to be first to market, and our failure to be first to market with any particular product offering could limit our ability to recover the development expenses associated with such product. If we cannot develop or acquire new technologies, software and services or any of our existing or anticipated future product offerings (including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our \u201cdigital garage\u201d product) are diminished in value, made less attractive or rendered obsolete by technological changes or present or future competitive products and services in the marketplace, our revenues and income could decline and we may lose market share to our established or new competitors, which would impact our future operations and financial results.\nWe are currently making, and anticipate making additional, strategic decisions and investments to leverage and expand our product and service offerings, including offerings in addition to the automotive sector.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant management attention and financial resources to develop, integrate and implement new business strategies, products, services, features, applications, and functionality (including but not limited to our risk and asset management platform and our \"digital garage\" product). Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current core operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unanticipated issues or problems that arise during our implementation of such strategies and offerings. Because these new endeavors are inherently risky, our business strategies and product and service offerings may not be successful and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our strategies and offerings may be outside the insurance claims industry such as our SMR business. CAP and our \"digital garage\" product), may be outside of the automotive sector (such as our property claims business and our \"digital\ngarage\" product), or may be consumer-based (such as our \"digital garage\" product). We have limited historical experience directly serving consumers or customers outside of the automotive sector and our products and services may not be accepted or widely utilized by such consumers or customers. These offerings may also subject us to new or additional laws and regulations (including those relating to consumer protection) and may lead to increased legal and regulatory compliance, risk and liability.\nChanges in or violations by us or our customers of applicable government regulations could reduce demand for or limit our ability to provide our software and services in those jurisdictions.\nOur insurance company customers are subject to extensive government regulations, mainly at the state level in the United States and at the country level in our non-U.S. markets. Some of these regulations relate directly to our software and services, including regulations governing the use of total loss and estimating software. If our insurance company customers fail to comply with new or existing insurance regulations, including those applicable to our software and services, they could lose their certifications to provide insurance and/or reduce their usage of our software and services, either of which would reduce our revenues. Also, we are subject to direct regulation in some markets, and our failure to comply with these regulations could significantly reduce our revenues or subject us to government sanctions. In addition, future regulations could force us to implement costly changes to our software and/or databases or have the effect of prohibiting or rendering less valuable one or more of our offerings. Moreover, some states in the United States have changed and are contemplating changes to their regulations to permit insurance companies to use book valuations or public source valuations for total loss calculations, making our total loss software potentially less valuable to insurance companies in those states. Some states have adopted total loss regulations that, among other things, require insurers to use a methodology deemed acceptable to the respective government agency.\nWe submit our methodology to such agencies, and if they do not approve our methodology, we will not be able to perform total loss valuations in their respective states. Other states are considering legislation that would limit the data that our software can provide to our insurance company customers. In the event that demand for or our ability to provide our software and services decreases in particular jurisdictions due to regulatory changes, our revenues and margins may decrease.\nThere is momentum to create a U.S. federal government oversight mechanism for the insurance industry. There is also legislation under consideration by the U.S. legislature relating to the vehicle repair industry. Federal regulatory oversight of or legislation relating to the insurance industry in the United States could result in a broader impact on our business versus similar oversight or legislation at the U.S. state level.\nRegulatory developments could negatively impact our business.\nWe acquire and distribute personal, public and non-public information, store it in our some of our databases and provide it in various forms to certain of our customers in accordance with applicable law and contracts. We are subject to government regulation and, from time to time, companies in similar lines of business to us are subject to adverse publicity concerning the use of such data. We provide many types of data and services that are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, the United Kingdom's Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Order 2001, and, to a lesser extent, various other international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information. Our suppliers that provide us with protected and regulated data face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our certain of our products and services. Additionally, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy of personal information. They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. The following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:\n\u2022\namendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access, use and distribution of personal information and limit the supply of data available to customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our services;\n\u2022\nfailure of our services to comply with current or amended laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our services to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an operational effective, efficient, cost-effective manner.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, which reduces the cash available to finance our organic growth, make strategic acquisitions and enter into alliances and joint ventures; our bond indentures contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain activities.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2015, our indebtedness, including current maturities, was $2.5 billion, which consists of $1.7 billion related to the senior unsecured notes due 2021, $574.4 million related to the senior unsecured notes due 2023, and a $200.0 million unsecured term loan due 2016.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, our aggregate interest expense was $124.7 million and cash paid for interest was $128.8 million. As a result of our issuance of senior unsecured notes in November 2014 and July 2014 and the unsecured term loan in June 2015, we expect our interest expense and cash interest expense to increase in fiscal year 2015 as compared to previous periods.\nOur indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions and reduce our revenues;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations for making payments on our indebtedness which would prevent us from using it for other purposes including product development;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we have variable rate debt that is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements, make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances and collaborations.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments, we may be required to refinance our debt, to dispose of assets or to repatriate foreign earnings to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that debt refinancings or asset dispositions could be completed on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments. If we were to repatriate foreign earnings, we would incur incremental U.S. federal and state income taxes.\nOur bond indentures contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge with, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of our or their assets to, another person, and, in the case of any of our subsidiaries that did not issue or guarantee our senior notes, incur indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. If acceleration occurs, we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance our debt. Even if new financing is made available to us, it may not be available on acceptable or reasonable terms. An acceleration of our indebtedness would impair our ability to operate as a going concern.\nPursuant to agreements entered into prior to the CSG Acquisition, the noncontrolling stockholders of certain of our majority-owned subsidiaries have the right to require us to redeem their shares at the then fair market value. For financial statement reporting purposes, the estimated fair market value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was $84.6 million at June 30, 2015.\nWe are active in over 75 countries, where we are subject to country-specific risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately 56% and 63% of our revenues, respectively, outside the U.S. and we expect revenues from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a majority of our total revenues. Business and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to\ntariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, currency exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our activities across over 75 different countries. Furthermore, our business strategy includes expansion of our operations into new and developing markets, which will require even greater international coordination, expose us to additional local government regulations and involve markets in which we do not have experience or established operations. In addition, our operations in each country are vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies, intellectual property protection disputes, the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems, the collection of receivables through foreign legal systems, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, unsettled political conditions, possible terrorist attacks and pandemic disease. These and other factors may harm our operations in those countries and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions. Our earnings will be harmed if we suffer an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform an annual, or in certain situations a more frequent, assessment for possible impairment for accounting purposes. At June 30, 2015, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of $2.8 billion, or approximately 76% of our total assets. If we do not achieve our planned operating results or other factors impair these assets, we may be required to incur a non-cash impairment charge. Any impairment charges in the future will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incur significant restructuring and severance charges in future periods, which would harm our operating results and cash position or increase debt.\nWe incurred restructuring charges of $6.3 million and $6.5 million during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. These charges consist primarily of relocation and termination benefits paid or to be paid to employees, lease obligations associated with vacated facilities and other costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives. As of June 30, 2015, our remaining restructuring and severance obligations associated with these restructuring initiatives were $1.0 million.\nWe regularly evaluate our existing operations and capacity, and we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of future personnel reductions, related restructuring, and productivity and technology enhancements, which could exceed the levels of our historical charges. In addition, we may incur certain unforeseen costs as existing or future restructuring activities are implemented. Any of these potential charges could harm our operating results and significantly reduce our cash position.\nOur software and services rely on information generated by third parties and any interruption of our access to such information could materially harm our operating results.\nWe believe that our success depends significantly on our ability to provide our customers access to data from many different sources. For example, a substantial portion of the data used in our repair estimating software is derived from parts and repair data provided by, among others, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, aftermarket parts suppliers, data aggregators, automobile dealerships, government organizations and vehicle repair facilities. We obtain much of our data about vehicle parts and components and collision repair labor and costs through license agreements with OEMs, automobile dealers, and other providers; and we obtain much of our data in our vehicle validation database and motor violation database from government organizations. EurotaxGlass\u2019s Group, one of our primary competitors in Europe, provides us with valuation and paint data for use in our European markets pursuant to a similar arrangement. In some cases, the data included in our products and services is licensed from sole-source suppliers. Mitchell International, one of our primary competitors in the United States, has historically provided us with vehicle glass data for use in our U.S. markets pursuant to a vehicle data license agreement. Many of the license agreements through which we obtain data are for terms of one year and may be terminated without cost to the provider on short notice.\nIf one or more of our licenses are terminated or if we are unable to renew one or more of these licenses on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to access the information (in the case of information licensed from sole-service suppliers) or unable to access alternative data sources that would provide comparable information without incurring substantial additional costs. Some data sources have indicated to us that they intend to materially increase the licensing costs for their data. While we do not believe that our access to many of the individual sources of data is material to our operations, prolonged industry-wide price increases or reductions in data availability could make receiving certain data more difficult and could result in significant cost increases, which would materially harm our operating results.\nSystem failures, delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business, cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide accurate, consistent and reliable services and information to our customers on a timely basis. Our operations could be interrupted by any damage to or failure of:\n\u2022\nour computer software or hardware or our customers\u2019 or third-party service providers\u2019 computer software or hardware;\n\u2022\nour networks, our customers\u2019 networks or our third-party service providers\u2019 networks; and\n\u2022\nour connections to and outsourced service arrangements with third parties, such as Acxiom, which hosts data and applications for us and our customers.\nOur systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\npower loss or other telecommunications failures;\n\u2022\nearthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses or software defects;\n\u2022\nphysical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u2022\nerrors by our employees or third-party service providers.\nAs part of our ongoing process improvements efforts, we have and will continue to migrate product and system platforms to next generation platforms and we may increase data and applications that we host ourselves, and the risks noted above will be exacerbated by these efforts. Because many of our services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), including those of our customers and vendors, could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner, which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or reduced business from current customers. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers to a limited extent for damages they sustain related to the unavailability of, or errors in, the software and services we provide; therefore, a significant interruption of, or errors in, our software and services could expose us to significant customer liability.\nFraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.\nSecurity breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers and data suppliers. Our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. If users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks.\nIn addition, customers\u2019 misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.\nA security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:\n\u2022\ndeterring customers from using our solutions;\n\u2022\ndeterring data suppliers from supplying data to us;\n\u2022\nharming our reputation;\n\u2022\nexposing us to liability;\n\u2022\nincreasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach;\n\u2022\naffecting our ability to meet customers\u2019 expectations; or\n\u2022\ncausing inquiry from governmental authorities.\nWe may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired. The number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. Any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nPrivacy concerns could require us to exclude data from our software and services, which may reduce the value of our offerings to our customers, damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our software and services.\nIn the United States, European Union and other jurisdictions, there are significant restrictions on the use of personal and consumer data. Our violations of these laws could harm our business. In addition, these restrictions may place limits on the information that we can collect from and provide to our customers. Furthermore, concerns about our collection, use or sharing of automobile insurance claims information, moving violation information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace. If we lose the services of these individuals, or are unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees to support our present and future operations and business strategy, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon the ability and experience of our key personnel, who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing automobile insurance claims processing industry and the markets in which we offer our software and services. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key employees, particularly our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Tony Aquila, could harm our business and operations.\nOur success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage and retain qualified management, sales and technical personnel as we grow and implement our present and future business strategy. Particularly, we have a present and anticipated future need to attract, manage and retain sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified personnel to develop and commercialize our risk and asset management platform and our \u201cdigital garage\u201d product offering. Competition for such qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to continue to attract or retain such qualified personnel in the future.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to develop and market new software and services and to generate revenues at levels sufficient to cover ongoing expenses or possible acquisition or similar transactions. If we need to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to our outstanding common stock. In the case of debt financings, we may have to grant additional security interests in our assets to lenders and agree to restrictive business and operating covenants. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business depends on our brands, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity we have developed and acquired has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands, such as Solera, Solera Holdings, Audatex, ABZ, Hollander, Informex, Sidexa, HPI, AUTOonline, Market Scan, IMS, Identifix, AutoPoint, LYNX Services, CAP and Explore, are critical to the expansion of our software and services to new customers in both existing and new markets. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed. We anticipate that, as our markets become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology innovator, to continue to provide high quality software and services and protect and defend our brand names and trademarks, which we may not do successfully. To date, we have not engaged in extensive direct brand promotion activities, and we may not successfully implement brand enhancement efforts in the future.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we could be prevented from selling our software or suffer significant litigation expense even if these claims have no merit.\nOur competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that our software, products or technology, including claims data or other data, which we obtain from other parties, are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. We may also develop software, products or technology, unaware of pending patent applications of others, which software products or technology may infringe a third party patent once that patent is issued. Any claims of intellectual property infringement or other violation, even claims without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. In addition, if any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing or violating its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our software or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. These claims may also require us to stop selling our software and/or services as currently designed, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our software or services and may result in a material loss in revenue. Currently, one of our trademarks is subject to a nullification proceeding in front of the Brazil trademark authority.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights, either without incurring significant costs or at all, which would harm our business.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, patents, license agreements and contractual provisions, as well as internal procedures, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken and will take to protect our intellectual property rights may not deter infringement, duplication, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property by third parties. In addition, any of the intellectual property we own or license from third parties may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable, or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful information. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign patent, trademark and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our software and other intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the U.S., if at all. We may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. We may also be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge, trade secrets or other proprietary information by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, intellectual property assignments and other contractual restrictions. It is also possible that others will independently develop the technology that is the same or similar to ours. If our trade secrets and other proprietary information become known or we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.\nWe rely on our brands to distinguish our products and services from the products and services of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register trademarks covering many of these brands. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands.\nThird parties, including competitors, may infringe our intellectual property right and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our intellectual property rights. Pursuing infringers of our intellectual property could result in significant monetary costs and diversion of management resources, and any failure to pursue or successfully litigate claims against infringers or otherwise enforce our intellectual property rights could result in competitors using our technology and offering similar products and services, potentially resulting in loss of our competitive advantage and decreased revenues.\nCurrently, we believe that one or more of our customers in our EMEA segment may be infringing our intellectual property by making and distributing unauthorized copies of our software. We have also filed a trademark revocation application with the European Union trademark authority seeking revocation of a registered trademark held by a company in the United Kingdom that is similar to one of the trademarks we use. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult and may require considerable resources.\nOur lawsuit against Mitchell International, Inc. for patent infringement will be costly to litigate, could be decided adversely to us, and could adversely affect our intellectual property rights, distract our management and technical staff, and cause our stock price to decline.\nOn February 6, 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Mitchell International, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of one of our U.S. patents and we subsequently added an additional two continuation patents to the lawsuit. On February 24, 2015, at Mitchell International\u2019s request, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) instituted a Covered Business Method Patent Review (\u201cCBM\u201d) of the patents at issue in the lawsuit. In so doing, the USPTO preliminarily determined that it is more likely than not that the claims of such patents are not eligible for patent protection. Oral argument of the CBM proceeding before the USPTO is currently scheduled for October 19, 2015. It is possible that the USPTO may ultimately invalidate or narrow the scope of such patents when it issues its final ruling. On March 24, 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, where the lawsuit now resides, issued an order to stay the lawsuit pending the ruling of the USPTO in the CBM proceeding.\nIf the lawsuit resumes following completion of the CBM, we expect that the lawsuit, if we cannot resolve it before trial, could require a substantial period of time to litigate, and at this stage we cannot predict the duration or cost of such litigation. We also expect that the lawsuit, even if it is ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us on favorable terms, will be costly to litigate, and that the cost of such litigation could have an adverse financial impact on our operating results. The CBM and the litigation could also distract our management team and technical personnel from our other business operations, to the detriment of our business results. It is possible that we might not prevail in the CBM or in our lawsuit against Mitchell International, in which case our costs of litigation would not be recovered, and we could effectively lose some of our patent rights. It is also possible that Mitchell International might respond to our lawsuit by asserting counterclaims against us. Delays in the litigation, and any or all of these potential adverse results, could cause a substantial decline in our stock price.\nCurrent or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we have been involved in disputes with collision repair facilities, acting individually and as a group in some situations that claim that we have colluded with our insurance company customers to depress the repair time estimates generated by our repair estimating software. We have also been involved in litigation alleging that we have colluded with our insurance company customers to cause the estimates of vehicle fair market value generated by our total loss estimation software to be unfairly low. On February 28, 2014, Solera, Explore, and Audatex North America, Inc. were each served with a civil complaint filed against them and another defendant by an insurance company third party claimant in Minnesota state court. The complaint seeks state-wide class action status for similarly situated claimants, claiming that the defendant\u2019s methodology for determining the value of total loss vehicles violates Minnesota law. We filed a motion to dismiss on April 18, 2014. The complaint was subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota and an amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014. We and our co-defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint and on October 31, 2014, the Court issued an order dismissing two of the three counts with prejudice and, of the remaining count, dismissing one claim with prejudice and one claim without prejudice. Furthermore, we are also subject to assertions by our customers and strategic partners that we have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them or that the agreements are not enforceable against them, some of which are the subject of pending litigation and any of which could in the future lead to arbitration or litigation. While we do not expect the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is unpredictable and excessive verdicts, both in the form of monetary damages and injunction, could occur. In the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to periodic changes in the amount of our income tax provision and these changes could adversely affect our operating results; we may not be able to utilize all of our tax benefits before they expire.\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our mix of earnings in countries with high versus low tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by a change in our assertion that our foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested; by the outcomes of examinations, audits or disputes by or with relevant tax authorities; or by changes in tax laws and regulations.\nFor purposes of concluding our domestic deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not realizable we currently rely on Subpart F income as a source of future taxable income. A change in U.S. tax law that would reduce Subpart F income, and accordingly future taxable income, would require us to assess the need for a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in ASC Topic No. 740-10, Income Taxes. In addition, ASC Topic No. 740-10 applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital.\nWe are subject to adverse changes in our liquidity if we initiate action to repatriate unremitted earnings and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes.\nOur foreign subsidiaries generate earnings that are not subject to U.S. income taxes so long as they are permanently reinvested in our operations outside of the U.S. Pursuant to ASC Topic No. 740-30 (formerly APB 23), undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested would become subject to deferred income taxes under U.S. tax law. In determining if the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, we consider the following: (i) the forecasts, budgets and cash requirements of our U.S business and our foreign subsidiaries, both for the short and long term; (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest foreign earnings, including any changes in U.S. income tax law relating to the treatment of these undistributed foreign earnings; and (iii) any U.S. and foreign government programs or regulations relating to the repatriation of these unremitted earnings. We have concluded that $350.0 million of our foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, and we have recognized a deferred income taxes on these earnings. If we initiate actions to repatriate these unremitted earnings and precipitate payments of U.S. income taxes, such payments could materially adversely affect our liquidity. We continue to assert that the $732.0 million of undistributed earnings is permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and have no current plans to repatriate those earnings.\nWe began paying dividends in fiscal year 2010 and we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock and restricted stock units in the future; as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment may be if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe began paying quarterly cash dividends to holders of our outstanding of common stock and restricted stock units in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. On August 25, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.225 per outstanding share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit. The dividends are payable on September 22, 2015 to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on September 8, 2015. Any determination to pay dividends in future periods will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and restricted stock units in future periods may be limited by restrictive covenants under the indenture for the senior unsecured notes. As a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us could be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. We cannot assure you that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay.\nRequirements associated with being a public company increase our costs significantly, as well as divert significant company resources and management attention.\nThe expenses that are required as a result of being a public company are and will likely continue to be material. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies also require considerable time and attention of management. In addition, any changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis.\nWe continue to work with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. In addition, we are taking steps to address new U.S. federal legislation relating to corporate governance matters and are monitoring other proposed and recently-enacted U.S. federal and state legislation relating to corporate governance and other regulatory matters and how the legislation could affect our obligations as a public company.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders may receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without the need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nany vacancy on the board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office;\n\u2022\ninability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders and limited ability of stockholders to take action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for board nominations and proposing matters to be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe are monitoring proposed U.S. federal and state legislation relating to stockholder rights and related regulatory matters and how the legislation could affect, among other things, the nomination and election of directors and our charter documents.\nOur evaluation of strategic alternatives may not result in a transaction and we do not intend to provide ongoing updates to this process.\nOn August 20, 2015, we confirmed that we are exploring a variety of strategic alternatives, which could include a possible sale of the company. This process is still in its preliminary stages and there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction. At this time, we are unable to provide any details regarding the possible parties to, the timing or the terms and conditions of any such transaction and investors should not place undue reliance on this announcement. As a matter of course, we typically do not comment on our ongoing strategic activities and we do not expect to make further public comment regarding these matters while our exploration process continues.", "PERMNO": 92021, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SLH"}
