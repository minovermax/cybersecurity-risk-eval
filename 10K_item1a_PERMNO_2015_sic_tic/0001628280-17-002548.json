Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating the Company and its business. The risks described below are the risks that the Company currently believes are material to its business. However, additional risks not presently known to the Company, or risks that it currently believes are not material, may also impair its business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including the information set forth in \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d as well as the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The Company's business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If the Company is adversely affected by such risks, then the market price of its common stock could decline.\nChanges in laws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict the Company's ability to sell its products in some markets or require the Company to make changes to its business model in some markets.\nDirect selling marketing systems are subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies throughout the world. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to ensure that sales are made to consumers of the products, and that compensation, recognition and advancement within the selling organization are based upon sales of the products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Violations could result from misconduct by an independent distributor, ambiguity in statutes, changes or new laws and regulations affecting the Company's business and court-related decisions. Furthermore, the Company may be restricted or prohibited from using direct selling activities in some foreign countries, or the Company may be required to undertake lengthy and costly application processes to obtain a direct selling license to engage in direct selling activities. In addition, changes in existing laws or additional regulations could make it difficult to register or sell the Company's products in the countries in which it operates.\nIn the United States, multilevel marketing companies may be the subject of investigations and enforcement actions by the FTC. For example, in 2015, the FTC initiated an enforcement action against a direct selling company, alleging an illegal business model and improper earnings claims, which the FTC and the direct selling company settled in September 2016, by entering into a stipulated order. In July 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement agreement with another direct selling company, which required the particular direct selling company to restructure its U.S. business operations to settle charges relating to deceptive advertising, misrepresentation and an illegal business model. The settlement of each of these cases required the direct selling company involved to, among other things, pay a significant fine, revise its compensation plan to comply with restrictions on how it can compensate its independent distributors and change its marketing practices to avoid misleading income, earning and other representations. Being the target of an investigation or enforcement action by the FTC, or being required to make significant revisions to its compensation plan, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business activities in China require the Company to comply with complex legal and regulatory requirements, which require the Company to obtain various approvals and licenses and to utilize a different business model from that which it uses elsewhere in the world.\nThe Chinese government exercises significant control over all aspects of the Chinese economy, and the direct selling industry in particular. In 2005, China published regulations governing direct selling and prohibiting pyramid promotional schemes, and a number of administrative methods and proclamations were issued in 2005 and in 2006. These regulations require the Company to use a business model different from that which it offers in other markets.\nThe direct selling regulations require the Company to apply for various approvals and licenses to conduct a direct selling enterprise in China. The process for obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct a direct selling business is protracted and cumbersome and involves multiple layers of Chinese governmental authorities and numerous governmental employees at each layer. While direct selling licenses are centrally issued, such licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained. Such approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases, and the approval process requires involvement with multiple ministries at each level. The Company's participation and conduct during the approval process is guided not only by distinct Chinese practices and customs, but is also subject to applicable laws of China and the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the U.S., as well as the Company's internal code of ethics. There is always a risk that in attempting to comply with local customs and practices in China during the application process or otherwise, the Company will fail to comply with requirements applicable in China itself or in other jurisdictions, and any such failure to comply with applicable requirements could prevent the Company from obtaining the direct selling licenses or related local or provincial approvals. Furthermore, the Company relies on certain key management, regulatory and legal personnel in China to assist during the approval process, and the loss of any such key personnel could delay or hinder the Company's ability to obtain licenses or related approvals. For all of the above reasons, the Company may be unable to obtain, or experience prolonged delays in obtaining, direct-selling licenses or related approvals necessary to expand into any or all of the localities or provinces in China that are important to the Company's business in China. The Company's inability to obtain, retain, or renew, or a prolonged delay in obtaining or renewing, any or all of the licenses or related approvals that are required to operate in China would have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, although certain regulations have been published with respect to obtaining and operating under such approvals and otherwise conducting business in China, other regulations are pending and there continues to be uncertainty regarding the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese regulations. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. As a result, the model the Company created specifically for China may not continue to be deemed compliant by national or local Chinese regulatory authorities. The Chinese government rigorously monitors the direct selling market in China, and in the past has taken serious action against companies that the government believed were engaging in activities they regarded to be in violation of applicable law, including shutting down their businesses and imposing substantial fines. As a result, there can be no guarantee that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of the existing and new regulations will not negatively impact the Company's business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nChinese regulations prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. The Company cannot guarantee that any of its independent distributors living outside of China or any of its independent distributors or independent service providers in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate the Company's policies in this market, or that violate Chinese law or other applicable law, and therefore result in regulatory action and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulations and could be subject to additional laws and regulations.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sales of each of the Company\u2019s major product groups are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign governmental agencies and authorities. In the U.S., these governmental agencies and authorities include the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, the USDA and state regulatory agencies. In September 2015, the New York Attorney General issued a cease and desist letter to the Company and many other national manufacturers and retailers, related to the sale of a common herbal supplement known as Devil\u2019s Claw. In the letter, the New York Attorney General requested, among other things, that the Company provide certain information with respect to the Company\u2019s manufacture and sale of Devil\u2019s Claw products. Although the Company believes it is lawfully selling Devil\u2019s Claw products, the letters that it and other retailers received, demonstrate a focus by the New York Attorney General and other states\u2019 Attorneys General on the manufacture and sale of various dietary supplements. As a result of such focus, such states\u2019\nAttorneys General could seek to take actions against the Company or other industry participants or amend applicable regulations in their State, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition by causing the Company to incur additional costs to comply or cease selling one or more of its products.\nGenerally, each international market in which the Company operates has regulatory agencies similar to the regulatory agencies in the U.S. These markets have varied regulations which often require it to reformulate products for specific markets, conform product labeling to market regulations and register or qualify products or obtain necessary approvals with the applicable governmental authorities in order to market its products in these markets. Failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of these various governmental agencies and authorities could result in enforcement actions including: cease and desist orders, injunctions, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestitures of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these regulations could result in substantial financial or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the future, the Company may be subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, the repeal or amendment of laws or regulations which it considers favorable and/or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. The Company can neither predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on its business. They could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, imposition of additional record-keeping requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and expanded or altered labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all such requirements could increase the Company's costs of operating the business and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of the Company\u2019s products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. The FTC has also recently initiated investigations and enforcement actions against direct selling companies the FTC alleged made misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent distributor within a company's compensation plan. Recently, private watchdog groups have increased their attention on companies in the dietary supplement and direct selling industries with allegations of false or misleading product and earing claims. The goal of such private watchdog groups is to get the FTC to take enforcement action against practices they believe are illegal. The Company cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question its advertising claims, or advertising claims made by the Company's independent distributors, in the future. An enforcement action brought by the FTC, or other comparable foreign agency, would harm the Company's reputation and potentially result in significant penalties, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business in a particular market or in general. Assertions that the Company failed to comply with regulations or the effect of adverse regulations in one market could materially adversely affect it in other markets as well, by causing increased regulatory scrutiny in those other markets or as a result of the negative publicity generated in those other markets.\nChallenges to the form of the Company's direct selling program could harm our business.\nThe Company may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding direct selling marketing systems. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \"bright line\" rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by government agencies or courts can change. From time to time, the Company becomes aware of investigations and legal actions against other companies in the direct selling industry. An adverse ruling in these investigations or legal actions could impact the Company's business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example, in 2015, the FTC initiated an enforcement action against a direct selling company, alleging an illegal business model and improper earnings claims, which the FTC and the direct selling company settled in September 2016, by entering into a stipulated order. In July 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement agreement with another direct selling company, which required the particular direct selling company to restructure its U.S. business operations and compensation plan to settle charges relating to deceptive advertising, misrepresentation and an illegal business model.\nThe Company could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. From time to time, the Company becomes aware of civil actions against some of its competitors in the United States, which have and may in the future result in\nsignificant settlements. Allegations by short sellers directed at the Company and its competitors regarding the legality of direct selling in various markets have also created intense public scrutiny of the direct selling industry.\nThe Company is subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a violation of which could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business as well requiring companies and their intermediaries to maintain accurate books and records. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by the Department of Justice and the SEC relating to business operations within certain countries in which the Company operates, including China. For example, in January 2017, a direct selling company announced that it was the target of an investigation being conducted by the SEC to determine whether certain activities related to the direct selling company's operations in China violated the FCPA. In February 2017, another direct selling company announced that it had initiated a voluntary probe of its operations in China to determine if violations of the FCPA had occurred.\nThe Company\u2019s policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. However, the Company may be liable for actions of its employees and agents, even if such actions are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s policies. Being subject to an investigation by the Department of Justice or the SEC for an alleged violation of the FCPA could cause the Company to incur significant expenses and distractions that could harm its business. Violations of the FCPA, or a similar anti-bribery law, may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company's expansion in China is subject to risks associated with operating a joint venture.\nOn August 25, 2014, the Company completed a transaction with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d), which created a joint venture owned 80 percent by the Company and 20 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun Pharma. Effective operation of the joint venture depends on good relations between the Company and Fosun Pharma, active synergies between the two companies and positive legal and regulatory recognition of the joint venture. Any disruption in relations, inability to work efficiently or disadvantageous treatment of the joint venture by the Chinese or other authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, its business could be harmed.\nThe Company's registration of its products for sale in China is extremely time intensive. The requirements for obtaining product registrations and/or licenses involve extended periods of time that may delay the Company from offering products for sale or prevent it from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in China as \u201chealth foods\u201d or for which certain claims are used are subject to \u201cblue cap\u201d or \u201cblue hat\u201d registrations, which involve extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by governmental authorities. This registration process can take anywhere from 18 months to 3 years, but may be substantially longer. The Company currently intends to market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in China. There is risk associated with the common practice in China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of products is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit the Company's ability to market such products in China and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain independent distributors, its business could suffer.\nAs a direct selling company, the Company relies on its independent distributors to market and sell its products. Many independent distributors sell the Company's products on a part-time basis to friends or associates or use the products for themselves. The Company's independent distributors may terminate their service at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, the Company experiences high turnover among its independent distributors from year to year. As a result, the Company needs to retain existing independent distributors and continue to attract additional independent distributors to maintain and/or increase sales in the future. A significant amount of the Company's revenue in some of its markets is dependent on only a few independent distributors and their extensive sales networks. The loss of one of these independent distributors who, together with their extensive sales network, generate a significant amount of the Company's revenue could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nMany factors affect the Company's ability to attract and retain independent distributors, including:\n\u2022\nany adverse publicity regarding the Company, its products, its distribution channels or its competitors;\n\u2022\non-going motivation of Company's independent distributors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions about the value and efficacy of the Company's products;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions and acceptance of direct selling;\n\u2022\ngeneral and economic business conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges to the Company's compensation arrangements, training and support for its independent distributors; and\n\u2022\ncompetition in attracting and retaining independent distributors and/or market saturation.\nThe Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the Company's independent distributors are unable to maintain their current levels of productivity or if the Company is unable to retain existing independent distributors and attract additional independent distributors in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain present sales levels.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect the Company's net revenue and earnings.\nIn 2016, the Company recognized approximately 56.6 percent of its revenue in markets outside the United States, the majority of which was recognized in each market\u2019s respective local currency. The Company purchases inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing its financial statements, the Company translates revenues and expenses in foreign countries from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Because a majority of its sales are in foreign countries, exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on its sales and earnings. The Company reported earnings have in the past been, and are likely to continue to be, significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with net sales and earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar. These fluctuations had a generally negative effect on the Company's revenue in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. As the Company's operations grow in countries where foreign currency transactions are made, its operating results will increasingly be subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations, and it may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of these changes on the Company's future results of operations or financial condition.\nDifficult economic conditions could harm the Company's business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging and complex. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the Company's products, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel prices, salaries and wages, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. Economic slowdowns in the markets in which the Company does business may adversely affect consumer spending habits and demand for the Company's products, which may result in lower net sales of the Company's products in future periods. A prolonged global or regional economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For example, recent economic declines in Mainland China's stock market and other negative economic indicators have caused uncertainty regarding the potential for growth in Mainland China's economy. Continued declines in economic conditions in Mainland China could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nGeopolitical issues, conflicts and other global events could adversely affect the Company's business.\nBecause a substantial portion of the Company's business is conducted outside of the United States, its business is subject to global political issues and conflicts. Such political issues and conflicts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition if they escalate in areas in which the Company does business. In addition, changes in and adverse actions by governments in foreign markets in which the Company does business could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company's financial condition and results of operations of its NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe segment have been materially adversely\naffected by the political unrest in Ukraine and Russia, the continued sanctions in Russia, significant changes in global oil prices and the impact of currency devaluation.\nSome of the markets in which the Company operates have currency controls in place which may restrict the repatriation of cash.\nGovernments may restrict transfers of cash out of their country or take steps to control exchange rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition if the Company is unable to repatriate cash at exchange rates beneficial to the Company. For example, in 2014, the Company discontinued its operations in Venezuela due to the difficulties and uncertainties related to import controls, difficulties associated with repatriating cash and high inflation.\nTaxation and transfer pricing affect the Company's operations.\nThe Company is subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between the U.S. parent Company and its foreign subsidiaries. These pricing laws are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income and expense are reported by its U.S. and foreign entities, and that they are taxed appropriately. Regulators in the United States and in foreign markets closely monitor the Company's corporate structures, intercompany transactions, and how it effectuates intercompany fund transfers. The Company's effective tax rate could increase and its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affect if regulators challenge the Company's corporate structures, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers. The Company is eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for certain foreign taxes actually paid abroad. In the event any audits or assessments are concluded adversely to the Company, it may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, the Company may not be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. In addition, changes in the amount of the Company's total and foreign source taxable income may also limit the Company's ability to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing, and are subject to the interpretation of governmental agencies.\nThe Company collects and remits value-added taxes and sales taxes in jurisdictions and states in which it has determined that nexus exists. Other states may claim, from time to time, that the Company has state-related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require the Company to collect and remit value-added taxes and sales taxes in their state, which would increase the Company's tax liability.\nDespite the Company's efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws and changes to the interpretations thereof, it may not be able to continue to operate in compliance with such laws. The Company may need to adjust its operating procedures in response to these interpretational changes, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the markets in which the Company operates may become highly inflationary.\nThe Company's international operations subject it to the risks associated with high levels inflation. A country is considered to have a highly inflationary economy if, among other qualitative factors, it has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. The functional currency in a highly inflationary economy is the U.S. dollar. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's financial statements and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses were reflected in the Company's earnings, which resulted in volatility within the its earnings, rather than as a component of comprehensive income within shareholders\u2019 equity. It could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition if the economy of other countries in which the Company does business are designated as highly inflationary.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of data could expose the Company to data loss, litigation and liability, and the Company's reputation could be significantly harmed.\nThe Company collects and retains large volumes of data from employees and independent distributors, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and its various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to the Company's business. The Company is subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the credit card industry. Maintaining compliance with these evolving regulations and requirements could be difficult and may increase the Company's expenses. In addition, a penetrated or\ncompromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, distributor or guest data which could harm the Company's reputation, disrupt its operations, or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nSystem failures could harm the Company's business.\nLike many companies, the Company's business is highly dependent upon its information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently the Company's operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurately tracking purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrences of natural disasters, security breaches or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in the Company's day-to-day operations that could adversely affect its business. A long-term failure or impairment of any of the Company's information systems could materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nBeginning in 2013, the Company began to significantly reinvest in information technology systems. Included within this plan is an Oracle ERP implementation program to provide the Company with a single integrated software solution that will integrate the Company\u2019s business process on a worldwide basis. The unsuccessful implementation or failure of the ERP program could significantly disrupt the Company's operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company could incur obligations relating to the activities of its independent distributors and contracted third-parties.\nThe Company sells its products worldwide to a sales force of independent distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to customers. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the Company contracts with third-parties to distribute its product and provide support services to its independent distributors. Independent distributors and contracted third-parties are not employees and operate their own business separate and apart from the Company, and the Company may not be able to control aspects of their activities that may impact its business. If local laws and regulations or the interpretation of locals laws and regulations change and require the Company to treat its independent distributors as employees, or if its independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates to be its employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, the Company may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment related taxes and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The Company's independent distributors also operate in jurisdictions where local legislation and governmental agencies require it to collect and remit taxes such as sales tax or value-added taxes. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold the Company responsible for false product or income related claims or the actions of an independent distributor. If the Company was found to be responsible for any of these issues related to its independent distributors, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company's independent distributors fail to comply with advertising laws, then its financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nThe advertisement of the Company's products is subject to extensive regulations in most of the markets in which the Company does business, including the United States. The Company's independent distributors may fail to comply with such regulations governing the advertising of the Company's products or business opportunity. In the U.S., the Company's products are sold principally as dietary supplements and cosmetics and are subject to rigorous FDA regulations limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made relating to the products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for the Company's products. In the U.S., the FTC is responsible for providing consumer protection by, among other things, investigating and initiating enforcement actions against business practices it deems deceptive or fraudulent. The FTC has in recent years investigated and initiated enforcement action against direct selling companies for misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent distributor within a company's compensation plan. Recently, private watchdog groups have increased their scrutiny of companies in the dietary supplement and direct selling industries with allegations of false or misleading product and earning claims. The goal of such private watchdog groups is to get the FTC to take enforcement action against business practices they believe are illegal. Despite the Company's efforts to train its independent distributors and its attempts to monitor its independent distributors\u2019 marketing materials, the Company cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations, including bans on therapeutic claims and earning claims. If the Company's independent distributors fail to comply with these restrictions, then the Company and its independent distributors could be subjected to claims of false advertising, misrepresentation, significant financial penalties, costly\nmandatory product recalls and relabeling requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in key management personnel could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company believes its success depends in part on its ability to retain its executive officers, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to its management team. The loss or limitation of any of its executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial position. The Company does not carry key man insurance on the lives of any of its executive officers.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively manage rapid growth in China, its operations could be harmed.\nIf the Company obtains the necessary licenses and approvals and its operations in China are successful and experiences rapid growth, the Company may be unable to successfully manage rapid expansion of manufacturing operations and a rapidly growing and dynamic sales force in China. If the Company is unable to effectively manage such growth and expansion of its sales force and manufacturing operations, the Company's government relations and public perception may be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may experience unintended negative effects from its independent distributor promotions or compensation plans.\nThe payment of volume incentives to the Company's independent distributors is its most significant expense. These incentives include commissions, bonuses and certain awards and prizes based on promotions and product sales levels. From time to time, the Company adjusts its compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales. The Company closely monitors the amount of volume incentives that are paid as a percentage of net sales, and may periodically adjust its compensation plan to prevent volume incentives from having a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, regulations in some countries in which the Company operates limit the amount of volume incentives that can be paid to its independent distributors, and the Company may, from time to time, modify its compensation plan in these countries to comply with such regulations. In addition to the compensation plan, the Company frequently designs and implements economic and non-economic incentives and promotions to motivate and reward its independent distributors. Changes to the Company's compensation plan, product pricing, or promotions and incentives may not be successful in achieving target levels of volume incentives as a percentage of net sales. Furthermore, such programs, promotions or incentives could result in unintended or unforeseen negative economic and non-economic consequences to the Company's business, such as higher than anticipated costs or difficulty in attracting and retaining independent distributors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nThe Company manufactures approximately 80 percent of the products sold at its manufacturing facility located in Spanish Fork, Utah. As a result, the Company is dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of its manufacturing facility in Spanish Fork and its distribution facilities throughout the country. The Company's manufacturing facilities and distribution facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to, among other things, earthquake, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as occurrence of significant equipment failures. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it would be expected to disrupt the Company's operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition as a result of personal injury or property damage, damaged relationships with its customers or incurring significant cost to repair or replace the facilities or systems lost.\nAs the primary manufacturer of its own products, the Company is subject to FDA regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices, which require the Company to maintain good manufacturing processes, including ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. The ingredient identification requirement, which requires the Company to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on its product labels within a narrow range, is particularly burdensome and difficult for the Company with respect to its product formulations, which contain many different ingredients. Compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing the Company's products. The Company's operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that the Company is not in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting the Company's ability to continue selling certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce some of its vitamins, mineral and other nutritional supplements, personal care products and certain other miscellaneous products in accordance with the Company's specifications and standards. These contract manufacturers are subject to the same risks as the Company's manufacturing facility as noted above. In addition, while the Company has implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that its contract manufacturers comply with its specifications and standards, the Company does not have full control over their manufacturing activities. Significant delays and defects in the Company's products resulting from the activities of its contract manufacturers may have an material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nAvailability and integrity of raw materials could become compromised.\nThe Company acquires all of its raw materials for the manufacture of its products from third-party suppliers. If the Company was to lose a significant supplier and experience difficulties in finding or transitioning to an alternative supplier, the Company could experience shortages or product back orders, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Suppliers may be unable to provide the Company with the raw materials in the quantities and at the appropriate quality that it requires or at a price the Company is willing to pay. The Company could incur delays caused by an interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events outside of the control of the Company and its suppliers.\nOccasionally, the Company's suppliers have experienced production difficulties with respect to its products, including the delivery of materials or products that do not meet the Company's quality control standards. These quality problems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition by causing stock outages or shortages of the Company's products.\nInventory obsolescence due to finite shelf lives could adversely affect the Company's business.\nTo provide a high level of product availability to its independent distributors and customers, the Company generally maintains a considerable inventory of raw materials in the United States and of finished goods in most countries in which it does business. The Company's inventories of both raw materials and finished goods have finite shelf lives. If the Company overestimates the demand for its products, the Company could experience significant write-downs of its inventory due to obsolescence. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm its distributor relationships and product sales and harm its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company's business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. The Company's continued success depends in part on its ability to anticipate and react to these changes, and the Company may not react in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. Furthermore, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions and enhancements. The Company's failure to accurately predict these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of its products, which in turn could harm its relationships with its independent distributors and cause the loss of sales. If the Company does not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of its customers in a timely manner, some of its products could be rendered obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business is involved in an industry with intense competition.\nThe Company operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of nutritional products. The market for these products is intensely competitive. Many of the Company's competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have better name recognition than the Company. The Company also relies on independent distributors to market and sell its products through direct selling techniques, as well as sponsoring other independent distributors. The Company competes with other direct selling companies to retain existing independent distributors and attract new independent distributors. In addition, the Company currently does not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and competitors may introduce products with the same or similar ingredients that the Company uses in its products. As a result, the Company may have difficulty differentiating its products from its competitors\u2019 product and other competing products that enter the nutritional market. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception.\nThe Company's ability to attract and retain independent distributors, as well as its ability to maintain or grow sales in the future, may be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception with regard to its industry, its competition, its direct selling model, the quality or efficacy of nutritional product supplements and ingredients, and its business generally, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability claims could harm the Company's business.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products that are ingested, the Company could face product liability claims if, among other things, the use of its products is alleged to result in injury to a consumer. The Company has accrued a reserve that it believes is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon the Company's history. Such reserve may prove to be insufficient if the outcome of a product liability claim against the Company is beyond its estimate of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business is subject to intellectual property risks.\nMost of the Company's products are not protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products generally make obtaining patent protection for the Company's products impractical. The Company has other intellectual property that it considers valuable, including trademarks for the Nature\u2019s Sunshine Products name and logo as well as the Synergy WorldWide name. The Company's efforts to protect its intellectual property may be unsuccessful and third parties may assert claims against the Company for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in the Company being required to obtain costly licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate its manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition.\nFailure of third party support could negatively impact the Company's sales and profitability.\nThe Company has contracted with third-parties in some of its markets to distribute its products and provide support services its independent distributors. The Company relies on these third parties to perform various required administrative functions in support of its independent distributors. Any failure of these third parties in this regard could result in the disruption of the Company's business in these markets and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 56945, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NATR"}
