{"cik": "876523", "company": "EZCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-12-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations, performance, development and results. Many of these risks are beyond our control. The following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business. If any of these risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not effectively remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in \"Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\" we identified and evaluated certain deficiencies in our IT general controls in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and have concluded that those deficiencies, collectively, represent a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2019.\nAs described in \"Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\" management believes it is taking the appropriate steps to remediate the underlying ITGC deficiencies, including allowing the controls to operate for a time period to produce sufficient testing sample sizes. If our remediation efforts are insufficient, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and the market value of our publicly traded Class A Non-Voting Common Stock (\u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d).\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations affecting our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur products and services are subject to regulation under various laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate (see \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d), and adverse legislation or regulations could be adopted in any such country or jurisdiction. If such legislation or regulation is adopted in any particular jurisdiction, we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new rules and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings. In any case, if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new rules, we may decide to close or consolidate stores, resulting in decreased revenues, earnings and assets. Further, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or orders to cease or suspend operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNegative characterizations of the pawn industry by consumer advocates, media or others could result in increased legislative or regulatory activity, could adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded stock, or could make it harder to operate our business successfully.\nMany of the legislative and regulatory efforts that are adverse to the pawn industry are the result of negative characterization of the pawn industry by consumer advocacy groups, members of the media or others that focus on the cost of pawn loans or instances of pawn operators purchasing stolen property or accepting it as pawn collateral. We can give no assurance that there will not be further negative characterizations of our industry or that legislative or regulatory efforts to restrict the availability of pawn loans or otherwise regulate pawn operations will not be successful despite significant customer demand for such services. Such efforts, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance.\nFurthermore, negative characterizations of our industry could limit the number of investors who are willing to hold our Class A Common Stock, which may adversely affect its market value; limit sources of the debt or equity financing that we need in order to conduct our operations and achieve our strategic growth objectives; or make it harder for us to attract, hire and retain talented executives and other key team members.\nA significant portion of our U.S. business is concentrated in Texas and Florida.\nAs of September 30, 2019, more than 60% of our U.S. pawn stores were located in Texas (42%) and Florida (19%), and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The legislative, regulatory and general business environment in Texas and Florida has been relatively favorable for our pawn business activities, but a negative legislative or regulatory change in either of those states could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance. Further, as discussed below, areas in Texas and Florida where we have significant operations are particularly susceptible to hurricane and tropical storm activity.\nWe have significant operations in Latin America, and changes in the business, regulatory, political or social climate could impact our operations there, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth plans.\nWe own and operate a significant number of pawn stores in Latin America (primarily Mexico, but also Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Peru). Further, our growth plans include potential expansion in those countries as well as potentially other countries in Latin America. Doing business in those countries exposes us to risks related to political instability, corruption, economic volatility, drug cartel and gang-related violence, social unrest including riots and looting, tax and foreign investment policies, public safety and security concerns, and uncertain application of laws and regulations. Consequently, actions or events in any of those countries that are beyond our control could restrict our ability to operate there or otherwise adversely affect the profitability of those operations. Furthermore, changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in any of those countries, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations and cash flows. For a description of the current regulatory environment in the Latin American countries in which we operate, see \u201cMexico Regulations\u201d and \u201cOther Latin America Regulations\u201d under \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d\nA significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position.\nGold jewelry comprises a large portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory. Pawn service charges, sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions. A decline in the availability of gold or our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could impact our business. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of decreases in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known; however, a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales, sales margins, pawn loan balances and pawn service charges.\nA significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position.\nWe have foreign operations in Latin America (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru) and Canada, and an equity investment in Australia. Our assets and investments in, and earnings and dividends from each of these countries must be translated to U.S. dollars from their respective functional currencies. A significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in U.S. dollars, resulting in a potentially material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in our sales, pawn loan balances, sales margins and pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics. Changes in any of these metrics, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment, competitive pressures, changes in customers\u2019 tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations.\nAchievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores.\nOur expansion strategy includes acquiring existing stores and opening de novo store locations. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, while the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment. The achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability to attract, train and retain qualified team members. Failure to achieve our expansion goals could adversely affect our prospects, future results of operations and future cash flows.\nOur development of a digital platform to provide transaction and lending services, and the commercialization of that platform, may not be successful.\nWe are investing in the design and development of a digital platform to enhance our relationships with customers and provide them access to a broader range of financial products and services. There can be no assurance that our efforts to develop and launch such a digital platform will be successful or, if launched, that the platform will be accepted by existing customers or attract new customers. Consequently, we may not realize the expected return on our investment.\nOur continued success is dependent on our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate talented executives and other key team members.\nTo remain competitive, sustain our success over the long-term and realize our strategic goals, we need to attract, hire, retain and motivate talented executives and other key team members to fill existing positions and reduce our succession risks. If our recruitment and retention programs (including compensation programs) are not viewed as competitive, or we fail to develop and implement appropriate succession plans for key executive positions, our results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our long-term strategic goals, will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to collect the remaining amounts owed under the Grupo Finmart promissory notes is dependent on the success and performance of Grupo Finmart and its parent company, AlphaCredit, and we continue to have limited indemnity obligations to AlphaCredit for pre-closing taxes.\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of our 94%-owned subsidiary, Prestaciones Finmart, S.A.P.I. de C.V., SOFOM, E.N.R. (\"Grupo Finmart\") to Alpha Holding, S.A. de C.V. (\u201cAlphaCredit\u201d) in September 2016, we received two \u201cParent Loan Notes\u201d in the original principal amount of $60.2 million. As of September 30, 2019, the outstanding principal balance on the Parent Loan Notes had been fully repaid by Grupo Finmart. As of that date, Grupo Finmart remained obligated to pay approximately $8.0 million of deferred compensation fee due to us in fiscal 2020. Our ability to recover the remaining amounts due under the Parent Loan Notes is dependent on the success and performance of the business of Grupo Finmart (as primary obligor) and its parent AlphaCredit (as guarantor). To the extent that Grupo Finmart and AlphaCredit are unable to repay these amounts, our assets, financial performance and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement relating to the sale of Grupo Finmart, we remain obligated to indemnify AlphaCredit for any \u201cpre-closing taxes\u201d (i.e., tax obligations arising from the Grupo Finmart business that are attributable to periods prior to the completion of the sale in September 2016). Those obligations continue until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the pre-closing periods. In August 2019, AlphaCredit notified us of a potential indemnity claim for certain pre-closing taxes, but the nature, extent and validity of such claim has yet to be determined.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are currently subject to various litigation and regulatory actions, and additional actions could arise in the future. Potential actions range from claims and assertions arising in the ordinary course of business (such as contract, customer or employment disputes) to more significant corporate-level matters or shareholder litigation. All of these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, which could include monetary damages, fines and penalties or other relief. Any unfavorable ruling or outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or could negatively affect our reputation. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of shareholder litigation that is in the final stages of resolution.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, we are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers for costs and liabilities they incur in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company. Consequently, if a proceeding names or involves any of our directors or officers, then (subject to certain exceptions) we are generally obligated to pay or reimburse the cost or liability such director or officer incurs as a result of such proceeding (including defense costs, judgments and amounts paid in settlement). We maintain management liability insurance that protects us from much of this potential indemnification exposure, as well as potential costs or liabilities that may be directly incurred by the Company in some cases. However, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and there may be elements of the costs or liabilities that are not covered under the insurance policies. In addition, to the extent that our ultimate liability in any such proceeding (or any combination of proceedings that are included in the same policy year) exceeds the management liability policy limits, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOne person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and generally controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly traded non-voting stock.\nPhillip E. Cohen is the beneficial owner of all our Class B Voting Common Stock, and all our publicly traded stock is non-voting stock. Consequently, stockholders other than Mr. Cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except in limited circumstances as required by law. Further, our Bylaws currently provide that the voting stockholder may appoint or remove officers or take any other action that the Board of Directors may take with respect to officers under the Bylaws. The lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded Class A Common Stock.\nIn September 2019, Mr. Cohen joined the Board of Directors and was appointed Executive Chairman. As a member of the Board, Mr. Cohen is entitled to vote on all matters requiring approval of the Board. Our Bylaws currently provide that the\npresence of all directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and that any act of the Board of Directors requires a unanimous approval of all directors. Consequently, Mr. Cohen, as is the case with each of the other directors, has the ability to block actions of the Board. Mr. Cohen has agreed that, as a member of the Board of Directors, he will not participate in any Board vote regarding his position as Executive Chairman.\nOur acquisitions, investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, investments and other transactions. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment, that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business, or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, investments or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors. Furthermore, acquisitions, investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business, and there are inherent risks in integrating and operating any acquired business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have a significant firearms business in the U.S., which exposes us to increased risks of regulatory fines and penalties, lawsuits and related liabilities.\nAs discussed under \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulations - Pawn Regulations,\u201d some of our stores in the U.S. conduct pawn and retail transactions involving firearms, which may be associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits. We may be subject to lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms that we sell, including actions by persons attempting to recover damages from firearms retailers relating to misuse of firearms. We may also incur fines, penalties or liabilities, or have our federal firearms licenses revoked or suspended, if we fail to properly perform required background checks for, and otherwise record and report, firearms transactions. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nOur business is subject to team member and third-party robberies, burglaries and other crimes at the store level.\nThe nature of our business requires us to maintain significant cash on hand, loan collateral and inventories in our stores. Consequently, we are subject to loss of cash or merchandise as a result of robberies, burglaries, thefts, riots, looting and other criminal activity in our stores. Further, we could be subject to liability to customers or other third parties as a result of such activities. While we maintain asset protection and monitoring programs to mitigate these risks, as well as insurance programs to protect against catastrophic loss or exposure, there can be no assurance that these crimes will not occur or that such losses will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and other general business laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the U.S. and the General Law of Administrative Responsibility in Mexico. We are also subject to various laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering or the financial support of terrorism or other illegal activity, including the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act in the U.S. and The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds From Illegal Sources in Mexico. See \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d Further, our business is expanding in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business and political environments.\nWhile we maintain controls and policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, these controls and policies may prove to be less than effective. If team members, agents or other persons for whose conduct we are held responsible violate our policies, we may be subject to severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements or in access to capital markets or other financing and transactional banking sources could limit our ability to achieve our plans.\nA significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of debt or equity financing could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. Our ability to obtain debt or equity financing,\nincluding the possible refinancing of existing indebtedness, will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and the willingness of financing sources to make capital available to us at acceptable rates and terms. The inability to access capital at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur access to transactional banking services, as well as international wire services between certain countries, is an ongoing business requirement. Inability in accessing or maintaining transactional banking or wire services could lead to increased costs or the inability to efficiently manage our cash as we would be required to seek alternative banking services or obtain services from several regional or local retail banks.\nChanges in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans.\nWe encounter significant competition from other pawn stores, consumer lending companies, other retailers, online retailers and auction sites, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences, such as aggressive marketing and pricing practices, could adversely affect our operations. In Mexico, we compete directly with certain pawn stores owned and operated by government affiliated or sponsored non-profit foundations, and the government could take actions that would harm our ability to compete in that market.\nOur continued profitability and growth plans are dependent on our ability to successfully design or acquire, deploy and maintain information technology and other business systems to support our current business and our planned growth and expansion.\nThe success of our business depends on the efficiency and reliability of our information technology and business systems and related controls, including the point-of-sale system utilized in our store locations. If access to our technology infrastructure is impaired (as may occur with a computer virus, a cyber-attack or other intentional disruption by a third party, natural disaster, telecommunications system failure, electrical system failure or lost connectivity), or if there are flaws in the design or roll-out of new or refreshed technology systems (such as our point-of-sale system), we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business in a timely and efficient manner. An infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue. We consider security risks from multiple viewpoints, including physical security as well as security of infrastructure and databases. As our technology infrastructure continues to evolve from on premise to cloud service providers, we continue to assess the security of such infrastructure, including third party service providers.\nWe collect and store a variety of sensitive customer information, and breaches in data security or other cyber-attacks could harm our business operations and lead to reputational damage.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we collect and store on our information technology systems a variety of information about our customers, including sensitive personal identifying and financial information. We may not have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our service providers, our customers or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increased costs, including costs to hire additional personnel, purchase additional protection technologies, train team members and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology we use to protect data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. We could be subject to fines, penalties and liabilities if any such information is misappropriated from our systems or we otherwise fail to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Further, any such data security breach could cause damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe invested in Cash Converters International Limited for strategic reasons. We may be required in future periods to impair our investment and recognize related investment losses, as we have done in the past, and we may not realize a positive return on the investment.\nWe currently have a significant investment in Cash Converters International, which is a publicly traded company based in Australia. We made the initial investment in November 2009 and have made incremental investments periodically since then, including a $14.0 million investment in June 2018 to increase our ownership percentage to 34.75%. The success of this strategic investment is dependent on a variety of factors, including Cash Converters International\u2019s business performance and the market\u2019s assessment of that performance. Cash Converters International\u2019s business has been under significant pressure for the past several years, principally as a result of regulatory changes in Australia and the United Kingdom and related class action litigation. After an analysis of Cash Converters International\u2019s stock price performance and other factors, we determined that the fair value of our investment in Cash Converters International at September 30, 2019 was less than its carrying value but that the impairment was not \u201cother than temporary\u201d primarily due to Cash Converters\u2019 October 2019 agreement to settle a class\naction lawsuit and the resulting rebound in Cash Converters\u2019 stock price above its recorded value. Accordingly, we did not record an impairment at that date. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d If the fair value of our investment declines and we determine that such decline is other-than-temporary, we may be required to further impair our investment and recognize the related investment loss, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in the period of impairment. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of some or all of our investment in Cash Converters International on favorable terms, should we decide to do so in the future.\nOur ability to recover our investment in RDC is heavily dependent on RDC's success and performance, including its ability to obtain further debt or equity financing.\nWe have an investment in Rich Data Corporation (\u201cRDC\u201d), a previously consolidated variable interest entity. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d Our ability to recover our investment in RDC is heavily dependent on RDC's success and performance, potentially including its ability to obtain further debt or equity financing. To the extent that RDC is not successful, we may be required in future periods to impair our investment and recognize related investment losses.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses, including losses related to natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. Not all such losses will be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant operations located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes (notably the Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of Florida, the Gulf Coast regions of Texas including Houston, as well as Mexico and Central America). Certain areas of our operations are also susceptible to other types of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and tornadoes. As noted above, not all physical damage that we incur as a result of any such natural disaster will be covered by insurance due to policy deductibles and risk retentions. In addition, natural disasters could have a significant negative impact on our business beyond physical damage to property, including a reduction of our loan portfolio, inventory, pawn service charges and merchandise sales. Only limited portions, if any, of those negative impacts will be covered by applicable business interruption insurance policies. As a result, geographically isolated natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance.\nWe may face business interruptions or other adverse effects on our operations and growth.\nOur business and operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather, natural disaster, power loss, acts of violence, terrorist attacks, war, civil unrest or similar events. Further, we may experience information technology or other business systems disruptions. Such events could impair our customers' access to our business, impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax laws in the U.S. or other countries, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any of these jurisdictions subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill was $300.5 million, or approximately 28% of our total assets as of September 30, 2019. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 350-20-35, we test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for potential impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a\nreporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter utilizing the income approach. This approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values for each reporting unit (discounted using a market participant perspective) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment exists. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. See Note 1 and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of our annual impairment tests performed for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2019. Changes in the economic conditions or regulatory environment could negatively affect our key assumptions. Future negative developments including a decline in merchandise sales or demand for our products, a decline in precious metal commodity values, or inflation in costs relative to revenues in our Latin American operations in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Peru could lead to potential impairment of the $34.5 million in goodwill recorded in our \u201cGPMX\u201d reporting unit within our Latin America reporting segment. There were no impairments of goodwill during fiscal 2019, but there may be impairments in the future should events or circumstances as noted above change.\nWe also perform periodic reviews for potential impairment of other intangible assets. At September 30, 2019, we determined an impairment had occurred in the fair value of an acquired trade name of a previously acquired entity and recorded a related impairment of $0.6 million. If future and expected performance of acquired entities drops below current expectations, we may recognize further impairments of recorded trade names in future periods, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. At September 30, 2019, the net book value of recorded trade names, most of which were acquired after fiscal 2017, was $19.9 million.\nThe conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have outstanding a total of $316.3 million of convertible notes. See Note 8 of Note to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d If the conversion feature of any of those convertible notes is triggered, holders will be entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time during specified periods. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may be required, or may choose, to settle the obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of our convertible notes into stock may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf it were to occur, the conversion of convertible notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of Class A Common Stock upon conversion. Any sales in the public market of such shares could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our Class A Common Stock could depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have a limited number of unreserved shares available for future issuance, which may limit our ability to conduct future financings and other transactions and our ability to offer equity awards to management.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 100 million shares of Class A Common Stock. Taking into consideration the shares that are issued and outstanding, as well as the shares that have been reserved for issuance pursuant to convertible notes, warrants and outstanding equity incentive compensation awards and the conversion of the Class B Common Stock, we had approximately 1,000,000 shares of authorized Class A Common Stock available for other uses as of September 30, 2019. Therefore, our ability to issue shares of Class A Common Stock (other than pursuant to the existing reserved-for commitments), or securities or instruments that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A Common Stock, may be limited until such time that additional authorized, unissued and unreserved shares become available or unless we determine that we are unlikely to issue all of the shares that are currently reserved. During this time, for example, our ability to complete equity or equity-linked financings or other transactions (including strategic acquisitions) that involve the issuance or potential issuance of Class A Common Stock may be limited. Further, our ability to offer equity-based compensation to our management team may also be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to align management\u2019s incentives with stockholders or attract and retain key management personnel.\nWe face other risks discussed under \"Part II, Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\"", "PERMNO": 76798, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "EZPW"}
