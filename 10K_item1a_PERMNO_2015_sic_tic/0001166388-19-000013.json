{"cik": "1166388", "company": "VERINT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nMany of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risks and uncertainties. The factors described below are risks that could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may have a material adverse impact on our future operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition, Markets, and Operations\nOur business is impacted by changes in general economic conditions, and information technology and government spending in particular.\nOur business is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. Slowdowns, recessions, economic instability, political unrest, armed conflicts, or natural disasters around the world may cause companies and governments to delay, reduce, or even cancel planned spending. In particular, declines in information technology spending and limited or reduced government budgets have affected the markets for our solutions in both the Customer Engagement market and the Cyber Intelligence market in certain periods and in certain regions. For the year ended January 31, 2019, approximately one third of our business was generated from contracts with various governments around the world, including national, regional, and local government agencies. We expect that government contracts will continue to be a significant source of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Macroeconomic changes, such as rising interest rates, significant changes in commodity prices, actual or threatened trade wars, or the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to exit the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) may also impact demand for our products. Brexit could, among other outcomes, also disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K. and the E.U., have a detrimental impact on the U.K. and E.U. economy, and provide some disruption to business activities in all sectors. Customers or partners who are facing business challenges, reduced budgets, liquidity issues, or other impacts from such macroeconomic changes are also more likely to defer purchase decisions or cancel or reduce orders, as well as to delay or default on payments. If customers or partners significantly reduce their spending with us or significantly delay or fail to make payments to us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards and challenges, and changing market potential from area to area, and if we cannot anticipate and react to such changes our results may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards and challenges. The introduction of products embodying new technology, new delivery platforms, the commoditization of older technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and technological hurdles can exert pricing pressure on existing products and services and/or render them unmarketable or obsolete. For example, in our Cyber Intelligence business, the increasing complexity and sophistication of security threats and prevalence of encrypted communications have created significantly greater challenges for our customers and for our solutions to address. In our Customer Engagement business, we see a continued shift to cloud-based solutions as well as market saturation for more mature solutions. Moreover, the market potential and growth rates of the markets we serve are not uniform and are evolving. It is critical to our success that we are able to anticipate and respond to changes in technology and industry standards and new customer challenges by consistently developing new, innovative, high-quality products and services that meet or exceed the changing needs of our customers. We must also successfully identify, enter, and appropriately prioritize areas of growing market potential, including by launching, successfully executing, and driving demand for new and enhanced solutions and services, while simultaneously preserving our legacy businesses and migrating away from areas of commoditization. We must also develop and maintain the expertise of our employees as the needs of the market and our solutions evolve. If we are unable to execute on these strategic priorities, we may lose market share or experience slower growth, and our profitability and other results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIntense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth.\nWe face aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all of our markets, making it difficult to maintain market share, remain profitable, invest, and grow. We are also encountering new competitors as we expand into new markets or as new competitors expand into ours. Our competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies, better respond to changes in customer needs or preferences, better identify and enter into new areas of growth, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Some of our competitors have, in relation to us, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer standing relationships with customers, superior brand recognition, superior margins, and significantly greater financial or other resources, especially in new markets we may enter. Consolidation among our competitors may also improve their competitive position. We also face competition from solutions developed internally by our customers or partners. To the extent that we cannot compete effectively, our market share and results of operations, would be materially adversely affected.\nBecause price and related terms are key considerations for many of our customers, we may have to accept less-favorable payment terms, lower the prices of our products and services, and/or reduce our cost structure, including reducing headcount or investment in R&D, in order to remain competitive. If we are forced to take these kinds of actions to remain competitive in the short-term, such actions may adversely impact our ability to execute and compete in the long-term.\nOur future success depends on our ability to properly manage investments in our business and operations, execute on growth initiatives, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure.\nA key element of our long-term strategy is to continue to invest in and grow our business and operations, both organically and through acquisitions. Investments in, among other things, new markets, new products, solutions, and technologies, R&D, infrastructure and systems, geographic expansion, and headcount are critical components for achieving this strategy. However, such investments and efforts present challenges and risks and may not be successful, especially in new areas or new markets in which we have little or no experience, and even if successful, may negatively impact our profitability in the short-term. To be successful in such efforts, we must be able to properly allocate limited investment dollars and other resources, prioritize among opportunities, projects, and implementations, balance the extent and timing of investments with the associated impact on profitability, balance our focus between new areas or new markets and the operation and servicing of our legacy businesses and customers, capture efficiencies and economies of scale, and compete in the new areas or new markets, or with the new solutions, in which we have invested.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute on other growth initiatives we are pursuing. For example, in our Customer Engagement segment, in addition to the other factors described in this section, our revenue and profitability objectives are highly dependent on our ability to continue to expand our cloud business and cloud operations, including keeping pace with the market transition to cloud-based software, making new sales, and managing the conversion of our maintenance base. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, in addition to the other factors described in this section, our profitability objectives are highly\ndependent on our ability to continue to shift our product mix towards software and away from professional services and hardware resales.\nOur success also depends on our ability to effectively and efficiently enhance our existing operations. Our existing infrastructure, systems, security, processes, and personnel may not be adequate for our current or future needs. System upgrades or new implementations can be complex, time-consuming, and expensive and we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems during or following such implementations, including among others, potential disruptions in our operations or financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to properly manage our investments, execute on growth initiatives, and enhance our existing operations and infrastructure, our results of operations and market share may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable targets for acquisition or investment, or complete acquisitions or investments on terms acceptable to us, which could negatively impact our ability to implement our growth strategy.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we have made a number of acquisitions and investments and expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in the future. In many areas, we have seen the market for acquisitions become more competitive and valuations increase. Our competitors also continue to make acquisitions in or adjacent to our markets and may have greater resources than we do, enabling them to pay higher prices. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to identify suitable acquisition or investment targets or to consummate acquisitions or investments once identified on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to execute on our acquisition strategy, we may not be able to achieve our long-term growth strategy, may lose market share, or may lose our leadership position in one or more of our markets.\nOur acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business, operations, and financial position.\nAcquisitions and investments are an important part of our growth strategy. Acquisitions and investments present significant challenges and risks to a buyer, including with respect to the transaction process, the integration of the acquired company or assets, and the post-closing operation of the acquired company or assets. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges and risks, we may experience both a loss on the investment and damage to our existing business, operations, financial results, and valuation.\nThe potential challenges and risks associated with acquisitions and investments include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on our strategic position and our reputation, including the impact of the market\u2019s reception of the transaction;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the acquisition on our financial position and results, including our ability to maintain and/or grow our revenue and profitability;\n\u2022\nrisk that we fail to successfully implement our business plan for the combined business, including plans to accelerate growth or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, such as synergies or economies of scale;\n\u2022\nrisk of unforeseen or underestimated challenges or liabilities associated with an acquired company\u2019s business or operations;\n\u2022\nmanagement distraction from our existing operations and priorities;\n\u2022\nrisk that the market does not accept the integrated product portfolio;\n\u2022\nchallenges in reconciling business practices or in integrating product development activities, logistics, or information technology and other systems and processes;\n\u2022\nretention risk with respect to key customers, suppliers, and employees and challenges in integrating and training new employees;\n\u2022\nchallenges in complying with newly applicable laws and regulations, including obtaining or retaining required approvals, licenses, and permits; and\n\u2022\npotential impact on our systems, processes, and internal controls over financial reporting.\nAcquisitions and/or investments may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the expenditure of available cash, and amortization expenses or write-downs related to intangible assets such as goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. Investments in immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies have an especially high degree of risk, with the possibility that we may lose our entire investment or incur unexpected liabilities. Transactions that are not immediately accretive to earnings may make it more difficult for us to maintain satisfactory profitability levels or compliance with the maximum leverage ratio covenant under the revolving credit facility under our senior credit agreement (the \u201c2017 Credit Agreement\u201d). Large or costly acquisitions or investments may also diminish our capital resources and liquidity or limit our ability to engage in additional transactions for a period of time.\nThe foregoing risks may be magnified as the cost, size, or complexity of an acquisition or acquired company increases, where the acquired company\u2019s products, market, or business are materially different from ours, or where more than one transaction or integration is occurring simultaneously or within a concentrated period of time. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in making additional acquisitions in the future or in integrating or executing on our business plan for existing or future acquisitions.\nSales processes for sophisticated solutions and a broad solution portfolio like ours present significant challenges.\nWe offer our customers a broad solution portfolio with the flexibility to purchase a single point solution, which can be expanded over time, or a larger more comprehensive system. Regardless of the size of a customer\u2019s purchase, many of our solutions are sophisticated and may represent a significant investment for our customers. As a result, our sales cycles can range in duration from as little as a few weeks to more than a year. Our larger sales typically require a minimum of a few months to consummate. As the length or complexity of a sales process increases, so does the risk of successfully closing the sale. Larger sales are often made by competitive bid, which also increases the time and uncertainty associated with such opportunities. Customers may also require education on the value and functionality of our solutions as part of the sales process, further extending the time frame and uncertainty of the process.\nLonger sales cycles, competitive bid processes, and the need to educate customers means that:\n\u2022\nThere is greater risk of customers deferring, scaling back, or canceling sales as a result of, among other things, their receipt of a competitive proposal, changes in budgets and purchasing priorities, or the introduction or anticipated introduction of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors during the process.\n\u2022\nWe may make a significant investment of time and money in opportunities that do not come to fruition, which investments may not be usable or recoverable in future projects.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to bid on a project in advance of the completion of its design or be required to begin working on a project in advance of finalizing a sale, in either case, increasing the risk of unforeseen technological difficulties or cost overruns.\n\u2022\nWe face greater downside risks if we do not correctly and efficiently deploy limited personnel and financial resources and convert such sales opportunities into orders.\nLarger solution sales also require greater expertise in sales execution and transaction implementation than more basic product sales, including in establishing and maintaining appropriate contacts and relationships with customers and partners, product development, project management and implementation, staffing, integration, services, and support. Our ability to develop, sell, implement, and support larger solutions and a broad solution portfolio is a competitive differentiator for us, which provides for diversification and more opportunities for growth, but also requires greater investment for us and presents challenges, including, among others, challenges associated with competition for limited internal resources, complex customer requirements, and project deadlines.\nAfter the completion of a sale, our customers or partners may need assistance from us in making full use of the functionality of our solutions, in realizing all of their benefits, or in implementation generally. If we are unable to assist our customers and partners in realizing the benefits they expect from our solutions and products, demand for our solutions and products may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nThe extended time frame and uncertainty associated with many of our sales opportunities also makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenues (and attendant budgeting and guidance decisions) and increases the volatility of our operating\nresults from period to period. Our ability to forecast and the volatility of our operating results is also impacted by the fact that pricing, margins, and other deal terms may vary substantially from transaction to transaction, especially across business lines. The terms of our transactions, including with respect to pricing, future deliverables, delivery model (e.g., perpetual license versus SaaS), and termination clauses, also impact the timing of our ability to recognize revenue. We recognize SaaS revenue over the term of the SaaS subscription, so as our SaaS revenue continues to grow and becomes a more significant component of our overall revenue, we expect a greater amount of our revenue to be recognized over longer periods, in some cases several years, as compared to the way revenue is recognized for perpetual licenses. This change in the pattern of recognition also means that increases or decreases in SaaS subscription activity impacts the amount of revenue recognized in both current and future periods. Because these transaction-specific factors are difficult to predict in advance, this also complicates the forecasting of revenue and creates challenges in managing our cloud transition and revenue mix. The deferral or loss of one or more significant orders or a delay in a large implementation can also materially adversely affect our operating results, especially in a given quarter. Larger transactions also increase the risk that our revenue and profitability becomes concentrated in a given period or over time. As with other software-focused companies, a large amount of our quarterly business tends to come in the last few weeks, or even the last few days, of each quarter. This trend has also complicated the process of accurately predicting revenue and other operating results, particularly on a quarterly basis. Finally, our business is subject to seasonal factors that may also cause our results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain our relationships with third parties that market and sell our products, our business and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\nApproximately half of our sales are made through partners, distributors, resellers, and systems integrators. To remain successful, we must maintain our existing relationships as well as identify and establish new relationships with such third parties. We must often compete with other suppliers for these relationships and our competitors often seek to establish exclusive relationships with these sales channels or to become a preferred partner for them. Our ability to establish and maintain these relationships is based on, among other things, factors that are similar to those on which we compete for end customers, including features, functionality, ease of use, installation and maintenance, and price. Even if we are able to secure such relationships on terms we find acceptable, there is no assurance that we will be able to realize the benefits we anticipate. Some of our channel partners may also compete with us or have affiliates that compete with us, or may also partner with our competitors or offer our products and those of our competitors as alternatives when presenting proposals to end customers. Our ability to achieve our revenue goals and growth depends to a significant extent on maintaining, enabling, and adding to these sales channels, and if we are unable to do so, our business and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\nFor certain products, components, or services, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, and partners, which may create significant exposure for us.\nAlthough we generally use standard parts and components in our products, we do rely on non-affiliated suppliers and OEM partners for certain non-standard products or components which may be critical to our products, including both hardware and software, and on manufacturers of assemblies that are incorporated into our products. We also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products or components, in some cases, by or from companies that may compete with us or work with our competitors. While we endeavor to use larger, more established suppliers, manufacturers, and partners wherever possible, in some cases, these providers may be smaller, less established companies, particularly in the case of new or unique technologies that we have not developed internally.\nIf any of these suppliers, manufacturers, or partners experience financial, operational, manufacturing, or quality assurance difficulties, cease production or sale, or there is any other disruption in our supply, including as a result of the acquisition of a supplier or partner by a competitor, we will be required to locate alternative sources of supply or manufacturing, to internally develop the applicable technologies, to redesign our products, and/or to remove certain features from our products, any of which would be likely to increase expenses, create delivery delays, and negatively impact our sales. Although we endeavor to establish contractual protections with key providers, including source code escrows (where needed), warranties, and indemnities, we may not be successful in obtaining adequate protections, these agreements may be short-term in duration, and the counterparties may be unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections. Moreover, these types of contractual protections offer limited practical benefits to us in the event our relationship with a key provider is interrupted.\nWe also rely on third parties to provide certain services to us or to our customers, including hosting partners and providers of other cloud-based services. We make contractual commitments to customers on the basis of these relationships and, in some cases, also entrust these providers with both our own sensitive data as well as the sensitive data of our customers (which may include sensitive end customer data). If these third-party providers do not perform as expected or encounter service disruptions, cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other difficulties, we or our customers may be materially and adversely affected,\nincluding, among other things, by facing increased costs, potential liability to customers, end customers, or other third parties, regulatory issues, and reputational harm. If it is necessary to migrate these services to other providers as a result of poor performance, security issues or considerations, or other financial or operational factors, it could result in service disruptions to our customers and significant time, expense, or exposure to us, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we cannot retain and recruit qualified personnel, our ability to operate and grow our business may be impaired.\nWe depend on the continued services of our management and employees to run and grow our business. To remain successful and to grow, we need to retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees, including in new markets and growth areas we may enter. Retention is an industry issue given the competitive technology labor market and as the millennial workforce continues to value multiple company experience over long tenure. As we grow, we must also enhance and expand our management team to execute on new and larger agendas and challenges. The market for qualified personnel is competitive in the geographies in which we operate and may be limited especially in areas of emerging technology. We may be at a disadvantage to larger companies with greater brand recognition or financial resources or to start-ups or other emerging companies in trending market sectors. Work visa restrictions, especially in the U.S., have also become significantly tighter in recent years, making it difficult or impossible to source qualified personnel from other countries or even to hire those already in the U.S. on current visas. Efforts we engage in to establish operations in new geographies where additional talent may be available, potentially at a lower cost, may be unsuccessful or fail to result in the desired cost savings.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel when and where they are needed, our ability to operate and grow our business could be impaired. Moreover, if we are not able to properly balance investment in personnel with sales, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nBecause we have significant foreign operations and business, we are subject to geopolitical and other risks that could materially adversely affect our results.\nWe have significant operations and business outside the United States, including sales, research and development, manufacturing, customer services and support, and administrative services. The countries in which we have our most significant foreign operations include Israel, the United Kingdom, India, Cyprus, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil and the Netherlands. We also generate significant revenue from more than a dozen foreign countries, and smaller amounts of revenue from many more, including a number of emerging markets. We intend to continue to grow our business internationally.\nOur foreign operations are, and any future foreign growth will be, subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical, security, and economic instability or corruption;\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with both international and local laws and regulations, including those related to trade compliance, anti-corruption, information security, data privacy and protection, tax, labor, currency restrictions, and other requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferences in tax regimes and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nproduct customization or localization issues;\n\u2022\npreferences for or policies and procedures that protect local suppliers;\n\u2022\nlegal uncertainties regarding intellectual property rights or rights and obligations generally; and\n\u2022\nchallenges or delays in collection of accounts receivable.\nAny or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nConditions in and our relationship to Israel may materially adversely affect our operations and personnel and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or engage in certain transactions.\nWe have significant operations in Israel, including R&D, manufacturing, sales, and support. Conflicts and political, economic, and/or military conditions in Israel and the Middle East region have affected and may in the future affect our operations in\nIsrael. Violence within Israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, including the Palestinians or Iran, may impede our ability to manufacture, sell, and support our products or engage in R&D, or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. Many of our employees in Israel are required to perform annual compulsory military service and are subject to being called to active duty at any time. Hostilities involving Israel may also result in the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRestrictive laws, policies, or practices in certain countries directed toward Israel, Israeli goods, or companies having operations in Israel may also limit our ability to sell some of our products in certain countries.\nWe receive grants from the IIA for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel. The availability in any given year of these IIA grants depends on IIA approval of the projects and related budgets that we submit to the IIA each year. The Israeli law under which these IIA grants are made limits our ability to manufacture products, or transfer technologies, developed using these grants outside of Israel. This may limit our ability to engage in certain outsourcing or business combination transactions involving these products or require us to pay significant royalties or fees to the IIA in order to obtain any IIA consent that may be required in connection with such transactions.\nIsraeli tax requirements may also place practical limitations on our ability to sell or engage in other transactions involving our Israeli companies or assets, to restructure our Israeli business, or to access funds in Israel.\nPolitical factors related to our business or operations may adversely affect us.\nWe may experience negative publicity, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts on our business as a result of offering certain types of Cyber Intelligence solutions or if we sell such solutions to countries or customers that are considered disfavored by the media or political or social rights organizations, even where such activities or transactions are permissible under applicable law. The risk of these adverse impacts may also result in lost opportunities that impact our results of operations.\nSome of our subsidiaries maintain security clearances domestically and abroad in connection with the development, marketing, sale, and/or support of our Cyber Intelligence solutions. These clearances are reviewed from time to time by these countries and could be deactivated, including for political reasons unrelated to the merits of our solutions, such as the list of countries we do business with or the fact that our local entity is controlled by or affiliated with an entity based in another country. If we lose our security clearances in a particular country, we may be unable to sell our Cyber Intelligence solutions for secure projects in that country and might also experience greater challenges in selling such solutions even for non-secure projects in that country. Even if we are able to obtain and maintain applicable security clearances, government customers may decline to purchase our Cyber Intelligence solutions if they were not developed or manufactured in that country or if they were developed or manufactured in other countries that are considered disfavored by such country.\nContracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\nWe provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes, adherence to complex procurement regulations, and other government-specific contractual requirements, including possible renegotiation or termination at the election of the government customer. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\nWe are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could negatively impact our business.\nOur business and operations are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in the United States and abroad, including, among other things, with respect to trade compliance, anti-corruption, information security, data privacy and protection, tax, labor, government contracts, and cyber intelligence. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be onerous, time-consuming, and expensive, especially where these requirements are inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or where the jurisdictional reach of certain requirements is not clearly defined or seeks to reach across national borders. Regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may make it difficult or impossible to do business in another jurisdiction. We may also be unsuccessful in obtaining permits, licenses, or other authorizations required to operate our business, such as for the marketing or sale or import or export of our products and services.\nWhile we endeavor to implement policies, procedures, and systems designed to achieve compliance with these regulatory requirements, we cannot assure you that these policies, procedures, or systems will be adequate or that we or our personnel will not violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations may harm our reputation and deter government agencies and other existing or potential customers or partners from purchasing our solutions. Furthermore, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, restrictions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nRegulatory requirements, such as laws requiring telecommunications providers to facilitate the monitoring of communications by law enforcement or governing the purchase and use of security solutions like ours, may also influence market demand for many of our products and/or customer requirements for specific functionality and performance or technical standards. The domestic and international regulatory environment is subject to constant change, often based on factors beyond our control or anticipation, including political climate, budgets, and current events, which could reduce demand for our products or require us to change or redesign products to maintain compliance or competitiveness.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on information security and data privacy issues and expanding laws in these areas may result in increased compliance costs, impact our business models, and expose us to increased liability.\nAs a global company, Verint is subject to global privacy and data security laws, and regulations. These laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in additional compliance obligations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Globally, new and emerging laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in Europe, state laws in the U.S. on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes create new compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. While we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirements, these new and emerging laws, regulations and codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models effectively. These new laws may also impact our products and services as well as our innovation in new and emerging technologies. These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts or otherwise increase our exposure to customers, regulators, or other third parties.\nTransferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for data transfers may be contested or invalidated. If the mechanisms for transferring personal information from certain countries or areas, including Europe to the United States, should be found invalid or if other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers (or not permit data to leave the country of origin), such developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation / Product Security and Intellectual Property\nThe mishandling or the perceived mishandling of sensitive information could harm our business.\nSome of our products are used by customers to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information and data, including information or data used in intelligence gathering or law enforcement activities as well as personally identifiable information. While our customers\u2019 use of our products does not provide us access to the customer\u2019s sensitive or confidential information or data (or the information or data our customers may collect), we or our partners may receive or come into contact with such information or data, including personally identifiable information, when we are asked to perform services or support functions for our customers. We or our partners may also receive or come into contact with such information or data in connection with our SaaS or other hosted or managed services offerings. Customers are also increasingly focused on the security of our products and services and we continuously work to address these concerns, including through the use of encryption, access rights, and other customary security features, which vary based on the solution in question and customer requirements. We expect to receive, come into contact with, or become custodian of an increasing amount of customer data (including end customer data) as our cloud business and cloud operations expand, increasing our exposure if we or one of our hosting partners experiences an issue relating to the security or the proper handling of that information. We have implemented policies and procedures, and use information technology systems, to help ensure the proper handling of such information and data, including background screening of certain services personnel, non-disclosure agreements with employees and partners, access rules, and controls on our information technology systems. We also evaluate the information security of potential\npartners and vendors as part of our selection process and attempt to negotiate adequate protections from such third parties in our contracts. However, these policies, procedures, systems, and measures are designed to mitigate the risks associated with handling or processing sensitive data and cannot safeguard against all risks at all times. The improper handling of sensitive data, or even the perception of such mishandling (whether or not valid), or other security lapses or breaches affecting us, our partners, or our products or services, could reduce demand for our products or services or otherwise expose us to financial or reputational harm or legal liability.\nOur solutions may contain defects or may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which could expose us to both financial and non-financial damages.\nOur solutions may contain defects or may develop operational problems. This risk is amplified for our more sophisticated solutions. New products and new product versions, service models such as hosting, SaaS, and managed services, and the incorporation of third-party products or services into our solutions, also give rise to the risk of defects or errors. These defects or errors may relate to the operation or the security of our products or services, including third party components or services such as hosting. If we do not discover and remedy such defects, errors, or other operational or security problems until after a product has been released to customers or partners, we may incur significant costs to correct such problems and/or become liable for substantial damages for product liability claims or other liabilities.\nOur solutions, including our cloud offerings, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks even if they do not contain defects. If there is a successful cyber-attack on one of our products or services, even absent a defect or error, it may also result in questions regarding the integrity of our products or services generally, which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance and could have a material adverse effect on our results or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to information technology system breaches, failures, or disruptions that could harm our operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate and manage our business and to process, maintain, and safeguard information, including information belonging to our customers, partners, and personnel. This information may be processed and maintained on our internal information technology systems or on systems hosted by third-party service providers. These systems, whether internal or external, may be subject to breaches, failures, or disruptions as a result of, among other things, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical security breaches, natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, new system implementations, or acts of terrorism or war. We have experienced cyber-attacks in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future, potentially with greater frequency. While we are continually working to maintain secure and reliable systems, our security, redundancy, and business continuity efforts may be ineffective or inadequate. We must continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite our efforts, it is possible that our security systems, controls, and other procedures that we follow or those employed by our third-party service providers, may not prevent breaches, failures, or disruptions. Such breaches, failures, or disruptions could subject us to the loss, compromise, destruction, or disclosure of sensitive or confidential information or intellectual property, either of our own information or IP or that of our customers (including end customers) or other third parties that may have been in our custody or in the custody of our third-party service providers, financial losses from remedial actions, litigation, regulatory issues, liabilities to customers or other third parties, damage to our reputation, delays in our ability to process orders, delays in our ability to provide products and services to customers, including SaaS or other hosted or managed services offerings, R&D or production downtimes, or delays or errors in financial reporting. Information system breaches or failures at one of our partners, including hosting providers or those who support other cloud-based offerings, may also result in similar adverse consequences. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur intellectual property may not be adequately protected.\nWhile much of our intellectual property is protected by patents or patent applications, we have not and cannot protect all of our intellectual property with patents or other registrations. There can be no assurance that patents we have applied for will be issued on the basis of our patent applications or that, if such patents are issued, they will be, or that our existing patents are, sufficiently broad enough to protect our technologies, products, or services. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, designed around, or challenged.\nIn order to safeguard our unpatented proprietary know-how, source code, trade secrets, and technology, we rely primarily upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and other third parties having access to our confidential information. There can be no assurance that these measures will adequately protect us from improper disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information.\nPreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is difficult even in jurisdictions with well-established legal protections for intellectual property such as the United States. It may be even more difficult to protect our intellectual property in other jurisdictions where legal protections for intellectual property rights are less established. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party use or infringement, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe or may be alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions for us and may require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for any damages they suffer.\nThe technology industry is characterized by frequent allegations of intellectual property infringement. In the past, third parties have asserted that certain of our products infringed on their intellectual property rights and similar claims may be made in the future. Any allegation of infringement against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve, result in substantial diversion of management resources, cause product shipment delays, or force us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If patent holders or other holders of intellectual property initiate legal proceedings against us, either with respect to our own intellectual property or intellectual property we license from third parties, we may be forced into protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. We may not be successful in defending such litigation, in part due to the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation, and may not be able to procure any required royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers or partners. Subject to certain limitations, we generally indemnify our customers and partners with respect to infringement by our products on the proprietary rights of third parties, which, in some cases, may not be limited to a specified maximum amount and for which we may not have sufficient insurance coverage or adequate indemnification in the case of intellectual property licensed from a third party. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages, be required to obtain licenses for the products our customers or partners use or sell, or incur significant expenses in developing non-infringing alternatives. If we cannot obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using or, in the case of resellers and other partners, stop selling our products.\nUse of free or open source software could expose our products to unintended restrictions and could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of our products contain free or open source software (together, \u201copen source software\u201d) and we anticipate making use of open source software in the future. Open source software is generally covered by license agreements that permit the user to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software without cost, provided that the users and modifiers abide by certain licensing requirements. The original developers of the open source software generally provide no warranties on such software or protections in the event the open source software infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Although we endeavor to monitor the use of open source software in our product development, we cannot assure you that past, present, or future products, including products inherited in acquisitions, will not contain open source software elements that impose unfavorable licensing restrictions or other requirements on our products, including the need to seek licenses from third parties, to re-engineer affected products, to discontinue sales of affected products, or to release all or portions of the source code of affected products. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Structure\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which exposes us to leverage risks and subjects us to covenants which may adversely affect our operations.\nAt March 15, 2019, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $817.6 million under our 2017 Credit Agreement and our 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), meaning that we are significantly leveraged. In addition, we have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our 2017 Credit Agreement, including the revolving credit facility, for a variety of purposes, including, among others, acquisitions and stock repurchases. Our leverage position may, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to repatriate cash for debt service from our foreign subsidiaries resulting in dividend tax costs or require us to adopt other disadvantageous tax structures to accommodate debt service payments; or\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns, limit our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities, and restrict our flexibility to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nIn addition, because our indebtedness under our 2017 Credit Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates. Interest rates on loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement are periodically reset, at our option, at either a Eurodollar Rate or an ABR rate (each as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement), plus in each case a margin. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, and we have approached the administrative agent under this facility to discuss the impact of the planned phase out. However, it is currently uncertain what, if any. alternative reference interest rates or other reforms will be enacted in response to the planned phase out, and we cannot assure you that an alternative to LIBOR (on which the Eurodollar Rate is based) that we find acceptable will be available to us.\nThe revolving credit facility under our 2017 Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to satisfy a maximum consolidated leverage ratio test. Our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate sufficient earnings each quarter, or in the alternative, to reduce expenses and/or reduce the level of our outstanding debt, and we cannot assure that we will be successful in any or all of these regards.\nOur 2017 Credit Agreement also includes a number of restrictive covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or liens or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nchange our lines of business;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans, or advances; and\n\u2022\nengage in consolidations, mergers, liquidations, or dissolutions.\nThese covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, to meet our capital needs, or to otherwise engage in transactions that might be considered beneficial to us.\nIf certain events of default occur under our 2017 Credit Agreement, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. An acceleration of indebtedness under our 2017 Credit Agreement may also result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes. Additionally, if a change of control as defined in our 2017 Credit Agreement were to occur, the lenders under our credit facilities would have the right to require us to repay all of our outstanding obligations under the facilities.\nIf a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the Notes were to occur, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes during specified periods of time at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we may be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIf any of the events described in the foregoing paragraphs were to occur, in order to satisfy our obligations we may be forced to seek an amendment of and/or waiver under our debt agreements, raise additional capital through securities offerings, asset sales, or other transactions, or seek to refinance or restructure our debt. In such a case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate such a transaction on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe consider other financing and refinancing options from time to time, however, we cannot assure you that such options will\nbe available to us on reasonable terms or at all. If one or more rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings, that could also impede our ability to refinance our existing debt or secure new debt, increase our future cost of borrowing, and create third-party concerns about our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations, strategic opportunities, and to service our debt, we may incur withholding taxes in order to repatriate certain overseas cash balances, or we may need to raise additional capital in the future.\nOn December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) was enacted in the United States. The 2017 Tax Act included significant changes to corporate taxation in the United States including a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result, all deferred foreign earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax have now been taxed and we therefore do not expect to incur any significant additional U.S. taxes related to such amounts. However, certain unremitted earnings may be subject to foreign withholding tax upon repatriation to the United States.\nIf the cash generated by our domestic operations, plus certain foreign cash which we would repatriate and for which we have accrued the related withholding tax, is not sufficient to fund our domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, and to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to obtain new credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate additional overseas cash. Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership. Furthermore, lenders may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to repatriate foreign cash and incur a significant tax cost (in addition to amounts previously accrued) or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop new products, respond to competitive pressures, repurchase outstanding stock or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be adversely affected by our acquisition of CTI or our historical affiliation with CTI and its former subsidiaries.\nAs a result of the February 2013 acquisition of our former parent company, CTI (the \u201cCTI Merger\u201d), CTI\u2019s liabilities, including contingent liabilities, have been consolidated into our financial statements. If CTI\u2019s liabilities are greater than represented, if the contingent liabilities we have assumed become fixed, or if there are obligations of CTI of which we were not aware at the time of completion of the CTI Merger, we may have exposure for those obligations and our business or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Adjustments to the CTI consolidated group\u2019s tax liability for periods prior to the CTI Merger could also affect the net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) allocated to Verint as a result of the CTI Merger and cause us to incur additional tax liability in future periods. In addition, adjustments to the historical CTI consolidated group\u2019s tax liability for periods prior to Verint\u2019s IPO could affect the NOLs allocated to Verint in the IPO and cause us to incur additional tax liability in future periods.\nWe are entitled to certain indemnification rights from the successor to CTI\u2019s business operations (Mavenir Inc.) under the agreements entered into in connection with the distribution by CTI to its shareholders of substantially all of its assets other than its interest in us (the \u201cComverse Share Distribution\u201d) prior to the CTI Merger. However, there is no assurance that Mavenir will be willing and able to provide such indemnification if needed. If we become responsible for liabilities not covered by indemnification or substantially in excess of amounts covered by indemnification, or if Mavenir becomes unwilling or unable to stand behind such protections, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial results may be significantly impacted by changes in our tax position.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (including our NOL carryforwards), changes in unrecognized tax benefits, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States, may from time to time review the pricing arrangements between us and our foreign subsidiaries or among our foreign subsidiaries. An adverse determination by one or more tax authorities in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets which can provide us with significant future cash tax savings if we are able to use them, including significant NOLs inherited as a result of the CTI Merger. However, the extent to which we will be able to use these NOLs may be impacted, restricted, or eliminated by a number of factors, including changes in tax rates, laws or regulations,\nwhether we generate sufficient future taxable income, and possible adjustments to the tax attributes of CTI or its non-Verint subsidiaries for periods prior to the CTI Merger. To the extent that we are unable to utilize our NOLs or other losses, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. When we cease to have NOLs available to us in a particular tax jurisdiction, either through their expiration, disallowance, or utilization, our cash tax liability will increase in that jurisdiction.\nIn addition, on December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted in the United States. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and it includes fundamental changes to taxation of U.S. multinational corporations. Compliance with the 2017 Tax Act requires significant complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law.\nThe key provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, which may significantly impact our current and future effective tax rates, include new limitations on the tax deductions for interest expense and executive compensation, elimination of the alternative minimum tax (\u201cAMT\u201d) and the ability to refund unused AMT credits over a four-year period, and new rules related to uses and limitations of NOL carryforwards. New international provisions add a new category of deemed income from our foreign operations, eliminate U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain restrictions), and add a minimum tax on certain payments made to foreign related parties.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could adversely impact our financial condition or operating results.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and other organizations that develop and interpret accounting principles. New accounting principles arise regularly, implementation of which can have a significant effect on and may increase the volatility of our reported operating results and may even retroactively affect previously reported operating results. In addition, the implementation of new accounting principles may require significant changes to our customer and vendor contracts, business processes, accounting systems, and internal controls over financial reporting. The costs and effects of these changes could adversely impact our operating results, and difficulties in implementing new accounting principles could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent misstatements and material weaknesses or deficiencies could arise in the future which could lead to restatements or filing delays.\nOur system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement. An evaluation of effectiveness is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures decreases over time, or because of unanticipated circumstances or other factors. As a result, although our management has concluded that our internal controls are effective as of January 31, 2019, we cannot assure you that our internal controls will prevent or detect every misstatement, that material weaknesses or other deficiencies will not occur or be identified in the future, that this or future financial reports will not contain material misstatements or omissions, that future restatements will not be required, or that we will be able to timely comply with our reporting obligations in the future.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nBecause we have historically acquired a significant number of companies, goodwill and other intangible assets have represented a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.6 billion, or approximately 57% of our total assets, as of January 31, 2019. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment, and we assess on an as-needed basis whether there have been impairments in our other intangible assets. We make assumptions and estimates in this assessment which are complex and often subjective. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. To the extent that the factors described above change, we could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to currency exchange risk.\nWe earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets, and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Israeli shekel, euro, British pound sterling, Singapore dollar, Brazilian real, and Australia dollar, among others. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of entities using non-U.S. dollar functional currencies into U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period, meaning that we are exposed to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, our net income is impacted by the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an entity\u2019s functional currency, gains or losses on which are recorded within other income (expense), net. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. However, our hedging activities are limited in scope and duration and may not be effective at reducing the U.S. dollar cost of our global operations.\nIn addition, our financial outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates subsequent to providing our financial outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks, which could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nThe prices of our common stock and the Notes have been, and may continue to be, volatile and your investment could lose value.\nThe prices of our common stock and the Notes have been, and may continue to be, volatile. Those prices could be affected by any of the risk factors discussed in this Item. In addition, other factors that could impact the prices of our common stock and/or the Notes include:\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors regarding, among other things, strategic changes, new products, product enhancements or technological advances, acquisitions, major transactions, significant litigation or regulatory matters, stock repurchases, or management changes;\n\u2022\npress or analyst publications, including with respect to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates or growth rates by financial analysts, changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our securities, our credit ratings, our security solutions and customers, speculation regarding strategy or M&A, or market trends unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nstock sales by our directors, officers, or other significant holders, or stock repurchases by us;\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity by third parties, including by the counterparties to the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes; and\n\u2022\ndilution that may occur upon any conversion of the Notes.\nA significant drop in the price of our common stock or the Notes could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 89397, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "VRNT"}
