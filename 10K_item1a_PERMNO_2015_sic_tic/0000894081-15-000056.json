{"cik": "894081", "company": "Air Transport Services Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The risks below are not the only risks that the Company faces. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider immaterial or unlikely could also adversely affect the Company.\nThe economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the globe may negatively impact the demand for the Company\u2019s aircraft and services.\nAir cargo transportation volumes are strongly correlated to general economic conditions, including the price of aviation fuel. An economic downturn could reduce the demand for delivery services offered by DHL and other delivery businesses, in particular expedited services shipped via aircraft. Further, during an economic slowdown, customers generally prefer to use ground-based or marine delivery services instead of more expensive air delivery services. Accordingly, an economic downturn could reduce the demand for airlift and cargo aircraft leases. Additionally, if the price of aviation fuel rises significantly, the demand for cargo aircraft and air delivery services may decline. During periods of downward economic trends and rising fuel costs, freight forwarders and integrated delivery businesses are more likely to defer market expansion plans. As a result, we may experience delays in the deployment of available aircraft with customers under lease, ACMI or charter arrangements.\nThe recent agreement executed with DHL may impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition differently than historical results.\nIn January 2015, the Company and DHL amended and restated the CMI agreement that would otherwise expire in March 2015. The restated CMI agreement, which will be effective April 1, 2015, contains provisions that will effect future operating results differently than the previous CMI agreement. Under the restated CMI agreement, the cost of Boeing 767 airframe maintenance is included in the pre-defined price for services that ABX charges to DHL. Currently, DHL is directly responsible for the costs of airframe maintenance of leased aircraft. Similarly, ABX may be required, under the restated CMI agreement, to pay certain costs associated with engine maintenance events, currently paid or reimbursed by DHL. Further, under the new agreement, the aircraft rental rates for 13 Boeing 767 aircraft were reduced, effective April 1, 2015, while the term of the respective leases was extended through March of 2019.\nOur costs incurred in providing airline services could be more than the contractual revenues generated.\nEach airline develops business proposals for ACMI, charter, DHL and other operating contracts by projecting operating costs, crew productivity and maintenance expenses. Projections contain key assumptions, including maintenance costs, flight hours, aircraft reliability, crewmember productivity and crewmember compensation and benefits. We may overestimate revenues, the level of crewmember productivity, and/or underestimate the actual costs of providing services when preparing business proposals. If actual costs are higher than projected or aircraft reliability is less than expected, future operating results may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s airlines rely on flight crews that are unionized. If collective bargaining agreements increase our costs and we cannot recover such increases, it may be necessary for us to terminate customer contracts or curtail planned growth. If disagreements arise, airline operations could be interrupted and business could be adversely affected until agreements are reached with the crewmembers.\nThe rate of aircraft deployments may impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition will depend in part on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to successfully deploy aircraft in operations that provide a positive return on investment. Our success will depend, in part, on their ability to secure additional cargo volumes from customers, in both U.S. and international markets. Deploying aircraft in international markets can pose additional risks, regulatory requirements and costs.\nThe actual demand for Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft may be less than we anticipate. The actual lease rates for aircraft available for lease may be less than we projected, or new leases may start later than we expect. Further, other airlines and lessors may be willing to offer aircraft to the market under terms more favorable to lessees.\nOur airline operating agreements include on-time reliability requirements which can impact the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our airline operating agreements contain monthly incentive payments for reaching specific on-time reliability thresholds. Additionally, such airline operating agreements contain monetary penalties for aircraft reliability below certain thresholds. As a result, our operating revenues may vary from period to period depending on the achievement of monthly incentives or the imposition of penalties. Further, an airline could be found in default of an agreement if it does not maintain minimum thresholds over an extended period of time.\nIf ABX fails to maintain aircraft reliability above a minimum threshold under the restated CMI agreement for two consecutive calendar months or three months in a rolling twelve month period, ABX would be in default of the restated CMI agreement with DHL. In that event, DHL may elect to terminate the restated CMI agreement, unless ABX maintains the minimum reliability threshold during a 60-day cure period. If DHL terminates the CMI agreement due to an ABX event of default, ABX would be subject to a monetary penalty payable to DHL. The monetary penalty starts at $12 million through the first contract year, and amortizes to $3 million during the next two contract years of the restated CMI agreement.\nUnder provisions of the restated CMI and lease agreements with DHL, DHL can terminate the restated CMI or lease agreements subject to early termination provisions.\nDHL may terminate one or more of the aircraft from the restated CMI agreement for convenience at any time during the four year term (through March 31, 2019), subject to providing a 60 day notice period and paying to ABX a termination fee for certain aircraft. DHL may terminate the restated CMI agreement in its entirety after providing 180\ndays of advance notice after the first six months of the term and paying a significant termination fee which amortizes down during the term.\nThe lease agreements with DHL contain terms for terminating an aircraft lease for convenience, including a notice period and paying a lump sum amount to CAM. DHL may terminate one or more of the respective 13 aircraft leases for convenience through the original expiration date, upon providing six months' notice and paying to CAM a lump sum amount and, further, may thereafter terminate one or more of such aircraft leases for convenience upon providing four months\u2019 notice and paying to CAM a lump sum amount. Additional Boeing 767 aircraft that DHL is committed to lease from CAM may be terminated upon providing four months' notice and paying to CAM a lump sum amount.\nThe U.S. Military may not renew our contracts or may reduce the number of routes that we operate.\nOur contracts with the U.S. Military are typically for one year and are not required to be renewed. The U.S. Military may terminate the contracts for convenience or in the event we were to fail to satisfy reliability requirements or for other reasons. The number and frequency of routes is sensitive to changes in military priorities and U.S. defense budgets.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by adverse audit findings by the U.S. Government.\nOur U.S. Military contracts are subject to audit by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If an audit uncovers improprieties, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including termination of such contracts, forfeiture of profits, fines and suspension from doing business with the U.S. Military.\nOur USPS operations may be negatively impacted by U.S. Government regulations and contract expirations.\nThe contracts for the five facilities we operate for the USPS have been extended from their original expiration dates in 2014 and are currently scheduled to expire during 2015. We understand that the USPS is evaluating contract renewals and internal alternatives for these five facilities. The contracts for some or all of these facilities may not be renewed.\nAs a result of the Affordable Care Act, some of the Company's employees that perform services in support of the USPS operations may qualify for additional employee benefits which could increase our costs. In such event, the Company may seek contractual amendments with the USPS for additional compensation. However such compensation may not occur, could be delayed or may not be sufficient to cover our incremental costs.\nProposed rules from the DOT, FAA and TSA could increase the Company's operating costs and reduce customer utilization of airfreight.\nNew FAA rules for Flightcrew Member Duty and Rest Requirements (FMDRR) for passenger airline operations became effective in January 2014. The new rules apply to our operation of combi aircraft for the U.S military and impact the required amount and timing of rest periods for pilots between work assignments and modified duty and rest requirements based on the time of day, number of scheduled segments, flight types, time zones and other factors. Failure to remain in compliance with these rules may subject us to fines or other enforcement action.\nIf applied to cargo carriers, the new rules would require a pilot to have the opportunity to rest for nine hours before reporting to flight duty and place other restrictions on the number of duty hours in particular time periods. In May 2012, the FAA indicated that it would reconsider its initial decision to exclude cargo pilots from these new requirements. While not currently required for the Company's cargo operations, if such rest requirements and restrictions were imposed on our cargo operations, these rules could have a significant impact on the costs incurred by our airlines. The airlines would attempt to pass such additional costs through to their customers in the form of price increases. Customers, as a result, may seek to reduce their utilization of aircraft in favor of less expensive transportation alternatives.\nThe concentration of aircraft types and engines in the Company's airlines could adversely affect our operating and financial results.\nThe combined aircraft fleet is concentrated in two aircraft types. If any of these aircraft types encounter technical difficulties that resulted in significant FAA airworthiness directives or grounding, our ability to lease the aircraft would be adversely impacted, as would our airlines' operations. The market growth in demand for the Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft types and configurations may be less than we anticipate. Customers may develop preferences for the Airbus A300-600 and A330 aircraft or other mid-size aircraft types, instead of the Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft.\nThe cost of aircraft repairs and unexpected delays in the time required to complete aircraft maintenance could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur aircraft provide ACMI services throughout the world, sometimes operating in remote regions. Our aircraft may experience maintenance events in locations that do not have the necessary repair capabilities or are difficult to reach. As a result, we may incur additional expenses and lose billable revenues that we would have otherwise earned. Under the restated CMI agreement with DHL, we are required to provide a spare aircraft while the scheduled maintenance is completed. We are likewise required to provide a spare aircraft under the restated CMI agreement while the Boeing 767 aircraft that DHL leases from CAM are undergoing scheduled maintenance. If delays occur in the completion of aircraft maintenance, we may incur additional expense to provide airlift capacity and forego revenues.\nWe rely on third parties to modify aircraft and provide aircraft and engine maintenance.\nWe rely on certain third party aircraft modification service providers and aircraft and engine maintenance service providers that have expertise or resources that we do not have. Third party service providers may seek to impose price increases that could negatively affect our competitiveness in the airline markets. An unexpected termination or delay involving service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. A delay in an aircraft modification could adversely impact our revenues and our ability to place the aircraft in the market. We must manage third party service providers to meet schedules and turn-times and to control costs in order to remain competitive to our customers.\nDelta TechOps, a division of Delta Airlines, Inc., is the primary engine maintenance provider for the Company's General Electric CF6 engines that power our fleet of Boeing 767-200 aircraft. If Delta TechOps does not complete the refurbishment of our engines within the contractual turn-times or if we must replace Delta TechOps as the maintenance provider for some or all of the Company's CF6 engines, our operations and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company's operating results could be negatively impacted by disruptions of its information technology and communication systems.\nOur businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyberattacks, natural disasters, power failures, telecommunication outages, or other causes. Certain disruptions could prevent our airlines from flying as scheduled, possibly for an extended period of time, which could have a negative impact on our operating results and reliability. We continually monitor the risks of disruption, take preventative measures, develop backup plans and maintain redundancy capabilities. The measures we use may not prevent the causes of disruptions we could experience or help us recover failed systems quickly.\nThe costs of maintaining preventive maintenance measures may continue to rise. Further, the costs of recovering or replacing a failed system could be very expensive.\nThe costs of our aircraft maintenance facilities could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe lease and operate a 310,000 square foot aircraft maintenance facility and a 100,000 square foot component repair shop in Wilmington, Ohio. Accordingly, a large portion of our MRO's operating costs are fixed. As a result, we need to retain existing aircraft maintenance business levels while securing additional customers to maintain a profitable operation. The actual level of revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs.\nThe Company could violate debt covenants.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains covenants including, among other requirements, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and guarantees of indebtedness. The Senior Credit Agreement is collateralized by certain of the Company's Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft that are not collateralized under aircraft loans. Under the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain aircraft collateral coverage equal to 150% of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the maximum capacity of the revolving credit facility or 175% of the outstanding balance of the term loan and the total funded revolving credit facility, whichever is less. The Senior Credit Agreement stipulates events of default, including unspecified events that may have material adverse effects on the Company. The Senior Credit Agreement and aircraft loans cross default. If an event of default occurs, the Company may be forced to repay, renegotiate or replace the Senior Credit Agreement and loans. In such an event, the Company\u2019s cost of borrowings could increase, and our ability to modify and deploy aircraft could be limited as a result.\nThe Company's share buy-back plan may reduce liquidity.\nDuring 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan to buy up to $50 million of ATSG 's common stock. While no shares were purchased during 2014, future purchases, if any, would be funded from the Company's cash balances and could reduce the Company's liquidity.\nThe Company's existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient if opportunities to expand the aircraft fleet or make strategic investment in other companies arise.\nWhile we have planned for minimal aircraft acquisitions for 2015, opportunities to grow revenues could arise that require more aircraft, an aircraft type that we do not currently have, or other strategic investments. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's liquidity included $30.6 million of cash balances and $86.0 million available under the revolving credit facility through the Senior Credit Agreement and with the creditors consent, $50 million through an accordion feature of the Senior Credit Agreement. The existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to support further fleet expansion or other strategic investments. Raising additional sources of credit could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and additional covenant requirements.\nOperating results may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates.\nEffective March 31, 2011, in conjunction with our decision to refinance the unsubordinated term loan, we ceased hedge accounting for certain interest rate swaps which we continue to hold. In addition to these interest rate swaps, the Company's Senior Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain derivative instruments for fluctuating interest rates for at least 50% of the outstanding balance of the new unsubordinated term loan. Accordingly, in July 2011, the Company entered into new derivative instruments. Also, in June 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a forward start date of December 31, 2013. We did not designate the derivative instruments as hedges. Future fluctuations in LIBOR interest rates will result in the recording of gains and losses on interest rate derivatives that the Company holds.\nUnder the Senior Credit Agreement, interest rates are adjusted quarterly based on the prevailing LIBOR or prime rates and a ratio of the Company's outstanding debt level to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (\"EBITDA\"). At the Company's current debt-to-EBITDA ratio, the unsubordinated term loan and the revolving credit facility both bear a variable interest rate of 2.17%. Additional debt or lower EBITDA may result in higher interest rates on the variable rate portion of the Company's debt.\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement healthcare plans for certain eligible employees. The Company's related pension expense and funding requirements are sensitive to changes in interest rates used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned by participants in the plans. The annual pension expense is recalculated at the beginning of each calendar year using market interest rates at that point in time. Future fluctuations in interest rates could result in the recording of additional expense for pension and other post-retirement healthcare plans.\nThe costs of insurance coverage or changes to our reserves for self-insured claims could affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company is self-insured for certain claims related to workers\u2019 compensation, aircraft, automobile, general liability and employee healthcare. We record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported. Accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data and recent claims trends. Changes in claim severity and frequency could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be further limited.\nLimitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nChanges in the ownership of the Company on the part of significant shareholders could limit our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its\npre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of significant stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nWe may need to reduce the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThe Company owns a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and related equipment. Additionally, the balance sheet reflects assets for income tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The removal of aircraft from service or continual losses from aircraft operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those aircraft, related parts and equipment and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airlines were to lose its authority to operate, it could be necessary to record an impairment charge.\nIf the Company incurs operating losses or our estimates of expected future earnings indicate a decline, it may be necessary to reassess the need for a valuation allowance for some or all of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets.\nPenalties, fines and sanctions levied by governmental agencies or the costs of complying with government regulations could negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to complex aviation, transportation, security, environmental, labor, employment and other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally require our subsidiaries to maintain and comply with a wide variety of certificates, permits, licenses and other approvals. Their inability to maintain required certificates, permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or, in the case of DOT and FAA requirements, possible suspension or revocation of their authority to conduct operations.\nThe costs of maintaining our aircraft in compliance with government regulations could negatively affect our results of operations and require further investment in our aircraft fleet.\nAll aircraft in the Company\u2019s fleet were manufactured prior to 1995. Manufacturer Service Bulletins and FAA regulations and FAA airworthiness directives issued under its \u201cAging Aircraft\u201d program cause operators of such aged aircraft to be subject to additional inspections and modifications to address problems of corrosion and structural fatigue at specified times. The FAA may issue airworthiness directives that could require significant inspections and major modifications to such aircraft. The FAA may issue airworthiness directives that could limit the usability of certain aircraft types. In 2012, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive that requires the replacement of the aft pressure bulkhead on Boeing 767-200 aircraft based on a certain number of landing cycles. As a result, we expect that 24 of the Company's Boeing 767-200 aircraft will be affected. The cost of compliance is estimated to be $1.0 million per aircraft over the next ten years.\nIn addition, FAA regulations require that aircraft manufacturers establish limits on aircraft flight cycles to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft, as described in Item 1 of this report, under \"Federal Aviation Administration.\" These regulations may increase our maintenance costs and eventually limit the use of our aircraft.\nThe FAA and ICAO are in the process of developing programs to modernize air traffic control and management systems. The FAA's program, Next Generation Air Transportation Systems, is an integrated system that requires updating aircraft navigation and communication equipment. The FAA has mandated the replacement of current ground based radar systems with more accurate satellite based systems on our aircraft by 2020. The ICAO is phasing in similar requirements for aircraft operating in Europe, beginning in 2015. These programs may increase our costs and limit the use of our aircraft. Aircraft not equipped with advanced communication systems may be restricted to certain airspace.\nFailure to maintain the operating certificates and authorities of our airlines would adversely affect our business.\nThe airline subsidiaries have the necessary authority to conduct flight operations pursuant to the economic authority issued by the DOT and the safety based authority issued by the FAA. The continued effectiveness of such authority is subject to their compliance with applicable statutes and DOT, FAA and TSA rules and regulations, including any new rules and regulations that may be adopted in the future. The loss of such authority by an airline subsidiary could cause\na default of covenants within the Senior Credit Agreement and would materially and adversely affect its airline operations, effectively eliminating the airline's ability to operate air services.\nThe Company may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such potential climate change.\nThe Company is subject to the regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments regarding air quality and other matters. In part, because of the highly industrialized nature of many of the locations where the Company operates, there can be no assurance that we have discovered all environmental contamination or other matters for which the Company may be responsible.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant federal, state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The European Commission has mandated the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (\"ETS\") for greenhouse gas emissions to the airline industry. Under the European Union ETS, all ABX and ATI flights that are wholly within the European Union are now covered by the ETS requirements, and each year we are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. Exceedance of the airlines' emission allowances would require the airlines to purchase additional emission allowances on the open market. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is also expected to consider mechanisms for reducing greenhouse gas emissions related to aviation.\nThe U.S. Congress and certain states have also considered legislation regulating greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, even in the absence of such legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could regulate greenhouse gas emissions, especially aircraft engine emissions. The cost to comply with potential new laws and regulations could be substantial for the Company. These costs could include an increase in the cost of the fuel and capital costs associated with updating aircraft. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on the Company\u2019s cost structure or operating results. Further, even without such legislation or regulation, increased awareness and adverse publicity in the global marketplace about greenhouse gas emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services.", "PERMNO": 90716, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "ATSG"}
