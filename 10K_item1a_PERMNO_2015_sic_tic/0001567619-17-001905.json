{"cik": "1388133", "company": "ShoreTel Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not be able to complete our merger with Mitel and uncertainty concerning completion of the merger may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nThe closing of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to satisfy or obtain a waiver of the other conditions to completion of the merger, in which case the merger may not be completed.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business and relationships may be adversely affected and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by the Company or Mitel under certain circumstances. The restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the merger, and the uncertainties and risks concerning completion of the merger, may cause our business, sales, operations and financial results to suffer during the executory period or in the event the merger is not completed. The merger agreement requires us to conduct business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Merger Agreement, we might have pursued. The announcement of the merger and any delay in completing the merger may divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations, affect our ability to retain or recruit key employees and negatively impact our business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, the nature, cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the merger and instituted against us and others, may be material.\nWe may not be able to achieve our strategic initiatives and grow our business as anticipated.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful over the long term in transitioning internal and external views of our company to a software-based service delivery model and growing our business as anticipated. Our strategic initiatives have required us to devote significant financial and operational assets to these activities. However, at the same time, a growing focus on hosted revenues involves different types of revenue recognition and has different cost structures than our traditional product revenues. Our success depends on our ability to appropriately manage our expenses as we invest in these initiatives, enter into beneficial channel relationships, develop new solutions and successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies. If we are not able to execute on this strategy successfully or if our investments in these activities do not yield significant returns, our business may not grow as we anticipated, we could devote significant financial and other resources to developing solutions that never reach commercial success, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if the UC industry transitions in a way we did not anticipate, we may not be able to shift our strategies and products rapidly enough to respond to such changes and we may not receive any return from such investments. Our competitors may also be developing new products to address transitions in the UC industry. If we are unable to successfully establish our new solutions, if our competitors\u2019 products and services are better received, or if we fail to execute our strategies, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business may be impacted.\nThe market in which we operate is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors are larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.\nThe industry for Unified Communications is extremely competitive. Our competitors include 8x8, Avaya, Broadsoft, Cisco, Microsoft, Mitel, RingCentral, Vonage and Fuze. In addition, many of our hosted customers are not subject to long-term contractual commitments to purchase our services and can terminate our service and switch to competitors' offerings on relatively short notice.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources. We could also face competition from new entrants, whether from new ventures or from established companies moving in to the industry. Some competitors have advantages over us, including:\n\u2022 greater market presence, name recognition and brand reputation;\n\u2022 larger distribution channels;\n\u2022 a larger installed base of telecommunications and networking systems with customers;\n\u2022 larger and more geographically distributed services and support organizations and capabilities;\n\u2022 a broader offering of telecommunications and networking products, applications and services;\n\u2022 a more established international presence to address the needs of global enterprises;\n\u2022 larger patent and intellectual property portfolios;\n\u2022 longer operating histories;\n\u2022 a longer history of implementing large-scale telecommunications or networking systems;\n\u2022 more established relationships with industry participants, customers, suppliers, distributors and other technology companies;\n\u2022 the ability to acquire technologies or consolidate with other companies in the industry to compete more effectively; and\n\u2022 the ability to bundle a broader offering of telecom and networking equipment and services into an IP PBX offering, and offer these products as part of a hosted services offering.\nGiven their capital resources, many of these competitors are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by enterprise customers on telecommunications equipment and are not as susceptible to downturns in a particular industry. This risk is enhanced because we focus our business primarily on the enterprise IP telecommunications industry.\nBecause some of our competitors have greater financial strength than we do and are able to offer a more diversified bundle of products and services, they have offered, and in the future may offer telecommunications products at lower prices than we do. In order to remain competitive from a cost perspective, we have in the past reduced the prices of our products, and we may be required to do so in the future, in order to gain enterprise customers. Price reductions could have a negative effect on our gross margins.\nOur competitors may also be able to devote more resources to developing new or enhanced products, including products that may be based on new technologies or standards. If our competitors\u2019 products become more accepted than our products, our competitive position will be impaired and we may not be able to increase our revenue or may experience decreased gross margins. If any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies become the industry standard, if they are successful in bringing their products to market earlier, or if their products are more technologically capable than ours, then our sales could be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business. Our competitors may also be able to expand their geographic presence faster than us allowing them to service larger customers and adversely affecting our business.\nAs voice, video, messaging and data networks converge, we are likely to face increased competition from companies in the information technology, personal and business applications and software industries.\nThe convergence of voice, video, messaging and data networks and their wider deployment by enterprises has led information technology and communication applications deployed on converged networks to become more integrated. This integration has created an opportunity for the leaders in information technology, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications, to enter the telecommunications industry and offer products that compete with our systems, commonly referred to as Unified Communications. Competition from these potential entrants may take many forms, and they may offer products and services similar to those we offer.\nIf the solutions offered by new competitors achieve substantial market penetration, or if we cannot integrate our products with such solutions, we may not be able to maintain or improve our market position, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe plan to further expand our operations to support the growth of our business. We will need to increase our spending in order to fund this development. This growth may place a significant strain on our management,\nadministrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend upon our ability to manage this growth effectively. If we do not increase our revenues commensurate to our increased spending, we may not be profitable. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty in filling customer orders, declines in product quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, production and distribution difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations.\nThe gross margins on our products and offerings may decrease due to competitive pressures or otherwise, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nIt is possible that the gross margins on our products and/or services will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures, including the bundling of more offerings included in a base price, new product introductions by us or our competitors, increases in data center costs, changes in the costs of components or telecommunications costs, manufacturing issues, the shift in our channel distribution model towards more value-added distributors, royalties we need to pay to use certain intellectual property, growth of our international business, or other factors. The margins on our hosted telephony service are also impacted by the fact that we also sell the broadband connection, which is typically a lower-margin business. In addition, until we achieve a sufficient base of cloud-based customers, the gross margins on our cloud services will tend to be lower. If we experience decreased gross margins and we are unable to respond in a timely manner by introducing and selling new, higher-margin solutions successfully and continually reducing our product and hosting costs, our gross margins may decline, which will harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards, our solutions could become obsolete or less competitive in the future.\nOur industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technologies and standards. Accordingly, our operating results depend upon, among other things, our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and our ability to reduce production costs of existing products and costs of providing our hosted services. Our long-term success will depend on our ability to stay ahead of these changes and avoid obsolescence of our solutions.\nIn addition, as industry standards evolve, it is possible that one standard becomes predominant in the market. This could facilitate the entry into the market for competing products and services, which could result in significant pricing pressure. Additionally, if one standard becomes predominant and we adopt that standard, enterprises may be able to create a unified, integrated system by using phones, switches, servers, applications, or other telecommunications products produced by different companies. Therefore, we may be unable to sell complete systems to enterprise customers because the enterprise customers elect to purchase portions of their telecommunications systems from our competitors.\nWe rely on third-party resellers and distributors to sell our solutions, and disruptions to, or our failure to develop and manage our distribution channels could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our hosted and product, support and services revenue is generated through indirect channel sales. These indirect sales channels include third-party resellers and distributors that market and sell other solutions to customers. We expect indirect channel sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Therefore, our success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with third-party resellers and distributors, and the financial health of these resellers and distributors.\nRecruiting, launching and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in our solutions requires significant time and resources. In order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to recruit larger and more productive channel partners. We must also scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel, including investment in personnel, systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.\nWe have no long-term contracts with any of our channel partners, and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential channel partners to favor their products or to prevent or\nreduce sales of our products. Our channel partners may choose not to offer our products or services exclusively or at all. Our failure to establish and maintain successful relationships with channel partners would likely materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we rely on these entities to provide many of the installation, implementation and support services for our products. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the effective performance of these channel partners. If a partner\u2019s performance is ineffective, it may reflect poorly upon ShoreTel or negatively impact our business. By relying on channel partners, we may in some cases have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our products, service ongoing enterprise customer requirements and respond to evolving enterprise customer needs. Additionally, some of our channel partners are smaller companies that may not have the same financial resources as other of our larger channel partners, which exposes us to collections risks.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, integrate and retain sales, technical and key personnel, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business.\nOur company strategy and future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, integrate and retain our sales, technical and key personnel, namely our management and executive team and experienced sales and engineering personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, particularly in many of the cities in which we operate. In addition, even if we succeed in hiring additional sales personnel, it may take some period of time before they become productive compounding any harm in the growth of our business from our inability to retain such sales personnel. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, and our management and key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain key employees, our ability to manage and grow our business could be harmed, particularly if the departure of any executive or key employee results in a business interruption, or if we are not successful in preserving material knowledge of our departing employees.\nThe impact of the current economic climate and possible adverse credit markets may impact customer demand for our products and services.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology. Many of our existing and target customers are in the small and medium business sector. Our target customers may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. Additionally, these customers often have limited discretionary funds which they may choose to spend on items other than our products and services. The purchase of our premise solution involves significant upfront expenditures. If credit is not available to them, it may be difficult or impossible for our resellers and/or end customers to purchase our premise products. If small and medium businesses experience economic hardship, this could negatively affect the overall demand for our products and services, delay and lengthen sales cycles and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenue.\nWe have made acquisitions in the past and may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies. Acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.\nThere are inherent risks in integrating and managing acquisitions. We may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, product lines and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following an acquisition. We may also incur indebtedness in connection with any future acquisitions. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022 incurrence of acquisition-related direct and indirect costs;\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022 risks related to entering into new markets;\n\u2022 harm to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022 the potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022 use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022 risks associated with unknown liabilities, including liabilities for sales, use, telecom, utility and other taxes;\n\u2022 use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition; and\n\u2022 risks and costs associated with financing the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of the other companies that we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process which could harm our results of operations. Also, any contingent consideration related to the acquisitions may be remeasured to fair value at each reporting period, with any changes in the value recorded as income or expense, which could adversely affect our operating results in a particular period.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nA higher rate of customer terminations associated with our hosted services would negatively affect our business by reducing our revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nOur churn rate, as defined in Item 7, for our hosted services could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service. Other factors, including increased competition from other VoIP providers, alternative technologies, and adverse business conditions also adversely influence our churn rate.\nBecause of churn, we have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis or sell additional services to existing customers to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. If our churn rate increases, we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues. We incur significant upfront costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted, our revenue could decrease and our net income could decrease.\nSuccess of our hosted services is dependent on the general growth and public acceptance of hosted communications.\nOur future success depends on our ability to significantly increase revenues generated from our hosted services. VoIP networks must improve quality of service for real-time communications, managing effects such as packet jitter, packet loss, and unreliable bandwidth, so that service can be consistently provided. VoIP telephony equipment and services must achieve a similar level of reliability that users of the Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) or a Multiprotocol Line Switching network have come to expect from their telephone service, and the cost and feature benefits of VoIP must be sufficient to cause customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers. If any or all of these factors fail to occur, our business may be affected adversely.\nOur business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our telephones and switches. Our reliance on contract manufacturers involves a number of potential risks, including the absence of adequate capacity, financial viability, ownership of certain elements of electronic designs, the ongoing viability of those contract manufacturers, and reduced control over delivery schedules.\nWe depend on our contract manufacturers to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity. Global economic conditions could adversely impact the financial condition of our contract manufacturers and their suppliers that could impact our contract manufacturer\u2019s ability to procure components or otherwise manufacture our products. We may be unable to procure timely delivery of acceptable products to our enterprise customers or incur substantially higher product costs if we move production to other contract manufacturers.\nOur contract manufacturers may not have sufficient capacity to enable them to meet the demand for our products. Our contract manufacturers could have manufacturing engagements with companies that are much larger than we are and whose production needs are much greater than ours. As a result, our contract manufacturers may choose to reallocate resources to the production of products other than ours if capacity is limited.\nIn addition, our contract manufacturers do not have any written contractual obligation to accept any purchase order that we submit for the manufacture of any of our products nor do we have any assurance that our contract manufacturers will agree to manufacture and supply any or all of our requirements for our products. Furthermore, our contract manufacturers may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or seek to increase the prices they charge us upon written notice subject to the terms of our agreement. As a result, we are not assured that our current manufacturers will continue to provide us with an uninterrupted supply of products at an acceptable price in the future.\nEven if our contract manufacturers accept and fulfill our orders, it is possible that the products may not meet our specifications. Because we do not control the final assembly and quality assurance of our products, there is a possibility that these products may contain defects or otherwise not meet our quality standards, which could result in warranty claims against us that could adversely affect our operating results and future sales.\nIf our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes and to meet our quality specifications, or if they significantly increase their prices, whether caused by uncertain global economic conditions, tightening of the credit markets, their weak financial condition or otherwise, we will have to procure components on their behalf in the short term and identify one or more acceptable alternative contract manufacturers. The process of identifying and qualifying a new contract manufacturer can be time consuming, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative contract manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices. Additionally, transitioning to new contract manufacturers may cause delays in supply if the new contract manufacturers have difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications or quality standards and may result in unexpected costs to our business.\nAny disruption in the supply of products from our contract manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales, an increase in lead times on inventory orders and an increase in production costs resulting in lower gross product margins, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf the emerging market for enterprise IP and hosted telecommunications systems does not continue to grow and if we do not increase our market share, our future business could be harmed.\nThe market for Unified Communications is evolving rapidly and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants. As is typical of a rapidly evolving industry, the demand for and market acceptance of, enterprise IP and hosted telecommunications systems products and services are uncertain. Some analysts have estimated that revenue in the Worldwide Enterprise IP Telephony industry has declined and will continue to decline. We cannot assure you that enterprise telecommunications systems that operate on IP networks will become widespread. In particular, enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other means of communicating information may be reluctant or slow to implement an IP telecommunications system that can require significant initial capital expenditures. If the demand for enterprise IP and hosted telecommunications systems fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, our solutions could fail to achieve market acceptance, which in turn could significantly harm our business.\nMoreover, as IP-based data communications and telecommunications usage grow, the infrastructure used to support these services, whether public or private, may not be able to support the demands placed on them and their performance or reliability may decline.\nOur sales cycle for some of our solutions can be lengthy and unpredictable, which makes it difficult to forecast the amount of our sales and operating expenses in any particular period.\nThe sales cycle for some of our solutions typically ranges from six to twelve months, or longer. As a result, we may have limited ability to forecast whether or in which period a sale will occur. The success of our sales process is subject to many factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including:\n\u2022 the timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles and approval processes;\n\u2022 a technical evaluation or trial by potential enterprise customers;\n\u2022 our ability to introduce new products, features or functionality in a manner that suits the needs of a particular enterprise customer;\n\u2022 the announcement or introduction of competing products; and\n\u2022 the strength of existing relationships between our competitors and potential enterprise customers.\nWe may expend substantial time, effort and money educating our current and prospective enterprise customers as to the value of, and benefits delivered by, our solutions and ultimately fail to produce a sale. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant resources, our operating results will be adversely affected. Furthermore, if sales forecasted for a particular period do not occur in such period, our operating results for that period could be substantially lower than anticipated and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur products incorporate some sole sourced components and the inability of these sole source suppliers to provide adequate supplies of these components may prevent us from selling our products for a significant period of time or limit our ability to deliver sufficient amounts of our products.\nWe rely on sole or limited numbers of suppliers for several key components utilized in the assembly of our products. We do not have supply agreements with our sole source suppliers, and the components for our products are typically procured by our contract manufacturers. If we lose access to these components we may not be able to sell our products for a significant period of time, and we could incur significant costs to redesign our products or to qualify alternative suppliers.\nIn addition, any increase in the price of these components could reduce our gross margin and adversely impact our profitability. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components to meet the demands of enterprise customers in a timely manner or prices of these components may increase. In addition, problems with respect to yield and quality of these components and timeliness of deliveries could occur. These delays could also materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to offer high quality customer support and services, our business could suffer.\nOur customers depend on our support organization and/or our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our solutions. A high level of customer support and services is important for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we or our channel partners do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell our solutions to existing customers could suffer and our reputation with potential customers could be harmed. Many of our channel partners offer primary support for the products they sell to customers. If the channel partners fail to provide timely and effective services, our business could be harmed. As we expand our sales, we will be required to hire and train additional support personnel. In addition, as we expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. If we fail to maintain high quality customer support or to grow our support organization to match any future sales growth, our business may suffer.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast demand for our hardware products, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and harm our business.\nWe generate forecasts of future demand for our hardware products several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers and typically prior to receiving a purchase order from our customers. We therefore make significant investments before our resellers or customers place orders to purchase our products and before we know if corresponding shipment forecasts will be changed. Our resellers and customers are not\ncontractually bound by the forecasts they provide us until they sign a purchase order, and the orders we ultimately receive often differ from original forecasts. If we underestimate demand for our hardware products, we will have inadequate inventory, which could result in delays in shipments, loss of orders and reduced revenues. This is exacerbated by the fact that lead times for materials and components that we need can vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. On the other hand, if we overestimate demand for our products and increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize, we will have excess inventory and we will face a risk of significant inventory write-downs. Our failure to forecast demand accurately on a timely basis could result in a decrease in our revenues and gross margins.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new software, services and features in a timely manner, or if we fail to manage solution transitions, we could experience decreased revenue or decreased selling prices in the future.\nDue to the complexity of the type of solutions we produce, there are significant technical risks that may affect our ability to introduce new solutions and features successfully. In addition, we must commit significant resources to developing new software, services and features before knowing whether our investments will result in software and services that are accepted by the market. The success of new software and services depends on many factors, including the ability of our software and services to compete with the offerings from our competitors, cost, and reliability.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new software and services in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or enterprise customer requirements, or if these software and services do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIntroductions by us in future periods may also reduce demand for, or cause price declines with respect to, our existing software and services. As new or enhanced software and services are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older solutions, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that sufficient supplies of new solutions can be delivered to meet enterprise customer demand. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and other operating results.\nOur solutions are highly complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors, which could harm our reputation and future sales.\nBecause our customers rely on our solutions for critical aspects of their business, any failure to provide high quality and reliable solutions, whether caused by our own failure, failures by our contract manufacturer or suppliers or outages in our data centers, could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our solutions. Software products may contain defects, and as such our products have in the past contained, and may in the future contain, undetected errors or defects. Some errors may only be discovered after a product has been installed or a service has been introduced and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue, loss of customers and increased service and warranty costs, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Our purchase orders contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could be exposed to significant risks with our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022 our ability to comply with differing technical and environmental standards and certification requirements outside the United States;\n\u2022 difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 lower gross margins due to higher discounting;\n\u2022 greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 the need to adapt our solutions for specific countries;\n\u2022 availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\u2022 changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 tariffs, export controls and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules;\n\u2022 more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022 adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our solutions outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022 restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022 new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022 less access to the end customer where we use our two-tier distribution internationally; and\n\u2022 political and economic unrest and instability. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s recent referendum approving its exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a result of the referendum, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities that may adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our international assets and investments. In addition, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could result in a global economic downturn, which could depress the demand for our solutions.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business.\nWe could be the subject of malicious cyber acts or experience other breaches of network security.\nIn providing our services, we store, process and transmit confidential and sensitive information including financial, credit card, account and personal information which may be protected by regulations. We may be subject to cyber threats and network security breaches by employees or third parties. Our ability to securely handle such sensitive information is critical to our business. In addition, laws requiring notification of individuals regarding security breaches related to their personal information continue to be adopted and evolve. Security breaches regarding personal information and compliance with such notification requirements could lead to significant costs for compliance, regulatory fines and other liability. Such security breaches could also harm our reputation and negatively impact our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers.\nFurther, to the extent that we represent to our customers that we are compliant with particular laws regulating the handling of confidential or sensitive information, such as HIPAA or PCI, any network security breach relating to such information may expose us to claims of unfair trade practices for misrepresenting our level of compliance, truth in advertising claims, investigations by federal and state law enforcement agencies, fines, penalties and other legal liability.\nWe continuously monitor the security of our networks and implement protective measures to prevent cyber threats. However, as cyber threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may not be able to address all such cyber threats, and the costs to continually protect against or remediate such cyber threats may adversely impact our profitability or increase the price of our offerings making them less competitive.\nThe agreement governing our loan imposes restrictions on our business that may limit our business opportunities and hinder our ability to execute our business strategy.\nOur Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) contains, and other agreements we may enter into in the future may contain, covenants imposing restrictions on our business, and requires us to maintain certain financial covenants. These restrictions and covenants may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, create liens, consolidate or merge, dispose of any property, redeem common stock or make other distributions to stockholders, make investments or enter into transactions with affiliates.\nAlthough we believe we are in compliance with all of our non-financial and financial covenants under the Credit Facility, our future ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. In the event of our default under the Credit Facility, our lender could declare all amounts borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay any debt owed, the lender could proceed against the collateral securing that debt.\nWe might require additional capital or debt to support our business in the future, and this financing might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf our cash and cash equivalents balances are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through additional debt or equity financings, to fund our operations. We may also need to raise additional capital to take advantage of new business or acquisition opportunities. We may seek to raise capital by, among other things:\n\u2022 issuing additional common stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022 issuing debt securities; or\n\u2022 increasing or replacing our credit facility.\nWe may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. In addition, if we were to raise cash through a debt financing, such debt may impose conditions or restrictions on our operations, which could adversely affect our business. If new sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable, we would be required to modify our operating plans to the extent of available funding, which would harm our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nAny denial or disruption of our hosted services whether from cyber attacks or failure in our physical infrastructure could lead to significant costs, reduce our revenue, and inhibit our ability to obtain future orders.\nOur hosted services may be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including without limitation, cyber attacks or failures in the physical infrastructure network. We may be the subject of unauthorized entry, computer viruses, malicious software programs, or other forms of cyber attacks aimed to disrupt our services. While we implement backup systems, mitigation efforts and procedures and other security protocols to mitigate such attacks, we cannot assure you that such protocols will be sufficient now or in the future to prevent such cyber attacks.\nThe physical infrastructure network for our hosted services is operated by external companies in data centers. The network and data centers are subject to various points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. Because our services do not require geographic proximity of our data centers to our customers, our infrastructure is consolidated into a few large facilities. Any failure or downtime in one of our leased data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our customers. The destruction or severe impairment of any of our leased data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of customer data. Additionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing leased data center facilities from time to time, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server relocation or other unforeseen construction-related issues.\nBecause our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our reputation. We have taken and continue to take steps to improve our infrastructure to prevent service interruptions. However, service interruptions continue to be a significant risk for us and could materially impact our business.\nAny future service interruptions could:\n\u2022 cause our customers to seek damages for losses incurred;\n\u2022 require us to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities;\n\u2022 affect our reputation as a reliable provider of hosting services;\n\u2022 cause existing customers to cancel or elect to not renew their contracts; or\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to attract new customers.\nAny of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce our revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe could experience breaches in physical security or problems with our information systems.\nOur business and operations depend on information systems, including those of third parties, to process customer orders, bill customers, provide technical support, and support accounting functions and financial planning. We have in the past and may in the future experience problems with our information systems that cause interruption in our business operations and our ability to respond to customer needs. Information systems are vulnerable to interruption for a variety of reasons, including without limitation, computer viruses, breaches of physical security, breaches of information security, and problems with third-party providers. The implementation of new information systems and the maintenance or upgrading of existing information systems may cause disruption to our operations and business and damage our reputation with customers. Such implementations can also be more expensive than estimated and divert management attention.\nFraudulent schemes could harm our business reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThird parties have in the past and may continue to attempt in the future to defraud our customers and us by fraudulently inducing employees or consultants into disclosing account information, user names, passwords, personal identification numbers, or customer proprietary network information. Other fraudulent schemes can result in unauthorized use of services or access to customer account information or data. Breaches of network security, or the failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results. For example, we may be unable to prevent our customers from incurring charges from fraudulent international toll calls made with their phone numbers. We may be required to pay such fraudulent charges without reimbursement from our customers, and our reputation may be harmed. If our customer credit cards are compromised or people use stolen credit cards to pay for services, we may incur costs which may not be reimbursed or we may not be able to recover payment for our services.\nIf third-party technology and intellectual property included, or that we intend to include, in our solutions becomes unavailable to us, our software releases could be delayed while we license or develop equivalent technology or intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nWe incorporate certain third-party technologies and intend to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology or updates to those technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in product or software releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current solutions. These delays, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf a third party asserts that we are infringing on its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, which could harm our business.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends, in part, upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d and individuals, own or claim to own intellectual property relating\nto our industry and may have substantially larger and broader patent portfolios than we do. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Third parties have in the past sent us correspondence regarding their intellectual property and have filed litigation against us, and in the future we may receive claims that our products infringe or violate their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or products. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from selling our products, damage our reputation, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, any of which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may decide to pay substantial settlement costs in connection with any claim or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted against us. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nLitigation with respect to intellectual property rights in our industry is not uncommon and can often involve patent holding companies who have little or no product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation, which could further exhaust our resources. Furthermore, as a result of an intellectual property challenge, we may be required to enter into royalty, license or other agreements. We may not be able to obtain these agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may have to incur substantial cost in re-designing our solutions to avoid infringement claims. In addition, disputes regarding our intellectual property rights may deter distributors from selling our products and dissuade potential customers from purchasing such solutions. As such, third-party claims with respect to intellectual property may increase our cost of goods sold or reduce the sales of our solutions, and may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business.\nOur success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, enterprise customers, strategic partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued. Even if patents are issued, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights or our solutions against competitors, and third-parties may challenge the scope, validity and/or enforceability of our issued patents. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect such rights. We may not be able to detect infringement, and may lose our competitive advantage before we are able to do so. In the event that we detect any infringement of our intellectual property rights, we intend to enforce such rights vigorously, and from time to time we may initiate claims against third parties that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success also depends on our ability to handle a large number of simultaneous calls, which our network may not be able to accommodate.\nWe expect the volume of simultaneous calls to increase significantly as our subscriber base grows. Our network hardware and software may be strained by heavy volume. If we fail to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance, or if our service is disrupted, our reputation could be hurt and we could lose customers or have to issues credits or refunds, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, under the current rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our and our auditor\u2019s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the SEC, The NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities or subject to litigation. To the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings.\nCatastrophic disasters or other events beyond our control such as earthquakes and hurricanes could damage our facilities or the facilities of our contract manufacturer or third party data center locations, which could cause us to curtail our operations.\nOur principal offices and some of our disaster recovery sites are located in California near known earthquake fault zones and, therefore, are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and other similar events beyond our control such as acts of war or terrorism. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. For example, power loss from natural disasters could cause outages to our data centers and interruption of service to our customers. Such outages could have an adverse effect on our brand, cause us to issue credits to our customers, increase our expenses from replacing equipment, and have other adverse effects on our results of operations. Natural disasters could also cause interruption of our information systems preventing us from responding to customer needs. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions.\nOur hosted services must comply with industry standards, federal, state and local regulations, and compliance may be costly and/or require us to modify existing services.\nOur hosted services rely on communication standards such as SIP and network standards such as Transmission Control Protocol/IP and User Datagram Protocol to interoperate with other vendors' equipment. There is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application, and about the definition of the standards themselves. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our services.\nWe must also comply with certain federal, state and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, law enforcement and billing issues, the provision of emergency calling services and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving regulations could delay or interrupt the sales of our services, subject us to fines or other imposed penalties, or harm the perception and adoption rates of our service, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur emergency calling services are different from those offered by traditional wireline telephone companies and may expose us to significant liability. There may be risks associated with limitations associated with emergency dialing with our services.\nOur emergency calling service differs from the emergency calling services offered by traditional wireline telephone companies. In each case, the differences may cause significant delays, or even failures, in callers' receipt of the emergency assistance they need.\nWe route emergency calls to a service aggregation vendor, who in turn routes the calls to the local Public Safety Answering Point, or PSAP. The PSAP should have automatic access to the customer's telephone number and registered location information. If the number is not associated with an address in an emergency call, then the call is routed by the vendor to an emergency response center where a live answer takes place and the address is determined for routing to the correct PSAP. If a customer moves their service to a new location, the customer's registered location information must be updated and verified by the customer. Until that takes place, the customer will have to verbally advise the emergency dispatcher of his or her actual location at the time of an emergency call. This can lead to delays in the delivery of emergency services.\nIn addition, in the event that a customer experiences a broadband or power outage, or if a network failure were to occur, the customer will not be able to reach an emergency services provider using our services. Delays our customers may encounter when making emergency services calls and any inability of the answering point to automatically recognize the caller's location or telephone number can result in life threatening consequences. Customers may, in the future, attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury or death suffered as a result of any failure of our emergency calling services.\nThere may be risks associated with our ability to comply with the requirements of federal law enforcement agencies.\nThe FCC requires all interconnected VoIP providers to comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (\u201cCALEA\u201d). The FCC allows VoIP providers to comply with CALEA through the use of a solution provided by a trusted third party with the ability to extract call content and call-identifying information from a VoIP provider's network. While the FCC permits companies like us to use the services provided by these third parties to comply with CALEA, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring the timely delivery of call content and call-identifying information to law enforcement, and for protecting subscriber privacy. While we believe we are currently CALEA compliant, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays related to meeting, or if we fail to comply with, any current or future CALEA obligations.\nReform of federal and state Universal Service Fund programs could increase the cost of our service to our customers diminishing or eliminating our pricing advantage.\nThe FCC and a number of states may consider reform or modifications to Universal Service Fund programs. Should the FCC or certain states adopt new contribution mechanisms or otherwise modify contribution obligations that increase our contribution burden, we will either need to raise the amount we currently collect from our customers to cover this obligation or absorb the costs, which would reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, the FCC has ruled that states can require us to contribute to state Universal Service Fund programs. A number of states already require us to contribute, while others are actively considering extending their programs to include the services we provide. We currently pass-through Universal Service Fund contributions to our customers which may result in our services becoming less competitive as compared to those provided by others.\nChanges in regulatory compliance obligations of critical suppliers may adversely impact our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), includes Section 1502, related to additional disclosure requirements for certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or conflict minerals, for which such conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. Our suppliers may use these materials in the production processes. We will have to perform supply chain due diligence, third-party verification and possibly private sector audits on the sources of these metals. Global supply chains are complicated, with multiple layers and suppliers between the mine and the final product. Accordingly, we could incur significant cost related to the compliance process. While the impact of Section 1502 on our business is uncertain at this time, we could potentially have difficulty in procuring needed materials from conflict-free sources.\nIncreased taxes or regulatory fees on our services will increase our customers' cost of using our services and/or reduce our profit margins (to the extent the costs are not passed through to our customers) and we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and additional taxes, surcharges and fees.\nWhere we have filed federal, state and municipal tax returns such as sales, excise and ad valorem taxes, fees or surcharges for the services we provide, the interpretation and application of the tax laws and regulations\napplicable in such jurisdictions may be in conflict with the interpretation held by the states and municipalities where we do business. Any increase or changes in our collection of these taxes, fees or surcharges may have the effect of decreasing any price advantage we may have over other providers. Our compliance with these tax initiatives may make us less competitive with those competitors who choose not to comply with these tax initiatives. We have accrued for taxes that we believe are required to be remitted. If our ultimate liability exceeds the accrued amount, it could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nChanges in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our business.\nChanges in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our solutions. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our solutions for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our solutions must comply with various requirements and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental and other health and safety regulations that may increase our costs of operations or limit our activities.\nWe are subject to environmental and other health and safety regulations relating to matters such as reductions in the use of harmful substances, the use of lead-free soldering and the recycling of products and packaging materials. These regulations generally require electronics producers to bear the cost of collection, treatment, recovery and safe disposal of past and future products from end users and to ensure that new electrical and electronic equipment does not contain specified hazardous substances. The cost of these regulations to us may be substantial and may divert resources, which could detract from our ability to develop new products or operate our business, particularly if we increase international operations. We may not be able to comply in all cases with applicable environmental and other regulations, and if we do not, we may incur remediation costs or we may not be able to offer our products for sale in certain countries, which could adversely affect our results.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and the development and maintenance of Internet infrastructure.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our solution and increase our operating costs. For example, in 2015, the FCC adopted rules intended, in part, to maintain net neutrality and to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks. It is possible that the FCC could modify or rescind this rule. To the extent network operators attempt to use other laws or regulations to extract fees from us to deliver our services or otherwise engage in discriminatory practices, our business could be adversely impacted. Internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our domestic and international growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe rely on third party network service providers to originate and terminate a significant portion of our public switched telephone network, or PTSN, calls, which could lead to business disruption if service providers ceased operations or terminated their services.\nWe leverage the infrastructure of third party network service providers to provide telephone numbers, PSTN call termination and origination services, private network access and local number portability for our customers rather than deploying our own networks. This decision has resulted in lower capital and operating costs for our business in the short term but has reduced our operating flexibility and ability to make timely service changes. If any of these network service providers cease operations or otherwise terminate the services that we depend on, the delay in switching our technology to another network service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWhile we believe that relations with our current service providers are good, and we have contracts in place, there can be no assurance that these service providers will be able or willing to supply cost-effective services to\nus in the future or that we will be successful in signing up alternative or additional providers. Although we could replace our current providers, if necessary, our ability to provide service to our subscribers could be impacted during this timeframe and this could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of access to, or requirement to change, the telephone numbers we provide to our customers also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nDue to our reliance on these service providers, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether caused by our service or another vendor's products, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur solutions contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products.\nOur solutions contain software modules licensed to us under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In this event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which requirements could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price in the past has been volatile, and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and investors may not be able to resell shares at or above the price at which they purchased the shares.\nOur stock price has fluctuated significantly. If investors purchase shares of our common stock, they may not be able to resell those shares at or above the price at which they purchased them. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022 the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those that sell communication products in particular;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our stock;\n\u2022 ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022 the public\u2019s response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, customer wins or losses, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;\n\u2022 market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 lawsuits threatened or filed against us and the outcome of such lawsuits;\n\u2022 shareholder activism;\n\u2022 future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022 speculation and uncertainty concerning the completion of our merger with Mitel; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Select Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have initiated securities class action litigation following declines in stock prices of technology companies. Any litigation may subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur historical revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter. Moreover, our actual or projected operating results for some quarters may not meet our own expectations, or the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, which may cause our stock price to decline. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results, including:\n\u2022 adverse conditions specific to the Unified Communications industry, including decreased demand due to overall economic conditions or reduced discretionary spending by enterprises, rates of adoption of UC systems and services and introduction of new standards;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain larger and more productive channel partners;\n\u2022 the purchasing and budgeting cycles of customers, in particular, the tendency of some customers to wait until the end of a quarter in the hopes of obtaining a better price;\n\u2022 the timing and volume of shipments of our products during a quarter, particularly as we experience an increased level of sales occurring towards the end of a quarter;\n\u2022 delays in purchasing decisions by our customers from one quarter to the next, or later;\n\u2022 seasonality in our target markets;\n\u2022 our ability to attract new channel partners, retain existing channel partners, and their ability to generate revenues;\n\u2022 changes in accounting rules;\n\u2022 timing of product introductions;\n\u2022 the timing of recognition of revenue from sales to our customers;\n\u2022 changes in the mix of our solutions sold during a particular period;\n\u2022 our ability to control costs, including third-party manufacturing costs and costs of components;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain sufficient production volumes for our products from our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022 volatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock-based compensation expenses;\n\u2022 volatility and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 the timing of costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022 our ability to successfully expand our international operations;\n\u2022 general economic conditions or economic recession;\n\u2022 a significant growth of hosted and related services sales causing a negative impact to our short term earnings due to how revenue is recognized for hosted and related services as compared to the timing of the recognition of certain related expenses;\n\u2022 decline in interest rates on our investments; and\n\u2022 publicly-announced litigation, and the impact of such litigation on our operating results.\nBecause our operating expenses are largely fixed in the short-term, any shortfalls in revenue in a given period would have a direct and adverse effect on our operating results in that period. We believe that our quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one period as an indication of future performance. If our revenues and operating results do not meet the expectations of our investors or securities analysts or fall below guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock may decline.\nA substantial portion of our product orders are usually received in the last month of each fiscal quarter, with a concentration of such orders in the final two weeks of the quarter. While we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order, we may have orders that have not shipped at the end of any given quarter. Because the amount of such product orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a particular quarter is not a reliable predictor of our future performance.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 established a classified board of directors, so that not all members of our board of directors may be elected at one time;\n\u2022 provide our board of directors with the ability to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 require the approval of two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022 allow a majority of the authorized number of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 do not permit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors;\n\u2022 set limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022 restrict certain litigation against us to be brought only in the State of Delaware.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding\nvoting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92207, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "SHOR"}
