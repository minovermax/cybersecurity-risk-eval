Additional risks about which the Company is not yet aware or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of the following occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. In that case, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline.\nBusiness Related Risks\nThe Company relies on a small number of key customers for the majority of its business, and the loss or significant reduction in business with any of these key customers would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nHistorically, the Company has been highly dependent upon sales of its products to Target and Wal-Mart. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, Target accounted for approximately 42% and 51%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues, and Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 31% and 28% of the Company\u2019s net revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net revenues during these periods. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, either Target or Wal-Mart would cause a material and adverse change in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results.\nFor example, commencing in the Spring of 2016, one of the Company\u2019s key customers discontinued retailing in its stores the Emerson-branded microwave oven and compact refrigeration products historically sold to this customer by the Company. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, net sales of these products by the Company to this customer were approximately $39.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively, comprising approximately 57.3% and 46.2% of the Company\u2019s total net product sales. The Company continued shipping these products to this customer only through December 2015. Emerson anticipates that net product sales for fiscal 2017 will be negatively impacted by this event. The loss of these sales has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of products for its sales.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our product revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our product revenues in the near term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised of five product types within two categories - housewares products and audio products, and two of these product types, namely microwave ovens and compact refrigerators - both within the housewares category - generated approximately 93% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales, with microwave ovens generating approximately 56% of the total and compact refrigerators generating approximately 37% of the total. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised of the same five product types within the same two categories - housewares products and audio products, and two of these product types, namely microwave ovens and compact refrigerators - both within the housewares category - generated approximately 95% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales, with microwave ovens generating approximately 67% of the total and compact refrigerators generating approximately 28% of the total. Because the market for these product types and categories is characterized by periodic new product introductions, the Company\u2019s future financial performance will depend, in part, on the successful and timely development and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of these product types and other products distributed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing these products types within these categories or any other new or enhanced products. As a result of this dependence, a significant decline in pricing of, or market acceptance of these product types and categories, either in general or specifically as marketed by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of our microwave oven and compact refrigerator products could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, commencing in the Spring of 2016, one of the Company\u2019s key customers discontinued retailing in its stores the Emerson-branded microwave oven and compact refrigeration products currently sold to this customer by the Company. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, net sales of these products by the Company to this customer were approximately $39.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively, comprising approximately 57.3% and 46.2% of the Company\u2019s total net product sales. The Company continued shipping these products to this customer only through December 2015. Emerson anticipates that net product sales for fiscal 2017 will be negatively impacted by this event. The loss of these sales has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIf the Company\u2019s third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s revenues could significantly decrease.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations, whose members are not employees of the Company. The Company\u2019s level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of its own employees. Some of these third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with the Company\u2019s permission, competitive products of third parties as well as the Company\u2019s products. During the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, these organizations were responsible for approximately 55% and 61%, respectively, of its net revenues during such periods. In addition, one of these representative organizations was responsible for a significant portion of these revenues. If any of the Company\u2019s third party sales representative organizations engaged by the Company, especially the Company\u2019s largest, fails to adequately promote, market and sell its products, the Company\u2019s revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by the Company. For example, despite the efforts of the Company\u2019s third party sales representative organization, one of the Company\u2019s key customers, commencing with the Spring of 2016, discontinued retailing in its stores the Emerson-branded microwave oven and compact refrigeration products currently sold to this customer by the Company and the Company continued shipping these products to this customer only through December 2015. The loss of these product sales will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues could be negatively impacted.\nThe concentration of product sales among a limited number of retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenues and profitability.\nWith the concentration of the Company\u2019s product sales among a limited number of retailers, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers whose bargaining strength is growing. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of houseware and consumer electronic products. As a result, there is significant competition for retail shelf space. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s key customers use their own private label brands that compete directly with some of the Company\u2019s products. As the retailers in the houseware and consumer electronic industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.\nThe houseware and consumer electronic industry is consolidating, which could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.\nOver the past several years, the houseware and consumer electronic industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the houseware and consumer electronic industry primarily consists of a limited number of large retailers and distributors. The Company\u2019s ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the houseware and consumer electronic industry or maintain or enhance its relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or the retailers\u2019 increasing use of private label brands.\nThe failure to obtain new licensees to replace the Funai license agreement could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and business.\nAs previously disclosed, on December 16, 2015, the Company\u2019s key licensee, Funai, provided written notice to the Company to terminate its license agreement with the Company effective December 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, Funai accounted for approximately 79% of the Company\u2019s total licensing revenue. Funai also contributes substantial product volume and market presence through Funai\u2019s manufacture and distribution of products utilizing the Emerson\u00ae brand name in the United States. The failure to obtain new licensees to replace Funai on satisfactory terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s licensing revenues and earnings. In addition, since the Funai license provides a substantial contribution to and enhancement of the Emerson\u00ae brand name in the U.S. marketplace, the failure by the Company to find a new licensee to replace Funai on terms satisfactory to the Company, or at all, would also materially and adversely affect the value of the Emerson brand and Company\u2019s ability to sell its housewares and audio products.\nThe failure by the Company to maintain its relationships with its other licensees or the failure to obtain new licensees could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and business.\nThe Company maintains agreements that allow licensees to use the Company\u2019s trademarks for the manufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products into defined geographic areas. Although the Company has entered into agreements with certain of its licensees most have terms of three years or less. The Company cannot assure that its agreements with its other licensees will be renewed in the future or that the Company\u2019s relationships with its other licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all. The failure to maintain its relationships with its other licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to the Company, the failure to obtain new licensees or distribution relationships or the failure by the Company\u2019s licensees to protect the integrity and reputation of the Company\u2019s trademarks could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s licensing revenues and earnings.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If our relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, we would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of our products and a material loss of net sales.\nAlthough there are multiple potential suppliers for each of the Company\u2019s products, the Company relies and is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its main products, all of which are located outside of the United States.\nThe Company does not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of its suppliers. Midea was the Company\u2019s largest supplier and accounted for 53% of the Company\u2019s purchases of products during fiscal 2016. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain existing relationships with its suppliers or to establish new relationships on similar pricing and credit terms in the future could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain products in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to obtain an ample supply of product from its existing suppliers or secure alternative sources of supply, it may be unable to satisfy its customers\u2019 orders, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers. Finding replacement suppliers could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues and liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nIncreases in costs of products may materially reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nFactors that are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the cost, quality and availability of the raw materials and components needed by suppliers of the Company\u2019s products, may affect the cost of such products, and the Company may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. As an example, when the prices of petroleum increase significantly, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted.\nIf the Company is unable to deliver products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in shipments to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders, and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation and timely and uninterrupted performance of its suppliers. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience operational difficulties with its suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. If the Company is unable to obtain products from these factories in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to its customers, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of its customers, as well as its relationships with its customers, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results.\nAll the Company\u2019s suppliers are based in China and as a result the Company is subject to risks associated with international operations and global manufacturing and sourcing including, among others:\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nlabor disputes, such as the 2014 Los Angeles/Long Beach port strike, and union actions;\n\u00b7\npotential political, economic and social instability;\n\u00b7\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npossible acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u00b7\nchanges in import and export duties and quotas;\n\u00b7\nchanges in domestic and international customs and tariffs;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties involving the costs to transport products;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the global transportation network;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u00b7\nregulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;\n\u00b7\nprotection of intellectual property;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nFurthermore, any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operation of the Company\u2019s principal logistics providers and shippers, including without limitation as a result of labor disputes, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. As a result, the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products in the United States and, if such third party logistics provider incurs any damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored or is unable to distribute its products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business.\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products. The facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored by such provider may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored could adversely affect its inventory and the ability of such third-party logistics provider to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, an inability to maintain the Company\u2019s contracts with such third-party logistics providers or a disruption or slowdown in the operations of such third-party logistics providers, including as a result of damage to the facilities of such providers or a strike by such providers, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, the Company\u2019s products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which\ncould adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s contract with its third-party logistics provider is terminable upon written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If the Company is unable to maintain its contract with its third-party logistics provider, the Company would be required to retain a new third party logistics provider and the Company may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to the Company. If the Company\u2019s shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase by such third-party logistics providers or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics provider and if the Company is unable to pass on these higher costs to its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot protect its intellectual property rights or if it infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns the Emerson\u00ae and other trademarks, which are materially important to its business, as well as other trademarks, patents, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain of the products that it markets and sells. The Company\u2019s trademarks are registered throughout the world, including the United States and other countries. The Company also has two patents in the United States on its SmartSet\u00ae technology, both of which expire in September 2018. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Company operates may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any trademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the Company. In addition, in the event third party licensees fail to protect the integrity of the Company\u2019s trademarks, the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to protect its proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect the license of its trade names, trademarks and patents to third parties as well as its ability to sell its products. Litigation may be necessary to enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, protect the Company\u2019s trade secrets; and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and the Company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block the Company\u2019s ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market its products and services in such jurisdiction. The Company may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. The Company cannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to the Company. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufacture or distribution of its products and could result in increased costs to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot anticipate market trends or enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. In addition, to increase the Company\u2019s penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for its products, the Company must maintain its existing products and integrate them with new products. The Company may not be successful in sourcing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. The Company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to the Company\u2019s products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, the Company\u2019s sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by the Company\u2019s competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company\u2019s products, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nCash generated by operating activities represents the Company\u2019s principal source of funding and therefore the Company depends on its ability to successfully manage its operating cash flows to fund its operations.\nThe Company does not maintain any credit facilities (other than certain letters of credit) in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has relied on, and continues to rely on, its cash on hand and cash generated by operations to manage its business. Subsequent to the appointment of the Provisional Liquidators over Grande, certain of the Company\u2019s major factory suppliers, including Midea, significantly reduced the maximum amount of open credit lines available to the Company and requested\nthat the Company make accelerated payments to them to reduce the balances owing from the Company on its open trade payable accounts with the respective factory suppliers to comply with such new credit terms. It is unclear what effect, if any, the completion of the Grande Restructuring Plan and removal of the Provisional Liquidators will have on the Company\u2019s relationships with its suppliers. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, the Company may need to secure alternative means of financing or reorganize its operations to continue to maintain the current business.\nForeign regulations and changes in the political, social and economic conditions in the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings materially and adversely.\nThe Company has operations in China and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales of products manufactured by third parties located in China. In addition, third parties located in China and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and could subject the Company to increased costs. Among the factors that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its costs are:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products and a decrease in its profits;\n\u2022\nChinese labor laws;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages affecting the Company\u2019s facilities and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities located in China;\n\u2022\nthe elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories that manufacture products for export;\n\u2022\nthe rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China;\n\u2022\nmore stringent export restrictions in the countries in which the Company operates which could adversely affect its ability to deliver its products to its customers;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for the Company to obtain and deliver its products to its customers;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain its products from its manufacturers or deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nnew restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardous substances; and\n\u2022\nthe laws of China are likely to govern many of the Company\u2019s supplier agreements.\nAny of the factors described above may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and/or increase its operating expenses.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in the industry in which it operates, which could cause material changes in the selling price of its products or losses of its market share.\nThe housewares and consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. The Company\u2019s products compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis of reliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson\u00ae trademark and quality service and support to retailers and its customers. The Company and many of its competitors are subject to factory cost increases, and the Company expects these pressures to continue. If these pressures are not mitigated by increases in selling price or cost reductions from the Company\u2019s suppliers or changes in product mix, or if the consumers of the Company\u2019s products change their buying habits as a result of the Company\u2019s actions, the Company\u2019s revenues and profits could be substantially reduced. As compared to the Company, many of its competitors have significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. As a result, the Company\u2019s competitors may be able to (i) adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; (ii) devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services; and (iii) respond more effectively to pricing pressures. Competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors expand their product mix or the Company expands into new markets. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of the Company\u2019s market share.\nIn addition, the industry in which the Company competes generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have begun to introduce their own private label products, which could reduce the volume of product they buy from the Company, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to the Company\u2019s\nproducts. If the Company is unable to protect the Company\u2019s brand image and authenticity, the Company may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products.\nChanges in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results to fluctuate and cause its stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from year to year, which may adversely affect its results of operations and the market price for its common stock. Factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\u00b7\nchanges in market and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe discretionary nature of consumers\u2019 demands and spending patterns;\n\u00b7\nvariations in the sales of the Company\u2019s products to its significant customers;\n\u00b7\nvariations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;\n\u00b7\nif the Company is unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements, it may not have sufficient inventory to deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion or the Company may have excess inventory that it is unable to sell;\n\u00b7\nnew product developments or introductions;\n\u00b7\nproduct reviews and other media coverage;\n\u00b7\ncompetition, including competitive price pressures; and\n\u00b7\npolitical instability, war, acts of terrorism or other disasters.\nThe Company could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which its product liability or other insurance may be inadequate.\nA failure of any of the products marketed by the Company may subject it to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of its products. Although the Company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which the Company considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that:\n\u2022\nits insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;\n\u2022\nadequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or\n\u2022\nits insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.\nAlthough the Company maintains liability insurance in amounts that it considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that such policies will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. To the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, the Company\u2019s expenses could materially increase.\nThe Company may be liable for additional tax payments to the IRS in connection with the extraordinary dividend paid by the Company to recipients on March 24, 2010.\nOn March 2, 2010, the Board declared an extraordinary dividend of $1.10 per common share which was paid on March 24, 2010. In connection with the Company\u2019s determination as to the taxability of the dividend, the Board relied upon information and research provided to it by the Company\u2019s tax advisors and, in reliance on the \u201cstock-for-debt\u201d exception in the Internal Revenue Code Sections 108(e)(8) and (e)(10), concluded that 4.9% of such dividend paid was taxable to the recipients. The Company initially withheld from the dividend paid to foreign shareholders an amount equal to the tax liability associated with such dividend based on this exception. In August 2012, the Company received a Form 886-A from the IRS which challenges the Company\u2019s conclusions and determines that the Company does not qualify for the above-referenced exception. The Company prepared and, on October 25, 2012, delivered its rebuttal to the IRS contesting the IRS determination.\nIn the event that the Company is not successful in establishing with the IRS that the Company\u2019s calculations were correct, then the shareholders who received the dividend likely will be subject to and liable for an assessment of additional taxes due. Moreover, the Company may be contingently liable for taxes due by certain of its shareholders resulting from the dividend paid by the Company. Any such liability, should it be required to be recognized by the Company, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in the period recognized. As of March 31, 2016, the Company believes that it is more likely than not\nthat the assessment period for the Company for tax under section 1461 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with the withholding tax requirements pertaining to the March 2010 dividend have expired, such that if the IRS were to attempt to assess tax, the assessment would be time-barred. Thusly, as of March 31, 2016, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be liable for such assessment; however, there can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in defending its position if the IRS were to attempt to assess tax. See Note 3 \u201cRelated Party Transactions-Dividend-Related Issues with S&T\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company electronically maintains sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of employees, in its facilities and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to the Company\u2019s operations. A breach of the Company\u2019s security systems and procedures or those of its vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of the Company\u2019s customers' or the Company\u2019s employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications the Company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving its employees. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures could misappropriate information.\nIf the Company fails to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, the Company may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject the Company to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause the Company to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.\nStock Ownership Risks\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, the Company\u2019s shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nGrande, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 56.2% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of June 23, 2016. As a result, the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. Under the NYSE MKT rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE MKT corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u00b7\na majority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u00b7\nthe Company has a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u00b7\nthe Company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThe Company has elected to use certain of these exemptions and the Company may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future for so long as the Company is a controlled company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors acts as the nominating committee and compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of the Company\u2019s executive officers,\nadministers its employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of its employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, the Company\u2019s lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that any executive officers who are also directors may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, shareholders of the Company do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE MKT.\nThe controlling ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock by an indirect subsidiary of Grande substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders, and the interests of Grande may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nGrande, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 56.2% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of June 23, 2016. As a result, Grande will be able to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business and have the ability to control the approval process for actions by the Company that require stockholder approval, including: the election of the Company\u2019s directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. Grande may have interests that differ from your interests and may cause the shares in the Company beneficially owned by Grande to be voted in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. In addition, several provisions of the Company\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of its common stock. Under the terms of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company\u2019s common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their relationships with Grande, and accordingly have loyalties and fiduciary obligations to both Grande and the Company.\nMr. Christopher Ho, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Duncan Hon, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, have material relationships with Grande that may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with their duties to the Company. Effective May 30, 2016, Mr. Hon also serves as the Chief Executive Officer and an executive director of Grande. As described in Note 3 to the Company\u2019s financial statements and in the Company\u2019s previous filings with the SEC, there have historically been certain related party transactions between the Company and certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Grande. Although the Company has established procedures designed to ensure that material related party transactions are fair to the Company, transactions between the Company and Grande, even if entered into on an arm\u2019s-length basis, create the potential for, or could result in, conflicts of interests.\nThe Company recently received a notice of non-compliance from NYSE MKT related to the composition of the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Although the Company has cured such non-compliance, if the Company is unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT, then the Company\u2019s common stock could be delisted from the NYSE MKT, which could negatively impact the liquidity and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn June 7, 2016, the Company received a notice from the NYSE MKT indicating that the Company no longer satisfied the continued listing standards set forth in Section 803(B)(2)(c) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide that require the Audit Committee of the Board to be comprised of at least two independent members. The Company received the notice following the resignation of five directors, including four independent directors, in late May and early June 2016 following the completion of the Grande Restructuring Plan. See Item 1 - \u201cRecent Developments.\u201d As a result of these resignations, the Company had only one independent director and the Company\u2019s Audit Committee was no longer comprised of two independent members as required under the Company Guide. Pursuant to Section 803(B)(6)(b) of the Company Guide, the Company was provided until the earlier of (i) the next annual shareholders' meeting or (ii) one year from the occurrence of the event that caused the failure to comply with this requirement; provided, however, that if the annual shareholders' meeting occurs no later than 75 days following the event that caused the failure to comply with the audit committee composition requirement, a smaller reporting company shall instead have 75 days from such event to regain compliance with the requirement to have two independent directors serving on the audit committee.\nEffective as of June 19, 2016, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Kin Yuen as an independent director and member of the Audit Committee, following which the Company regained compliance with Section 803(B)(2)(c) of the Company Guide. Although the Exchange\u2019s notification of non-compliance with Section 803(B)(2)(c), and the Company\u2019s subsequent cure of such non-compliance by the appointment of Mr. Yuen, has had no current effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s shares, failure to regain compliance within the prescribed grace period could have resulted in the Company\u2019s shares being delisted from the NYSE\nMKT. If the Company\u2019s common stock is delisted from the NYSE MKT and transferred to the over-the-counter market, it may result in decreased liquidity by making the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock less efficient.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors has formed a Special Committee of independent directors to explore strategic alternatives. However, there can be no assurances that any transaction will occur, or if such a transaction does occur, the value of that transaction to the Company or its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors formed an ad hoc Special Committee consisting solely of independent directors in March 2013 to evaluate possible strategic alternatives intended to enhance stockholder value. These alternatives could include, among others, possible joint ventures, strategic partnerships, marketing alliances, sale of all or some of our assets or other possible transactions. However, there can be no assurance that any such strategic transaction will occur. In addition, if such a transaction occurs, there can be no assurances as to the value of any such transaction to the Company or its stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81124, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "MSN"}
