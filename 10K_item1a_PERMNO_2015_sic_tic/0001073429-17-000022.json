Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors represent our current view of the known material risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. These important factors, among others, sometimes have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2017, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, common stock price, and the price of the 2024 Notes. Further, the risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial, or\nthat are not specific to us. This discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. Please see \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d preceding Item 1 of this report.\nBusiness Risks\nOur business depends on activity within the construction industry and the economic strength of our principal markets.\nWe serve substantially all end markets of the construction industry, and our results of operations are directly affected by the level of activity in the construction industry in the geographic markets we serve. Demand for our products, particularly in the commercial and industrial and residential construction markets, could decline if companies and consumers cannot obtain credit for construction projects or if the slow pace of economic activity results in delays or cancellations of projects. During 2016, commercial and industrial and residential construction accounted for 58% and 26% of our ready-mixed concrete revenue, respectively. In addition, federal and state budget issues may hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending, particularly street, highway, and other public works projects, which accounted for 16% of our revenue in 2016.\nWe operate principally in Texas, New York / New Jersey, and northern California with those markets representing approximately 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for 2016. Our earnings depend on the economic strength of these markets because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their price. Recently, the decline in the price of crude oil and natural gas has had an adverse impact on activity in the oil and natural gas industry in Texas, which has resulted in lower demand for construction services in Texas and consequently lower demand for ready-mixed concrete in Texas. If economic and construction activity diminishes in our principal markets or if lower demand persists in Texas, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks related to our internal growth and operating strategy.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022attract new customers;\n\u2022differentiate ourselves in a competitive market by emphasizing new product development and value added services;\n\u2022hire and retain employees; and\n\u2022reduce operating and overhead expenses.\nOur inability to achieve internal growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOne key component of our operating strategy is to operate our businesses on a decentralized basis, with local or regional management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations, profitability and the internal growth of the individual business. If we do not implement and maintain proper overall business controls, this decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices and our overall profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to successfully identify, manage, and integrate acquisitions could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nIn the past two years, we completed 14 acquisitions. On an ongoing basis, as part of our strategy to pursue growth opportunities, we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, the willingness of acquisition candidates we identify to sell; our ability to obtain financing or capital, if needed, on satisfactory terms; and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. The investigation of acquisition candidates and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed acquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nPotential acquisition targets may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities. In addition, if\nwe enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities, and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Our recently completed acquisitions and any future acquisitions could cause us to become involved in labor, commercial, or regulatory disputes or litigation related to any new enterprises and could require us to invest further in operational, financial, and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate, and effectively manage local or regional management and additional employees. Upon completion of an acquisition, key members of the management of the acquired company may resign, which would require us to attract and retain new management and could make it difficult to maintain customer relationships. Our inability to effectively manage the integration of our completed and future acquisitions could prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nTightening of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements or eliminations or limitations of the home mortgage interest deduction could adversely affect the residential construction market and reduce the demand for new home construction.\nApproximately 26% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was from residential construction contractors. While mortgage lending conditions have improved and lending volumes have increased since 2010, tightening of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements could adversely affect the ability to obtain credit for some borrowers, or reduce the demand for new home construction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the possible elimination or limitation of the home mortgage interest deduction could reduce the demand for new home construction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Another downturn in new home construction could also adversely affect our customers focused in residential construction, possibly resulting in slower payments, higher default rates in our accounts receivable, and an overall increase in working capital.\nOur ready-mixed concrete segment's revenue attributable to street, highway, and other public works projects could be negatively impacted by a decrease or delay in governmental spending.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 16% of our ready-mixed concrete revenue was from street, highway, and other public works projects. Construction activity on streets, highways, and other public works projects is directly related to the amount of government funding available for such projects, which is affected by budget constraints currently being experienced by federal, state, and local governments. In addition, if the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or reductions in government spending, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments, and declines in revenues, profitability, and cash flows. Reduced levels of governmental funding for public works projects or delays in that funding could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather.\nSince our business is primarily conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow, and heavy or sustained rainfall, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products, and impede our ability to efficiently deliver concrete. Adverse weather conditions could also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, delays in obtaining permits, time required to remove water from flooded operations, and similar events. In addition, severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Consequently, these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from one reporting period to another and may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.\nThe relative demand for our products is a function of the highly cyclical construction industry. As a result, our revenue may be adversely affected by declines in the construction industry generally and in our regional markets. Our results also may be materially affected by:\n\u2022\nthe level of commercial and residential construction in our regional markets, including reductions in the demand for new residential housing construction below current or historical levels;\n\u2022\nthe availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction from local, state, and federal sources;\n\u2022\nunexpected events that delay or adversely affect our ability to deliver concrete according to our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and lending standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our customers and business, which result in periodic variations in the margins of jobs performed during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of acquisitions and difficulties or costs encountered when integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe budgetary spending patterns of customers;\n\u2022\nincreases in construction and design costs;\n\u2022\npower outages and other unexpected delays;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs and maintain quality;\n\u2022\nemployment levels; and\n\u2022\nregional or general economic conditions.\nAs a result, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year. Furthermore, negative trends in the ready-mixed concrete industry or in our geographic markets could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWe may lose business to competitors who underbid us, and we may be otherwise unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nOur competitive position in a given market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, principally in residential construction. However, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, as well as price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Concrete manufacturers like us generally obtain customer contracts through local sales and marketing efforts directed at general contractors, developers, governmental agencies, and homebuilders. As a result, we depend on local relationships. We generally do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers.\nOur competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries or operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater manufacturing, financial, and marketing resources than we have, providing them with competitive advantages. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have competitive advantages over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do to invest in new mixer trucks, build plants in new areas, or pay for acquisitions also will have competitive advantages over us.\nWe depend on third parties for concrete equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease property, plant, and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including cement and other raw materials, necessary for our operations. We cannot assure you that our favorable working relationships with our suppliers will continue in the future. Also, there have historically been periods of supply shortages in the concrete industry, particularly in a strong economy.\nIf we are unable to purchase or lease necessary properties or equipment, our operations could be severely impacted. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers\u2019 needs or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, or distribution problems, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential construction and related demand for ready-mixed concrete has increased between 2012 and 2016. While cement prices increased as a result of this increased demand, cement supplies were at levels that indicated a very low risk of cement shortages in most of our markets. Should demand increase substantially beyond our current expectations, we could experience shortages of cement in future periods, which could adversely affect our operating results by decreasing sales of ready-mixed concrete and increasing our costs of raw materials.\nWe use large amounts of electricity and diesel fuel that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints, and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our financial position, operating results, and liquidity.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity and diesel fuel. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity from period to period.\nWe are dependent on information technology to support many facets of our business.\nIf our information systems are breached, shutdown, destroyed or fail due to cyberattack, unauthorized access, natural disaster or equipment breakdown, by employees, malicious third parties, or other unauthorized persons, our business could be interrupted, proprietary information could be lost, stolen or destroyed, and our reputation could be damaged. We take measures to protect our information systems and data from such occurrences, but as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, there can be no guarantee that our actions, efforts, and security measures adopted will always prevent them. Our business could be negatively affected by any such occurrences.\nThe departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nWe depend on the efforts of our officers and, in many cases, on senior management of our businesses. Our success will depend on retaining our officers and senior-level managers. We need to ensure that key personnel are compensated fairly and competitively to reduce the risk of departure of key personnel to our competitors or other industries. To the extent we are unable to attract or retain qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We do not carry key personnel life insurance on any of our employees.\nShortages of qualified employees may harm our business.\nOur ability to provide high-quality products and services on a timely basis depends on our success in employing an adequate number of skilled plant managers, technicians and drivers. Like many of our competitors, we experience shortages of qualified personnel from time to time. We may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy, and our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.\nCollective bargaining agreements, work stoppages, and other labor relations matters may result in increases in our operating costs, disruptions in our business, and decreases in our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 38.5% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, which expire between 2017 and 2020. Our inability to negotiate acceptable new contracts or extensions of existing contracts with these unions could cause work stoppages by the affected employees. In addition, any new contracts or extensions could result in increased operating costs attributable to both union and nonunion employees. If any such work stoppages were to occur, or if other of our employees were to become represented by a union, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, labor relations matters affecting our suppliers of cement and aggregates could adversely impact our business from time to time.\nParticipation in multi-employer defined benefit plans may impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe contribute to 15 multi-employer defined benefit plans, which are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d). For multi-employer defined benefit plans, the PPA established new funding requirements or rehabilitation requirements, additional funding rules for plans that are in endangered or critical status, and enhanced disclosure requirements to participants regarding a plan\u2019s funding status. The Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (the \u201cWRERA\u201d) provided some funding relief to defined benefit plan sponsors affected by recent market conditions. The WRERA allowed multi-employer plan sponsors to elect to freeze their current funded status at the same funding status as the preceding plan year (for example, a\ncalendar year plan that was not in critical or endangered status for 2008 was able to elect to retain that status for 2009), and sponsors of multi-employer plans in endangered or critical status in plan years beginning in 2008 or 2009 were allowed a three-year extension of funding improvement or rehabilitation plans (extending the timeline for these plans to achieve their goals from 10 years to 13 years, or from 15 years to 18 years for seriously endangered plans). A number of the multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute are underfunded and are currently subject to funding improvement or rehabilitation requirements. Additionally, if we were to withdraw partially or completely from any plan that is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the information available from plan administrators, we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full or partial withdrawal from or termination of several of these plans or the inability of plan sponsors to meet the funding or rehabilitation requirements would be material to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and minor variations in sales volumes.\nGenerally, our customers are price-sensitive. Prices for our products are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions, and market conditions, all of which are beyond our control. Because of the fixed-cost nature of our business, our overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and minor variations in sales volumes.\nInstability in the financial and credit sectors may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nAdverse or worsening economic trends could have a negative impact on our suppliers and our customers and their financial condition and liquidity, which could cause them to fail to meet their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations, and cash flows. The uncertainty and volatility of the financial and credit sectors could have further impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict or anticipate.\nTurmoil in the global financial system could have an impact on our business and our financial condition. Accordingly, our ability to access the capital markets could be restricted or be available only on unfavorable terms. Limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy. Ultimately, we could be required to reduce our future capital expenditures substantially. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations, and cash flows.\nIf one or more of the lenders under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Facility\"), which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $250.0 million, subject to the borrowing base, were to become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under that facility, our borrowing capacity could be reduced. Our inability to borrow additional amounts under our Revolving Facility could limit our ability to fund our future operations and growth.\nGovernmental regulations, including environmental regulations, may result in increases in our operating costs and capital expenditures and decreases in our earnings.\nA wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:\n\u2022land usage;\n\u2022street and highway usage;\n\u2022noise levels; and\n\u2022health, safety and environmental matters.\nIn many instances, we must have various certificates, permits, or licenses in order to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain required certificates, permits, or licenses or to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of certificates, permits or licenses, or failure to obtain new certificates, permits or licenses, could impede the implementation of any acquisitions.\nGovernmental requirements that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid and hazardous waste management and cleanup, and water quality. These requirements are complex and subject to change. Certain laws, such as the U.S. law known as Superfund, can impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault, including for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. Our compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, or the future discovery of environmental conditions may require us to make unanticipated material expenditures. In addition, we may fail to identify, or obtain indemnification for, environmental liabilities of acquired businesses. We generally do not maintain insurance to cover environmental liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage and increase our operating costs.\nOperating mixer trucks, particularly when loaded, exposes our drivers and others to traffic hazards. Our drivers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on construction sites, while our plant personnel are subject to the hazards associated with moving and storing large quantities of heavy raw materials. Operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, and environmental damage. Although we conduct training programs designed to reduce these risks, we cannot eliminate these risks. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe are consistent with industry practice; however, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations, and we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types or at levels we deem necessary or adequate, or at rates we consider reasonable. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe insurance policies we maintain are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows might be materially and adversely affected.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the accuracy and presentation of income taxes. This material weakness, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on internal control over financial reporting. This report must contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe previously identified and disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 relating to the accuracy and presentation of the accounting for income taxes, including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. Despite our efforts to fully remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, we had not done so as of December 31, 2016. We intend to continue to take actions to fully remediate the material weakness and to further improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, we can give no assurances that the measures we take will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nFailure to have effective internal controls could lead to a misstatement of our financial statements. If, as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision process may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our securities could decrease, and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable\nterms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nWe may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nOur operations involve providing products that must meet building code or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability, stress-level capacity, weight-bearing capacity, and other characteristics. If we fail or are unable to provide products meeting these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us, and our reputation could be damaged. In the past, we have had significant claims of this kind asserted against us that we have resolved. There currently are claims, and we expect that in the future there will be additional claims, of this kind asserted against us. If a significant product-related claim or claims are resolved against us in the future, that resolution may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSome of our plants are susceptible to damage from earthquakes, for which we have a limited amount of insurance.\nWe maintain only a limited amount of earthquake insurance and, therefore, we are not fully insured against earthquake risk. Any significant earthquake damage to our plants could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower our profitability and increase our business risk.\nThe nature of our business subjects us to product liability, property damage, personal injury claims and workers\u2019 compensation claims from time to time. Increased premiums charged by insurance carriers may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self-insured retention. If the number or severity of claims within our self- insured retention increases, we could suffer losses in excess of our reserves. An unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons. In addition, the availability of, and our ability to collect on, insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control. Further, allegations relating to workers\u2019 compensation violations may result in investigations by insurance regulatory or other governmental authorities, which investigations, if any, could have a direct or indirect material adverse effect on our ability to pursue certain types of business which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2024 Notes. We and certain of our subsidiaries are also parties to a Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cSecond A/R Loan Agreement\u201d), with certain financial institutions named therein, as lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and Bank of America, N.A. as agent and sole lead arranger, that is secured by certain assets of the Company and the guarantors. The Second A/R Loan Agreement provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $250.0 million subject to a borrowing base under the Revolving Facility. As of January 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility.\nThe negative covenants in the Second A/R Loan Agreement and the Indenture allow us to incur additional indebtedness from other sources in certain circumstances.\nAs a result of our existing indebtedness and our capacity to incur additional indebtedness, we are, and anticipate continuing to be, a highly leveraged company. A significant portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under our Revolving Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the 2024 Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit requires us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the repayment of our indebtedness, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, and such cash flow may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit limits our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and debt\nservice requirements;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase, because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nit may increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nit may restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to make payments on the 2024 Notes and our other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future sources of capital under the Revolving Facility otherwise may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we complete an acquisition, our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility and the 2024 Notes, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Second A/R Loan Agreement and the Indenture restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nWe may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt. This could intensify already-existing risks related to our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the Indenture and the Second A/R Loan Agreement contain restrictions on our and the guarantors\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or the guarantors could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, much of which could constitute secured, senior, or pari passu indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, our Revolving Facility provided for unused borrowing capacity of up to $221.3 million (after taking into account $12.6 million of undrawn letters of credit, $4.0 million of other availability reserves, and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility).\nThe Indenture permits us to incur certain additional secured debt, allows our non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in the Indenture.\nThe Indenture also, under certain circumstances, allows us to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. Those unrestricted subsidiaries will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and therefore will be able to incur indebtedness beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. If new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face could intensify.\nWe may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Second A/R Loan Agreement and the Indenture contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted under our Revolving Facility may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our Revolving Facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of, among other things, our eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and mixer trucks, and, under certain circumstances, our machinery. As a result, our access to credit under our Revolving Facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the administrative agent of our Revolving Facility in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. Our inability to borrow at current advance rates or at all under, or the early termination of, our Revolving Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Revolving Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nRepayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all of our tangible assets are owned by our subsidiaries. As such, repayment of our indebtedness, to a certain degree, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries (including any subsidiaries that are not guarantors) and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions or other payments to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal, and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the terms of the Indenture and the Second A/R Loan Agreement limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness.\nWe may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Revolving Facility and the 2024 Notes, before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 Notes.\nCredit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the 2024 Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure of the 2024 Notes.\nOur debt agreements may restrict our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Second A/R Loan Agreement and the Indenture impose, and future financing agreements are likely to impose, operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated indebtedness, or make certain investments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nsell assets and issue capital stock of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans to other U.S. Concrete entities or restrict the ability to provide liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nwith respect to the Indenture, designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Second A/R Loan Agreement also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests in certain circumstances.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, and other corporate opportunities.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and maintain these financial tests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, an event of default under the Second A/R Loan Agreement would permit the Lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the Revolving Facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Revolving Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our growth strategy.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in the Second A/R Loan Agreement, the Indenture or any agreement under which we have incurred other indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nThe Second A/R Loan Agreement contains certain covenants, including compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio if our Availability (as defined in the Second A/R Loan Agreement) falls below a certain threshold. In addition, the Revolving Facility requires us to comply with various operational and other covenants. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the heading \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of the financial covenants contained in the Second A/R Loan Agreement. Agreements governing our other indebtedness may also contain various covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay all obligations under our outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default. If we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, the Second A/R Loan Agreement, the Lenders could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against the assets securing their borrowings. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe Second A/R Loan Agreement provides the lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves or availability blocks or reduce the advance rates used to calculate the value of our borrowing base, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the Lenders will not take such actions during the term of that facility and, further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of such actions could materially and adversely impair our ability to make interest payments on the 2024 Notes, among other matters.\nCommon Stock Investment Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest all future earnings in the development and growth of our business. In addition, our Second A/R Loan Agreement and the Indenture prohibit us from paying dividends and future loan agreements may also prohibit the payment of dividends. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, business opportunities, contractual restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant. To the extent we do not pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022news announcements relating to us or our competitors, the job market in general, and unemployment data;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts;\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions;\n\u2022the arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022acquisitions or other transactions involving us or our competitors; and\n\u2022other developments affecting us, our industry, or our competitors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, third amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our third amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions could\ndiscourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, Delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our common stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 86915, "SIC": 3270, "TIC": "USCR"}
