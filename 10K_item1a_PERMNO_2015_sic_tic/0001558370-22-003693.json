RISK FACTORS\nOur business and investing in our securities involve significant risks, some of which are described below. Before you make a decision to buy our securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed in the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and related notes and in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and our growth prospects. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to the DraftKings Merger\nThe completion of the DraftKings Merger is subject to a number of conditions and the DraftKings Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms. As a result, there is no assurance when or if the DraftKings Merger will be completed.\nThe completion of the DraftKings Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the DraftKings Merger Agreement, including, among others, those described herein under \u201cPart I, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - DraftKings Merger.\u201d There can be no assurance as to when these conditions will be satisfied or waived, if at all, or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the DraftKings Merger.\nIn addition, if the DraftKings Merger is not completed by the outside date of May 31, 2022, which was automatically extended beyond the initial outside date of February 28, 2022 in accordance with the terms of the DraftKings Merger Agreement, either the Company or DraftKings may choose to terminate the DraftKings Merger Agreement. However, this right to terminate the DraftKings Merger Agreement will not be available to the Company or DraftKings if such party has breached in any respect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the DraftKings Merger Agreement in any manner that has proximately contributed to the occurrence of the failure of a condition to the consummation of the DraftKings Merger. The Company and/or DraftKings may elect to terminate the DraftKings Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, and the Company and DraftKings can mutually decide to terminate the DraftKings Merger Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time. If the DraftKings Merger Agreement is terminated, the Company and DraftKings may incur substantial fees in connection with the termination of the DraftKings Merger Agreement and will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the DraftKings Merger.\nThe termination of the DraftKings Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company and could result in payment of a termination fee.\nIf the DraftKings Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and the DraftKings Merger is not consummated, the ongoing businesses of the Company may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. In addition, the Company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities during the pendency of the DraftKings Merger, (ii) the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of completing the DraftKings Merger, (iii) the payment of certain costs relating to the DraftKings Merger, and (iv) the focus of the Company\u2019s management on the DraftKings Merger for an extended period of time in lieu of other matters, including the day-to-day operations of the Company. The market price of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of any such failures to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the DraftKings Merger will be completed.\nFurther, the Company may be required to pay DraftKings a termination fee of $55 million if the DraftKings Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the DraftKings Merger Agreement, including in connection with a material breach by the Company of its non-solicitation obligations under the DraftKings Merger Agreement. If the DraftKings Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company determines to seek another business combination or strategic opportunity, the Company may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the DraftKings Merger.\nThe pendency of the DraftKings Merger could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and DraftKings\u2019 respective businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\nBefore the DraftKings Merger is consummated or the DraftKings Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the pendency of the DraftKings Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding the Company\u2019s and DraftKings\u2019 businesses, including affecting the Company\u2019s and DraftKings\u2019 relationships with their respective existing and future customers, suppliers, business partners and employees. Such risks could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s and DraftKings\u2019 respective businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the market prices of their respective shares of Class A common stock, regardless of whether the DraftKings Merger is completed. In particular, the Company and DraftKings could potentially lose important personnel who decide to pursue other opportunities as a result of the DraftKings Merger. Any adverse effect could be exacerbated by a prolonged delay in closing the DraftKings Merger or if the Company and DraftKings are unable to decide quickly on the business direction or strategy of the combined company. Existing customers or suppliers of the Company and DraftKings may seek to change their existing business relationships or renegotiate their contracts with the Company or DraftKings or defer decisions concerning the Company or DraftKings, and potential customers or suppliers could defer entering into contracts with the Company or DraftKings, each as a result of the uncertainties relating to the DraftKings Merger. In addition, in an effort to complete the DraftKings Merger, the Company and DraftKings have expended, and will continue to expend, significant management resources, which are being diverted from the Company\u2019s and DraftKings\u2019 day-to-day operations, and significant demands are being, and will continue to be, placed on the managerial, operational and financial personnel and systems of the Company and DraftKings in connection with efforts to complete the DraftKings Merger.\nThe regulatory approvals required in connection with the DraftKings Merger may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions.\nCompletion of the DraftKings Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and neither we nor DraftKings can provide assurance that these approvals will be obtained. If any conditions or changes to the proposed structure of the DraftKings Merger are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the DraftKings Merger or reducing the anticipated benefits of the DraftKings Merger. If either we or DraftKings agrees to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the DraftKings Merger, the business and results of operations of the combined company may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nCompetition within the gaming industry is intense and our existing and potential users may be attracted to our competitors\u2019 offerings as well as competing forms of entertainment such as television, movies, sporting events, and other online/digital experiences. If our offerings do not continue to be popular, our business could be harmed.\nWe operate in the national gaming industry, itself a subsector of the broader entertainment industry, with our business-to-consumer offerings, including iGaming and online sports betting. Our users face a vast array of entertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as television, movies, sporting events and land-based casinos, are more well established and may be perceived by our users to offer a superior customer experience. We compete with these other forms of entertainment for the discretionary time and income of our existing and potential users. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our product offerings in comparison to other forms of entertainment, including new forms of entertainment, our business may suffer.\nThe specific industries in which we operate are characterized by dynamic customer demand and technological advances, and there is intense competition among online gaming and interactive entertainment providers. Several established, well-financed companies producing online gaming and/or interactive entertainment products and services compete with our offerings, and other well-capitalized companies may introduce competitive services. Such competitors may spend more money and time on developing and testing products and services, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing or promotional policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products or services than ours, which could negatively impact our business. Our competitors may also develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance. Furthermore, new competitors, whether licensed or not, may enter the online gaming industry. There has also been considerable consolidation among competitors in the entertainment and gaming industries and such consolidation and future consolidation could result in the formation of larger competitors with increased financial resources and altered cost structures, which may enable them to offer more competitive products, gain a larger market share, expand offerings and broaden their geographic scope of operations. If we are not able to maintain or improve our market share, or if our offerings lose popularity, our business could suffer.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 are complex and evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose or recommend measures intended to control its spread, including travel bans, business and school closures, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and implementation of other social distancing measures. We face several risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to macroeconomic impacts and well as the potential direct impact of the virus on our employees and operations.\nSuspensions, postponements and cancellations of major sports seasons and sporting events during the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted our sports betting business. On the other hand, business closures or capacity limitations, stay-at-home orders and other measures imposed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant increase in our iGaming business, as our offering is well suited for the current environment and consumers\u2019 other options for leisure and entertainment are limited. Total iGaming revenues in New Jersey were $1,337.0 million in 2021, representing a 43.5% increase over the same period in 2020. If and when the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic diminishes, or businesses are otherwise able to return to operations at or near pre-pandemic levels, we will face competition for consumers\u2019 discretionary time and income from many more forms of entertainment that were unavailable, or available on a limited basis, during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our growth may slow as consumers, including those incremental players acquired during the pandemic, have more choices for entertainment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused substantial uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. economy, including a recession and high unemployment rates. If the COVID-19 pandemic and economic consequences thereof, including high unemployment rates, persist for a prolonged period of time, the resulting reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income could have an adverse effect on our business. We expect that the longer the pandemic continues, and if repeat,\nresurgent or cyclical outbreaks of the virus continue to occur, the more likely it is that the pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and, consequently, our results of operations and financial condition.\nFinally, if a high percentage of our employees and/or a subset of our key employees and executives are infected or otherwise adversely impacted by COVID-19, our ability to continue to operate effectively may be negatively impacted.\nThe extent of the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, and we cannot predict the full impact it may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition; however, the effect on our results could be material and adverse.\nEconomic downturns and adverse political and market conditions beyond our control could adversely negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial performance is subject to global and U.S. economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by users, particularly discretionary spending for entertainment, gaming and leisure activities. Economic recessions have had, and may continue to have, far reaching adverse consequences across industries, including the global entertainment and gaming industries, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is substantial uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. economy, which may currently or in the near term be in a recession and has experienced rapid increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about the pace of potential recovery. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn addition, changes in general market, economic and political conditions in domestic and foreign economies or financial markets, including fluctuation in stock markets resulting from, for example: the COVID-19 pandemic; potential future government shutdowns or restrictions; geopolitical challenges, including global security concerns and the possibility of retaliatory actions or various measures taken in response to Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine; financial and credit market fluctuations or the unavailability of credit; and rising inflation may reduce users\u2019 disposable income. Any one of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nReductions in discretionary consumer spending could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending. Demand for entertainment and leisure activities, including land-based gaming and online gaming variants, can be affected by changes in the broader economy and consumer tastes, both of which are difficult to predict and unmanageable. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, sustained high levels of unemployment, and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions, including rising inflation and increased fuel costs, may reduce our users\u2019 disposable income or result in fewer individuals engaging in entertainment and leisure activities including iGaming and online sports betting. As a result, we cannot ensure that demand for our offerings will remain constant. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including a general tightening of availability of credit, decreased liquidity in financial markets, increased interest rates, foreign exchange volatility, increased energy costs, acts of war or terrorism, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence, sustained high levels of unemployment, significant declines in stock markets, as well as concerns regarding pandemics, epidemics and the spread of contagious diseases, could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities, such as gaming.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected economic conditions in the U.S. as well as globally and has caused a reduction in consumer spending. As of the date of this Annual Report, business closures or capacity limitations, stay-at-home orders and other measures imposed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant increase in our business, as our online offerings are well suited for the current environment and consumers\u2019 other options for leisure and entertainment are limited. Nonetheless, in ordinary circumstances outside of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, any significant or prolonged decrease in consumer spending on entertainment or leisure activities\ncould adversely affect the demand for our offerings, reducing our cash flows and revenues, and thereby materially harming our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our operating results, which make our future results difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur financial results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our financial results to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur financial results in any given period may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including the impact of seasonality, customer betting results, and the other risks and uncertainties set forth herein. Consumer engagement in our iGaming and online sports betting services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the user\u2019s level of satisfaction with our platforms, our ability to improve and innovate, our ability to adapt our platform, outages and disruptions of online services, the services offered by our competitors, our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns, among others. Any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIn our iGaming offering, operator losses can at times be limited per stake to a maximum payout, but there is content where the maximum win exposure is uncapped due to features in the game that can potentially trigger more significant wins. When looking at bets across a period of time, however, these losses can potentially be significant. Our financial results may also fluctuate based on whether we pay out any jackpots to our iGaming users during the relevant period. As part of our iGaming offering, we offer progressive jackpot games. Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a portion of the amount wagered by the user is contributed to the jackpot for that specific game or group of games. Once a jackpot is won, the progressive jackpot is reset with a predetermined base amount. While we maintain a provision for these progressive jackpots, the cost of the progressive jackpot payout would be a cash outflow for our business in the period in which it is won with a potentially significant adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. Because winning is underpinned by a random algorithm, we cannot predict with absolute certainty when a progressive jackpot payout will be incurred. In addition, we do not insure against random outcomes or jackpot wins.\nThe success, including win or hold rates, of existing or future iGaming and sports betting products depends on a variety of factors and is not entirely in our control.\nThe iGaming and sports betting industries are characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of iGaming or sports bet, on average, will win or lose after a significant number of iterations. Net win is impacted by variations in the hold percentage (the ratio of net win to total amount wagered), or actual outcome, on our iGaming and sports betting we offer to our users. We use the hold percentage as an indicator of an iGaming\u2019s or sports bet\u2019s performance against its expected outcome. Although each iGaming or sports bet generally performs within a defined statistical range of outcomes, actual outcomes may vary in accordance with statistical probability. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) may also (depending on the game involved) be affected by the spread of limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a user\u2019s skill, experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of users, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time spent gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates for our iGaming offerings and sports betting wagers may differ materially from theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings exceeding our expectations based on statistical law. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also has the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, cash flow and overall business operations.\nOur success also depends in part on our ability to anticipate and satisfy user preferences in a timely and effective manner. As we operate in a dynamic industry characterized by rapidly evolving legal standards and regulations, the scope of our potential product offerings is subject to rapid change, and as such our offerings will be subject to dynamic consumer preferences and expectations around said offerings that cannot be predicted with certainty. We need to continually introduce new offerings and identify future offerings that complement our existing platforms, respond to our\nusers\u2019 needs and improve and enhance our existing platforms to maintain or increase our user engagement and growth of our business.\nOur projections are subject to significant risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties, including assumptions regarding future legislation and changes in regulations. As a result, our projected revenues, market share, expenses and profitability may differ materially from our expectations.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and our projections are subject to the risks and assumptions made by management with respect to this industry. Operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on our assessment of factors that are inherently beyond our control and impossible to predict with certainty, such as the timing of adoption of future legislation and regulations by different states. Furthermore, if we invest in the development of new products or distribution channels that do not achieve commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, it may not recover the often material \u201cup front\u201d costs of developing and marketing those products and distribution channels or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels.\nAdditionally, as described above under \u201c- Reductions in discretionary consumer spending could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects,\u201d our business may be affected by reductions in consumer spending as a result of numerous factors which may be difficult to predict. This may result in decreased revenue levels, and we may be unable to adopt timely measures to compensate for any shortcomings in revenue and/or operating profitability. This inability could cause our operating results in a given period to be higher or lower than budgeted.\nOur growth prospects may suffer if we are unable to develop successful offerings or if we fail to pursue additional offerings. In addition, if we fail to make the right investment decisions in our offerings and technology platform, we may not attract and retain key users and our revenue and results of operations may decline.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to frequent changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in customer demands, preferences and regulations. We must continuously make decisions regarding which offerings and technology to invest in to meet customer demand in compliance with evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements and must continually introduce and successfully market new and innovative technologies, offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand, acceptance and engagement. Our ability to engage, retain and increase our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to successfully implement new offerings, both independently and jointly with third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platforms and offerings or develop and introduce new and unproven products, with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. The process of developing new offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain, and new offerings may not be well received by users, even if well reviewed and of high quality. If we are unable to develop technology and products that address users\u2019 needs or enhance and improve our existing platforms and offerings in a timely manner, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAlthough we intend to continue investing in innovative content and systems, if new or enhanced offerings fail to engage our users or partners, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments, any of which may seriously harm our business. In addition, management may not properly ascertain or assess the risks of new initiatives, and subsequent events may alter the risks that we evaluated at the time we decided to execute any new initiative. Developing new offerings may also divert our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. Even if our new offerings attain market acceptance, those new offerings could cannibalize the market share of our existing product offerings or share of our users\u2019 wallets in a manner that could negatively impact their economics. Furthermore, such expansion of our business may increase the complexity of our business and place a significant strain on our management, operations, technical systems and financial resources and we may not recover the often-substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing new offerings or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other offerings. In the event of continued growth of our operations, products or in the number of third-party relationships, we may not have adequate resources, operationally, technologically or otherwise to support such growth and the quality of our existing platforms, offerings or\nrelationships with third parties. Conversely, failure to effectively identify, pursue and execute new offerings, or to efficiently adapt our processes and infrastructure to meet the needs of our innovations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAny new offerings may also require our users to learn new skills to use our platform. This could create friction in the adoption of new offerings and new user additions related to any new offerings. To date, new offerings and enhancements on our existing platforms have not hindered our user growth or engagement. To the extent that future users are less willing to invest the time to learn to use our products, and if we are unable to make our products easier to learn to use, our user growth or engagement could be affected, and our business could be harmed. We may develop new products that increase user engagement and costs without increasing revenue.\nAdditionally, we may make poor or unprofitable decisions regarding these investments. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings, we may lose users or users may decrease their spending on our platforms. New customer preferences, superior competitive offerings, new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our existing offerings unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our platforms or business model. Our failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or evolving customer demands could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nOur growth inherently depends on our ability to attract and retain users, and the loss of our users, failure to attract new users in a cost-effective manner or failure to effectively manage our growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nOur ability to achieve growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new users to our offerings, retain existing users of our offerings and reactivate users in a cost-effective manner. Achieving growth in our database of users may require us to engage in increasingly costly sales and marketing efforts, which may impact our return on investment. We have used and expect to continue to use a variety of free and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and exciting games to achieve our objectives. For paid marketing, we intend to leverage a broad array of advertising channels. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms, change their terms around gaming, or if the prices at which we may purchase listings increase, then our costs could increase, and fewer users may visit our website. If links to our website are not displayed prominently in online search results, if fewer users visit our website, if our other digital marketing campaigns are not effective, or if the costs of attracting users using any of our current methods significantly increase, then our ability to efficiently attract new users could be reduced, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn addition, our ability to increase the number of users of our offerings will depend on continued user adoption of iGaming and online sports betting. Growth in the iGaming and online sports betting industries and the level of demand for and market acceptance of our product offerings will be subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We cannot assure that consumer adoption of our product offerings will continue or exceed current growth rates, or that the industry will achieve more widespread acceptance.\nAdditionally, as technological or regulatory standards change and we modify our platform to comply with those standards, we may need users to take certain actions to continue accessing our offerings, such as performing age verification checks or accepting new terms and conditions. Users may stop using our product offerings if the quality of the user experience on our platform, including age checks, terms and conditions acceptance, and support capabilities in the event of a problem, does not meet their expectations or keep pace with the quality of the customer experience generally offered by competitive offerings.\nWe may require additional capital to support our growth initiatives, and such capital may not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all. This could hamper our growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to make significant investments to support our growth in the entertainment and gaming industries and may require additional capital to address business challenges, including the need to expand to new markets, develop new offerings and features or enhance our existing platforms, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary\nbusinesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Our ability to obtain additional capital when required will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, capital markets conditions and other variables, some of which are uncertain. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our currently issued and outstanding equity, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when required, or on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Information Technology\nWe rely on information technology and other systems and platforms, and any failures, errors, defects or disruptions in such systems or platforms could diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability, disrupt our business, affect our ability to scale our technical infrastructure and adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. Our online gaming offerings, software applications and systems, and the third-party platforms upon which they are made available could contain undetected errors.\nOur technology infrastructure is provided by third-party providers critical to the performance of our platform and offerings. For example, our back-end platform, which is critical to the performance of our platform and offering, is provided by NYX Digital Gaming (USA), LLC (\u201cNYX\u201d), a subsidiary of Scientific Games Corporation. Our agreement with NYX provides for an initial four-year term for each state in which GNOG LLC conducts business, subject to optional one-year renewals thereafter unless either party elects to otherwise terminate. We pay NYX a fee based on a percentage of net gaming revenue, plus certain fixed costs. Further, technology provided by Ezugi NJ LLC (\u201cEzugi\u201d), an affiliate of Evolution Malta Limited (\u201cEvolution\u201d), is critical to the performance of our Live Dealer offering. Our agreement with Ezugi provides for a term through August 2021, and upon expiration, we have an agreement with Evolution to continue to obtain Live Dealer technology for an additional five years thereafter. Under both the Ezugi and Evolution agreements, we pay a fee based on a percentage of net gaming revenue generated by our own offering and, in some instances, generated by third parties utilizing our live studio, plus certain fixed costs. These third-party providers\u2019 systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be detrimental to our business.\nThe third parties on which we rely provide resources for network and data security to protect our systems and data. We cannot assure with certainty that the measures we and such third parties take to prevent or reduce the likelihood of cyber-attacks, protect their systems, data and user information, to prevent outages, to prevent data or information loss and fraud, and to prevent or detect security breaches, will provide absolute security. We have experienced, and we may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems resulting from a variety of factors, including internet and application connection issues, infrastructure failure and changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. Such disruptions have not had a material impact on us to date; however, future disruptions from unauthorized access to, fraudulent manipulation of, or tampering with our computer systems and technological infrastructure, or those of third parties, could result in a wide range of negative outcomes, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nSome of our third-party platforms and systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Ours and our third-party service providers\u2019 disaster recovery do not offer full offsite failover recovery, which could result in our operations and offerings being offline for a period of time to sufficiently recover any impacted third-party infrastructure and recover the latest available data, as well as any time required to receive the required regulatory approvals.\nWe own and operate our live dealer studio connectivity and technical infrastructure; however, the data center and key services such as security and access, surveillance, network and connectivity, electricity and cooling are provided by third parties. These third-party providers have experienced issues in the past and any such issues in the future could have a material impact on our ability to provide live dealer services to our and our partner customers. Any such material impact could result in a material effect to our revenues and partner customer confidence in our ability to provide reliable live dealer services. Any such loss of partner customer confidence could result in such partner customers moving to\ncompetitor live dealer services and studios. We rely on facilities, components and services supplied by third parties, including data center facilities and cloud storage services. If these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services, experience operational interference or disruptions, breach their agreements with us, fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations or experience a cybersecurity incident, our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected. Any such disruption or negative impact could result in an extensive interruption in our operations and damage to our reputation and brand, materially and adversely affecting our business. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and other events.\nAdditionally, our offerings may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch. If a particular offering is unavailable when users attempt to access it, or navigation through our platforms is slower than they expect, users may be unable to place their iGaming or sports betting wagers in time and may be less likely to return to our platforms as frequently, if at all. Furthermore, programming errors, defects and data corruption could disrupt our operations, adversely affect the experience of our users, harm our brand perception, cause our users to stop utilizing our platforms, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our offerings, any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nIf our user base and engagement continue to grow, and the amount and types of offerings continue to grow and evolve, we will need to allocate an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our users\u2019 needs. Such infrastructure expansion may be complex, and unanticipated delays in completing expansion projects may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not detected during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs. As such, we could fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands.\nWe believe that if our users have a negative experience with our offerings, or if our brand or reputation is negatively affected, users may be less inclined to continue utilizing our products or recommend our platform to other potential users. As such, a failure or significant interruption in our service would harm our brand\u2019s reputation, business prospects and operating results.\nDespite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure is vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches resulting from employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to users, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe secure maintenance and transmission of user information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit user information, or those of our service providers or our business partners have been in the past, and may in the future be, compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or employees of our third-party service providers or our business partners. As a result, our users\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our guests\u2019 consent.\nThe regulatory framework for the privacy and data security of our user information and employee information is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, and industry associations, have adopted or are considering adopting laws, rules, regulations and standards regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal and state labor and employment laws, state data breach notification laws, state data security laws and state privacy laws. Our failure to comply with data security and privacy laws, rules, regulations and standards could result in regulatory scrutiny and increased exposure to the risk\nof litigation, contractual liability, or the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal fines, penalties and assessments, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, allegations of non-compliance with privacy regulations, whether or not true, could be costly, time consuming, distracting to our management, and cause reputational harm.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties designed to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers, in an attempt to reduce the probability of breaches. Advances in computing capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in whole or partial failure of this technology protecting transaction data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. In addition, websites are often attacked through compromised credentials, including those obtained through phishing and credential stuffing. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to breach our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our websites, networks and systems that we or such third parties otherwise maintain. A security breach of our or our service providers\u2019 payment card systems may subject us to fines or higher transaction fees or limit or terminate our access to certain payment methods. We and our third-party service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attacks until after they have already been launched. Further, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers.\nIn addition, security breaches can also occur from non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or third parties. The risks of these security breaches may increase over time as we scale the business and the complexity and number of technical systems and applications we use increases. Breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access to our sites, networks and systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of user information, including users\u2019 personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of us or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our sites, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our sites; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to breach remediation, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, response to governmental investigations and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third-party experts and consultants; litigation, regulatory action and other potential liabilities.\nIn the past, we and our third-party service providers have experienced social engineering, phishing, malware, threatened denial-of-service and similar attacks, none of which to date has been material to our business; however, such attacks could in the future have a material adverse effect on our operations and third-party service providers. If a future breach of security should occur and be material, our brand\u2019s reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by said breaches and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability. We cannot guarantee that we or our third-party service providers\u2019 protocols and backup systems will be sufficient to prevent data loss. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nA party who manages to illicitly obtain a user\u2019s account information could access the user\u2019s transaction data or personal information, resulting in the perception that our systems are insecure. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data protection, data security, network and information systems security and other laws and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. We may need in the future to address problems caused by breaches, including notifying affected users and responding to any resulting litigation, which in turn, diverts resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our offerings.\nOur internal and third-party platforms contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under \u201copen source\u201d licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we and our third-party providers make available source code for modifications or derivative works we and our third-party providers create, or that we or our third-party providers grant other licenses to their proprietary software, based upon the type of open source software we and our third-party providers use. If we comingle any in-house software with open source software in a certain manner, we and our third-party providers could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release their proprietary source code to the public. This would enable our competitors to create similar offerings at a lower economic cost and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. In the past there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As such, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure that our processes for controlling the use of open source software in our platform will be effective. If we are determined to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to reengineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, proprietary source code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs in order to comply with software and app store guidelines and requirements. Non-compliance with such guidelines and requirements could limit our ability to distribute our apps and, consequently, could have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nMicrosoft, Apple, Google and other software and distribution providers that we use to distribute our apps and services continue to update their software development kits and app store guidelines. Our failure to comply with such guidelines and requirements could result in us being refused or restricted access to critical distribution channels. As an example, Apple recently released updated app store and software development guidelines that require all real money gaming apps to comply with Apple\u2019s native user interface requirements and content delivery mechanisms. Such updates require a fundamental change to the way all real money gaming operators develop and manage their app front ends and content. Further, updates and changes to software and app store guidelines and requirements may require us and our third-party providers to invest significant time and resources to redevelop solutions, which may result in significant costs for us. These changes can also limit the functionality of the user interface, competitive differentiation of the product and availability of content, which can have a material impact on our business and revenues. App stores are a critical distribution channel for our customers to download and access our software and services. At any time, an app store provider could decline an app submission or remove an app due to non-compliance with our software development kit requirements and store guidelines, which could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to distribute our apps and, consequently, a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nIf we fail to detect fraud or theft, including by our users and employees, our brand\u2019s reputation may suffer which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and can subject us to investigations and litigation.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of financial fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims of unauthorized payments by a user and attempted payments by users with insufficient funds. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving sensitive financial information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for use of funds on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction.\nActs of fraud may involve various tactics, including collusion. Successful exploitation of our systems could have negative effects on our product offerings, services and user experience and could harm our brand\u2019s reputation. Failure to uncover such bad actors could result in harm to our operations. In addition, negative publicity related to breaches of this nature could have an adverse effect on our brand\u2019s reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. In the event of the occurrence of any such issues with our existing platform or product offerings, substantial engineering and marketing resources and management attention, may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues, which may delay other projects and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Despite measures we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot say with certainty that any of our measures will be effective. Our failure to adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our brand\u2019s reputation, result in litigation or regulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Reliance on Third Parties and Affiliates\nOur business is dependent on agreements with certain of our affiliates, and our failure to comply with the terms of such agreements, or failure to maintain our relationship with Golden Nugget and its affiliates, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur right to host, manage, control, operate, support and administer the Golden Nugget-branded online gaming business in New Jersey and the third-party operators is governed by the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement between GNOG LLC and GNAC. We operate our online gaming business under GNAC\u2019s land-based casino operating licenses. There are certain circumstances under which the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement may be terminated in its entirety, including in the event of a party\u2019s material breach thereof or in the event of a change in law or adverse regulatory action that prevents the operation of the online gaming business. Termination of the A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement would eliminate our ability to operate our online gaming and sport betting business in New Jersey, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, all of GNOG LLC\u2019s business has been conducted under the Golden Nugget brand. Our ability to use the Golden Nugget brand is governed by the Trademark License Agreement among GNOG LLC, Golden Nugget and GNLV. Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, GNLV granted to GNOG LLC an exclusive license to use certain Golden Nugget trademarks in connection with operating iGaming and online sports wagering in the U.S., subject to certain restrictions, and GNOG LLC has agreed to pay Golden Nugget a monthly royalty payment equal to 3% of net gaming revenue for a term of 20 years from the closing date of the Trademark License Agreement. There is no guarantee that we will thereafter be able to renew or replace the Trademark License Agreement on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, there are certain circumstances under which the Trademark License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety (subject to applicable cure periods). Termination of the Trademark License Agreement would eliminate our rights to use the Golden Nugget brand and may result in us having to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or cause us to lose its rights under the Trademark License Agreement, including its right to use the Golden Nugget brand, which would require us to change its corporate name and undergo other significant rebranding efforts. These rebranding efforts may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nGNAC and Golden Nugget also provide certain services and facilities, including payroll, accounting, financial planning and other agreed upon services, to us from time to time pursuant to a Services Agreement. We are obligated to reimburse the party providing the service or facilities at cost. The Services Agreement may be terminated with respect to any party upon six months\u2019 prior written notice. If the Services Agreement is terminated, we will have to contract with another third party to provide such services or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are as favorable as those we receive from GNAC and Golden Nugget.\nWe rely on strategic relationships with casinos and other gaming operators to offer our products in certain jurisdictions. If we cannot establish and manage such relationships with these partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnder some states\u2019 gaming laws, online betting is limited to a finite number of retail operators, who own a \u201cskin\u201d or \u201cskins\u201d under that state\u2019s law. A \u201cskin\u201d is a legally authorized license from a state to offer online betting services provided by a casino. The \u201cskin\u201d provides a market access opportunity for mobile operators to operate in the jurisdiction subject to the appropriate licensure and other required approvals from the appropriate regulatory body. The entities that control those \u201cskins,\u201d and the numbers of \u201cskins\u201d available, are typically determined by state betting laws. In order to offer iGaming and online sports betting in Michigan, we currently intend to rely on a tribal casino in order to get access through a \u201cskin.\u201d We have also recently executed similar agreements in Illinois and West Virginia. A \u201cskin\u201d is what allows us to gain access to a jurisdiction where online operators are required to have a retail relationship. If we cannot establish, renew or manage our relationships, as it pertains to Michigan, Illinois and West Virginia or any other states we enter in the future, our relationships could be terminated, and we would not be allowed to operate in those jurisdictions until we enter into new relationships, which could be at significantly higher cost. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party providers to validate the identity and location of our users, and if such providers fail to accurately confirm user information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot guarantee that the third-party geolocation and identity verification systems that we rely on will perform effectively. We rely on these geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we follow certain laws and regulations, and any service disruption to those systems would prohibit us from operating our platform and would adversely affect our business. Additionally, incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from third-party service providers may result in us inadvertently allowing access to our offerings to individuals who are not permitted to access them, or otherwise inadvertently denying access to individuals who are permitted access them, in each case, based on inaccurate identity or geographic location determination. Our third-party geolocation services provider relies on our ability to obtain information necessary to determine geolocation from mobile devices, operating systems, and other sources. Changes, disruptions or temporary or permanent failure to access such sources by our third-party service providers may result in their inability to accurately determine the location of our users. Moreover, failure to maintain our existing contracts with third-party service providers, or to replace them with equivalent third parties, may result in our inability to access geolocation and identity verification data necessary for our operations. If any of these risks materialize, we may be subject to disciplinary action, fines, lawsuits, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by customers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process deposits and withdrawals made by customers on our platform. If any of our third-party payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on economically reasonable terms, we would be forced to find an alternative payment processor, and may not be able to secure favorable terms or replace such payment processor in a timely manner. Further, the software and services provided by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations or may contain errors or other defects, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these could cause us to lose our ability to accept\nonline payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to users on our platform, any of which could make our platform less well perceived by the market and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our users.\nNearly all of our payments are made by credit card, debit card or through other third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain regulations, contractual obligations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to users that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws, regulations and contractual obligations relating to the payments we accept from our users, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform less well perceived by our users. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the U.S. and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. Certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. Penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of material assets or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our payment processors require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to particular users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or the users on our platform violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our relationships with third-party information technology service providers. For example, we rely on third parties for online connectivity, infrastructure hosting, technical infrastructure, network management, content delivery, load balancing and protection against hacking and distributed denial-of-service attacks. If those providers do not perform adequately, our users may experience errors or disruptions in operations and services. Furthermore, if any of our partners terminates their relationship with us or refuse to renew their agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we could be forced to find an alternative provider and may not be able to secure similar terms in a timely manner. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners, including any publicity related to regulatory concerns, could adversely affect our brand\u2019s reputation and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nWe incorporate technology from third parties into our platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that the suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the technology in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors at their determination. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform containing that technology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop or own services which could be economically costly and negatively impact our operations. If alternative technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on internet and other technology-based service providers, if these parties experience business interruptions, our ability to conduct business may be impaired and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties, including internet service providers and other technology-based service providers. We require technology-based service providers to maintain adequate cyber security systems and processes. However, if these service providers experience service interruptions, including those due to cyber-attacks, or those due to an event causing an unusually high volume of Internet use (such as a pandemic or public health emergency), communications over the Internet may be interrupted and impair our ability to conduct our business. Internet service providers and other technology-based service providers may in the future roll out upgraded or new mobile or other telecommunications services, such as 5G or 6G services, which may impact the ability of our users to access our platform or offerings in a timely fashion or at all. Any difficulties these providers face, including the potential of certain network traffic receiving priority over other traffic (i.e., lack of net neutrality), may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little influence over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with their services. Furthermore, our ability to process digital transactions depends on bank processing and credit card systems. To prepare for system malfunctions, we continuously seek to improve our facilities and the capabilities of our system infrastructure and support. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that the internet infrastructure or our own network systems will be able to meet the demand placed on them by the continued growth of the internet, the overall online gaming industry and our users. Any system failure as a result of reliance on these third parties, such as network, software or hardware failure, including as a result of cyber-attacks, which causes a loss of our users\u2019 property or personal information or a delay or interruption in our online services and products could result in a loss of anticipated revenue, interruptions to our platform and offerings, cause us to incur significant legal, remediation and notification costs, degrade the customer experience and cause users to lose confidence in our offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nWe rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties, which are incorporated into our products and services. Failure to renew or expand existing licenses may require us to modify, limit or discontinue certain offerings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties, for use in our business-to-business and business-to-consumers offerings. Substantially all of our offerings and services use intellectual property licensed from third parties. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain and expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market. We cannot assure that these third-party licenses, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we cannot renew and expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property.\nSome of our license agreements contain minimum guaranteed royalty payments to the third-party licensor. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to offset the minimum guaranteed royalty payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our license agreements generally allow for assignment by us in the event of a strategic transaction but some contain limited termination rights in the event of an attempted assignment by us. Certain of our license agreements grant the licensor rights to audit our use of the licensor\u2019s intellectual property. Disputes with licensors over license agreements could result in the payment of additional royalties or penalties by us, cancellation or non-renewal of the underlying license or litigation.\nThe regulatory review process and licensing requirements also may preclude us from using technologies owned or developed by third parties if those parties are unwilling to subject themselves to regulatory review or do not meet regulatory requirements. Some gaming authorities require gaming manufacturers to obtain approval before engaging in certain transactions, such as acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations, financings, stock offerings and share repurchases.\nObtaining such approvals can be costly and time consuming, and we cannot assure that such approvals will be granted or that the approval process will not result in delays or disruptions to our strategic objectives.\nOur growth will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. Overreliance on certain third parties, or our inability to extend existing relationships or agree to new relationships may cause unanticipated costs and impact our future financial performance.\nWe rely on relationships with advertisers, casinos and other third parties in order to attract users to our platform. These relationships along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and ecommerce businesses direct consumers to our platform. In addition, many of the parties with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including other gaming platforms with whom we compete. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our platform, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fails to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, this could impact our ability to attract consumers in a cost-effective manner and thus harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nRisks Relating to Compliance with Gaming and Other Regulations\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. Any change in existing regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to our products and services, or changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to our products and services, could adversely impact our ability to operate our business as currently conducted or as we seek to operate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally subject to laws and regulations relating to iGaming and online sports betting in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, as well as the general laws and regulations that apply to all e-commerce businesses, such as those related to privacy and personal information, tax and consumer protection. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction and future legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental action, which may be affected by, among other things, political pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. Some jurisdictions have introduced regulations attempting to restrict or prohibit online gaming, while others have taken the position that online gaming should be licensed and regulated and have adopted or are in the process of considering legislation and regulations to enable that to happen. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a \u201csporting event or contest\u201d fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (\u201cWire Act\u201d). The DOJ\u2019s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ\u2019s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ\u2019s new opinion. The DOJ had appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which reaffirmed the district court\u2019s decision on January 20, 2021. If such ruling were to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, an adverse ruling or other disposition of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court could impact our ability to engage in online internet gaming in the future.\nFuture legislative and regulatory action, and court decisions or other governmental action, may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. Governmental authorities could view us as having violated local laws, despite our efforts to obtain all applicable licenses or approvals. There is also risk that civil and criminal proceedings, including class actions brought by or on behalf of prosecutors or public entities or incumbent monopoly providers, or private individuals, could be initiated against us, Internet service providers, credit card and other payment processors iGaming and online sports betting industries. Such potential proceedings could involve substantial litigation expense, penalties, fines, seizure of assets, injunctions or other restrictions being imposed upon is or our licensees or other\nbusiness partners, while diverting the attention of key executives. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as impact our reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that legally enforceable legislation will not be proposed and passed in jurisdictions relevant or potentially relevant to our business to prohibit, legislate or regulate various aspects of the iGaming and online sports betting industries (or that existing laws in those jurisdictions will not be interpreted negatively). Compliance with any such legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, either as a result of our determination that a jurisdiction should be blocked, or because a local license or approval may be costly for us or our business partners to obtain and/or such licenses or approvals may contain other commercially undesirable conditions.\nOur growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions and legalization may not occur in as many states as we expect, or may occur at a slower pace than we anticipate. Additionally, even if jurisdictions legalize real money gaming, this may be accompanied by legislative or regulatory restrictions and/or taxes that make it impracticable or less attractive to operate in those jurisdictions, or the process of implementing regulations or securing the necessary licenses to operate in a particular jurisdiction may take longer than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our future results of operations and make it more difficult to meet our expectations for financial performance.\nSeveral states have legalized or are currently evaluating the legalization of real money gaming, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects are significantly dependent upon the status of legalization in these states. Our business plan is partially based upon the legalization of real money gaming in additional states and the legalization may not occur as we have anticipated. Additionally, if a large number of additional states or the federal government enact real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain, or is otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate iGaming websites or online sports betting in U.S. jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in iGaming and online sports betting could be materially impaired.\nAs we enter new jurisdictions, states or the federal government may legalize real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to it. As a result, we may encounter legal, regulatory and political challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new opportunity. For example, certain states require us to have a relationship with a land-based, licensed casino for iGaming and online sports betting access, which tends to increase our costs. States that have established state-run monopolies may limit opportunities for private sector participants like us. States also impose substantial tax rates on online sports betting and iGaming revenue, in addition to a federal excise tax of 25 basis points on the amount of each sports wager. Tax rates, whether federal- or state-based, that are higher than we expect will make it more costly and less desirable for it to launch in a given jurisdiction, while tax increases in any of our existing jurisdictions may adversely impact our profitability.\nTherefore, even in cases in which a jurisdiction purports to license and regulate iGaming or online sports betting, the licensing and regulatory regimes can vary considerably in terms of their business-friendliness and at times may be intended to provide incumbent operators with advantages over new licensees. Therefore, some \u201cliberalized\u201d regulatory regimes are considerably more economically viable than others.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction, or the failure to successfully obtain a license or permit applied for in a particular jurisdiction, could impact our ability to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, or could cause the rejection of license applications or cancelation of existing licenses in other jurisdictions, or could cause financial institutions, online and mobile platforms, and distributors to stop providing services to us, which we rely upon to receive payments from, or distribute amounts to, our users, or otherwise to deliver and promote our services.\nCompliance with the various regulations applicable and real money gaming is costly and time-consuming. Regulatory authorities at the U.S. federal, state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the regulation of real money gaming operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our real money gaming licenses, impose substantial fines or take other actions, any one of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and business prospects. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations or enact new laws and regulations regarding these matters. We will strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our business. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules. Non-compliance with any such law or regulations could expose us to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nAny real money gaming license could be revoked, suspended or conditioned at any time. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for such a license in another jurisdiction, and any of such losses, or potential for such loss, could cause us to cease offering some or all of our offerings in the impacted jurisdictions. We may be unable to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, and could incur fines or experience delays related to the licensing process, which could adversely affect our operations. Our delay or failure to obtain or maintain licenses in any jurisdiction may prevent us from distributing our offerings, increasing our customer base and/or generating revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain and maintain the licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our iGaming and online sports betting operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nOur growth prospects and market potential will depend on our ability to obtain licenses to operate in a number of jurisdictions and if we fail to obtain such licenses our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects could be impaired.\nOur ability to grow our business will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain licenses to offer our product offerings in a large number of jurisdictions or in heavily populated jurisdictions. If we fail to obtain and maintain licenses in large jurisdictions or in a greater number of mid-market jurisdictions, this may prevent us from expanding the footprint of our product offerings, increasing our user base and/or generating revenues. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and maintain licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our iGaming and online sports betting operations. Any failure to obtain and maintain licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nIn some jurisdictions our key executives, certain employees or other individuals related to the business are subject to licensing or compliance requirements. Failure by such individuals to obtain the necessary licenses or comply with individual regulatory obligations, could cause the business to be non-compliant with our obligations, or imperil our ability to obtain or maintain licenses necessary for the conduct of the business. In some cases, the remedy to such situation may require the removal of a key executive or employee and the mandatory redemption or transfer of such person\u2019s equity securities.\nAs part of obtaining real money gaming licenses, the responsible gaming authority will generally determine suitability of certain directors, officers and employees and, in some instances, significant stockholders. The criteria used by gaming authorities to make determinations as to who requires a finding of suitability or the suitability of an applicant to conduct gaming operations varies among jurisdictions, but generally requires extensive and detailed application disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be found suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find an applicable officer, director, employee or significant stockholder of us unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file required applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects. See \u201cBusiness\u2009-\u2009Government Regulation.\u201d\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) provides that any of our capital stock owned or controlled by any unsuitable person or its affiliates will be transferred to us or one or more third-party\ntransferees, as and to the extent required by a gaming authority or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.\nAdditionally, a gaming regulatory body may refuse to issue or renew a gaming license or restrict or condition the same, based on our present activities or the past activities of GNOG LLC, or the past or present activities of their current or former directors, officers, employees, stockholders or third parties with whom we have relationships, which could adversely affect our operations or financial condition. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect our directors, officers, key employees or other aspects of our operations. To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for our operations. However, we can give no assurance that any additional licenses, permits and approvals that may be required will be given or that existing ones will be renewed or will not be revoked. Renewal is subject to, among other things, continued satisfaction of suitability requirements of our directors, officers, key employees and stockholders. Any failure to renew or maintain our licenses or to receive new licenses when necessary would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to offer online sport betting for NBA games, or at all, is limited in certain jurisdictions due to Fertitta Entertainment, Inc.\u2019s ownership of the Houston Rockets.\nTilman J. Fertitta, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, owns a controlling interest in us. Mr. Fertitta is also the sole shareholder, chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fertitta Entertainment, Inc., which owns the National Basketball Association\u2019s (\u201cNBA\u201d) Houston Rockets. Pursuant to New Jersey law, the direct or indirect legal or beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of a member team of a sport\u2019s governing body shall not place or accept any wager on a sports event in which that member team participates. Accordingly, in the State of New Jersey, we cannot accept wagers on any NBA games in which the Houston Rockets play or have players participating in such games, or on the future performance of any Houston Rockets players, thereby limiting our potential revenues from our online sports betting platform. Michigan\u2019s regulations, once finalized, may result in restrictions similar to those in New Jersey. Illinois regulations, which have been adopted but not yet published in the register, may also include similar restrictions. Pennsylvania currently prohibits any such team owner from operating a sports book and this will prohibit us from engaging in any online sports betting in Pennsylvania. In addition to New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania, online sports betting is legal in eleven other states and the District of Columbia. Under current gaming laws, due to our affiliation with Mr. Fertitta and the Houston Rockets, we expect that we would be unable to obtain a license to conduct our online sports betting operations in Colorado and, if we were able to obtain a license to conduct our online sports betting operations in other states, we would be unable to accept wagers on Houston Rockets games or players in such other states. Further, states that legalize online sports betting in the future may also impose limitations on our ability to obtain a license or accept wagers on certain NBA games, certain NBA players or at all, in each case due to our affiliation with Mr. Fertitta and the Houston Rockets. Moreover, irrespective of jurisdictional limitations, as a condition of Mr. Fertitta\u2019s ownership of the Houston Rockets, the NBA prohibits any gaming entity in which Mr. Fertitta or Fertitta Entertainment, Inc. holds a direct or indirect interest, including us, from accepting any wager on the Houston Rockets, any NBA G League team affiliated with the Houston Rockets, or any game or games involving such team or any player\u2019s individual performance in such game. The existing limitations on our ability to accept certain sports wagers may have an adverse impact on our revenues, business and results of operations, and the potential limitations on our ability to obtain sports betting licenses in the future may have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret, and domain-name-protection laws to protect our rights and the intellectual property that we license from third parties. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our rights, third parties may challenge rights used or held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any of these cases, we may be required to expend\nsignificant time and expense to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. There can be no assurance that others will not offer products or services that are substantially similar to our products or services and compete with our business.\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our right to use intellectual property. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the U.S. or other countries from which our iGaming and online sports betting product offerings or platforms are accessible. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect and enforce our rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our owned or licensed intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business, thereby harming our operating results. Furthermore, if we are unable to protect our rights or prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our offerings and service. Any of these events could seriously harm our business.\nWe may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, credit card issuers and payment processing services providers, which may impair our ability to sell our products and services.\nAlthough financial institutions and payment processors are permitted to provide services to us and others in our industry, banks, credit card issuers and payment processing service providers may be hesitant to offer banking and payment processing services to real money gaming businesses. Consequently, those businesses involved in our industry, including our own, may encounter difficulties in establishing and maintaining banking and payment processing relationships with a full scope of services and generating market rate interest. If we were unable to maintain our bank accounts or our users were unable to use their credit cards, bank accounts or e-wallets to make deposits and withdrawals from our platforms it would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges which could result in an inability to implement our business plan.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are subject to taxation in several jurisdictions and changes in, or new interpretation of, tax laws, tax rulings or their application by tax authorities could result in additional tax liabilities and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur tax obligations are varied and include U.S. federal and state taxes due to the nature of our business. The tax laws applicable to our business are subject to interpretation, and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there will be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof, may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for our provisions, which could cause our results to differ from previous estimates and could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nThe gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue to the jurisdictions in which we operate. Gaming companies and business-to-business providers in the gaming industry (directly and/or indirectly by way of their commercial relationships with operators) are currently subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increases at any time. From time to time, various legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, any worsening of economic conditions and the large number of jurisdictions with significant current or projected budget deficits could intensify the efforts of governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or other taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation or enforcement of such laws. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, tax authorities may impose indirect taxes on Internet-related commercial activity based on existing statutes and regulations which, in some cases, were established prior to the advent of the Internet. Tax authorities may interpret laws originally enacted for mature industries and apply it to newer industries, such as us. The application of\nsuch laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our in-jurisdiction activities may vary from period to period which could result in differences in nexus from period to period.\nWe are subject to periodic review and audit by domestic tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or that we will take, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe that our tax provisions, positions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u25cf tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u25cf costs related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u25cf lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Management and Operations\nWe are subject to risks related to the geographic concentration of our operations.\nAll of GNOG LLC\u2019s revenue prior to 2021 was generated from its online gaming operations in New Jersey. In 2021, we began generating revenues in Michigan and we expect that we will continue to generate substantially all of our revenues in New Jersey and Michigan until such time that we are able to generate a material portion of our revenues from online gaming in other states. Even if our planned launch of online gaming platforms in new markets is successful, our operations will be limited to states where iGaming and online sport betting are legal. Changes to prevailing economic, demographic, competitive, regulatory or any other conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly in New Jersey, could lead to a reduction in demand for our offerings, resulting in a decline in our revenues and, in turn, a material deterioration of our financial condition. Further, our ability to geographically diversify our revenues is limited by the legal status of real money gaming in other jurisdictions. See \u201c- Our growth prospects depend on the legal status of real-money gaming in various jurisdictions and legalization may not occur in as many states as we expect, or may occur at a slower pace than we anticipate. Additionally, even if jurisdictions legalize real money gaming, this may be accompanied by legislative or regulatory restrictions and/or taxes that make it impracticable or less attractive to operate in those jurisdictions, or the process of implementing regulations or securing the necessary licenses to operate in a particular jurisdiction may take longer than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our future results of operations and make it more difficult to meet our expectations for financial performance.\u201d\nWe may be subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses. An adverse outcome in one or more of such proceedings could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our business, we may be subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nIn addition, any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, the posting of bonds requiring significant collateral, letters of credit or similar instruments, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings against us could result in unexpected disciplinary actions, expenses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur continued growth and success will depend on the performance of our current and future employees, including certain key employees. Recruitment and retention of these individuals is vital to growing our business and meeting our business plans. The loss of any of our key executives or other key employees could harm our business. We are dependent on the continued service of our key executives and other key personnel and if we fail to retain such individuals, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on a limited number of key executives and other key personnel to manage and operate our business, including Tilman Fertitta, Michael Harwell and Thomas Winter. The leadership of these key executives and key personnel was a critical element of GNOG LLC\u2019s previous success, and we expect that such leadership will continue to be a critical element of our success in the future. The departure, death or disability of any one of these individuals, or other extended or permanent loss of any of their services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to any of them or their loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, certain of our other employees have made significant contributions to our growth and success. We believe our success and ability to compete and grow will depend in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees and on our ability to retain highly skilled personnel. The competition for these types of personnel is intense and we compete with other potential employers for the services of our employees. As a result, we may not succeed in retaining the executives and other key employees that we need. Employees, particularly analysts and engineers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to attract or retain such highly qualified personnel in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively, and our business could be seriously harmed. In addition, the loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business.\nWe may invest in or acquire other businesses, and our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses or otherwise manage the growth associated with these acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions as opportunities arise to add new or complementary businesses, products, brands or technologies. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial, including as a result of professional fees and due diligence efforts. There is no assurance that the time and resources expended on pursuing acquisitions will result in a completed transaction, or that any completed transaction will ultimately be successful. In addition, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities or may be unable to obtain any required financing or regulatory approvals, and therefore may be unable to complete such\nacquisitions or strategic investments on favorable terms, if at all. We may decide to pursue acquisitions with which our investors may not agree, and we cannot assure investors that any acquisition or investment will be successful or otherwise provide a favorable return on investment. In addition, acquisitions and the integration thereof require significant time and resources and place significant demands on our management, as well as on our operational and financial infrastructure. Furthermore, if we fail to successfully close transactions or integrate new teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into us, our business could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u25cf the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired businesses\u2019 operations, personnel, financial reporting, accounting and internal controls, technologies and products into our business;\n\u25cf increased indebtedness and the expense of integrating acquired businesses, including significant administrative, operational, economic, geographic or cultural challenges in managing and integrating the expanded or combined operations;\n\u25cf entry into jurisdictions or acquisition of products or technologies with which we have limited or no prior experience, and the potential of increased competition with new or existing competitors as a result of such acquisitions;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention and the over-extension of our operating infrastructure and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures, which may be inadequate to support growth;\n\u25cf the ability to fund our capital needs and any cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties; and\n\u25cf the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.\nOur acquisition strategy may not succeed if we are unable to remain attractive to target companies or expeditiously close transactions. Issuing shares of common stock to fund an acquisition may cause economic dilution to existing stockholders. If we develop a reputation for being a difficult acquirer or having an unfavorable work environment, or target companies view our common stock unfavorably, we may be unable to consummate key acquisition transactions essential to our corporate strategy and our business may be materially harmed.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims\nWe maintain insurance that we believe is customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to us may not be made on a timely basis. Such losses could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, from time to time we may be subject to litigation, including potential stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. We do not currently maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance to cover such risk exposure for our directors and officers. Such insurance generally pays the expenses (including amounts paid to plaintiffs, fines and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees) of officers and directors who are the subject of a lawsuit as a result of their service to the company. If we obtain D&O insurance in the future, the amount of D&O insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover such expenses should such a lawsuit occur, and our deductibles may be higher than we may be able to pay. Applicable Delaware law provides for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and agents, under certain circumstances, for attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred by them in\nany litigation to which they become a party resulting from their association with us or activities on our behalf. Without adequate D&O insurance, the amounts we pay to indemnify our officers and directors in connection with their being subject to legal action based on their service to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Further, our lack of D&O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nBecause we have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules under Nasdaq rules, our stockholders do not have certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies and which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nUnder Nasdaq rules, a company in which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company will qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Since Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq rules. As a controlled company, we are not required to comply with certain Nasdaq rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors; (ii) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; (iii) a compensation committee charter which, among other things, provides the compensation committee with the authority and funding to retain compensation consultants and other advisors; and (iv) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board\u2019s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors.\nBecause we have elected to take advantage of the exemptions available to controlled companies, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements under the Nasdaq rules without regard to the exemptions available for \u201ccontrolled companies.\u201d Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nMr. Fertitta and his affiliates may have their interest in us diluted due to future equity issuances or his own actions in selling shares of common stock, in each case, which could result in a loss of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under Nasdaq rules. If this were to happen, we would then be required to comply with those provisions of Nasdaq rules.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with Tilman Fertitta and his affiliates, which limits an investor\u2019s ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nShares of Class B common stock have 10 votes per share, subject to certain adjustments and limitations described elsewhere in this Annual Report, while shares of Class A common stock have one vote per share. Mr. Fertitta, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the indirect owner of all of the equity interests in LF LLC, indirectly holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Accordingly, by virtue of the holdings by Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates, including LF LLC, of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates beneficially own 79.9% of the voting power of our capital stock (as a result of the automatic downward adjustment of Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates\u2019 voting power in accordance with the terms of our Charter), and is able to exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs, including controlling the composition of our board of directors, matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. The directors designated by Mr. Fertitta may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure, including the issuance of additional capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends.\nMr. Fertitta and his affiliates may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. For example, Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates may support certain\nlong-term strategies or objectives for us that may not be accretive to stockholders in the short term. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us, make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates, deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of us, and might ultimately affect the market price of shares of the Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates have registration rights under a registration rights agreement (the \u201cA&R Registration Rights Agreement\u201d). In connection with the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, we entered into the A&R Registration Rights Agreement with the Sponsors, Tilman Fertitta and certain of his affiliates, which provides that the holders of the founder shares or private placement warrants (and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the founder shares or private placement warrants) and holders of Class A common stock issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the A&R HoldCo LLC Agreement are entitled to registration rights. Under the terms of the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, these holders are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities for sale under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). In addition, these holders have \"piggy-back\" registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, JFG Sponsor may not exercise its demand and \"piggyback\" registration rights after five and seven years, respectively after the effective date of the registration statement relating to the IPO and may not exercise its demand rights on more than one occasion. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nFurther, sales of common stock by Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates or the perception that sales may be made by Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates could significantly reduce the market price of shares of Class A common stock. Even if Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates do not sell a large number of common stock into the market, their right to transfer such shares may depress the price of Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the stock price of the Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of the Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indexes. Affected indexes include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which collectively make up the S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on its treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indexes; however, in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities \u201cwith unequal voting structures\u201d in its indexes and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under these policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indexes, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indexes will not be investing in our stock. It continues to be somewhat unclear what effect, if any, these policies will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indexes, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make shares of our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Charter and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our Board to maximize stockholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management, may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a merger or acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a\nproxy contest or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for our securities. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u25cf authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock and preferred stock, which may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans and the existence of which could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise (the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares);\n\u25cf stockholder action by written consent only until the first time when Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of the voting power of our capital stock (the DGCL provides that unless otherwise provided in the Charter, any action of a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting and prior notice by signed written consent of stockholders having the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted);\n\u25cf amendment of our organizational documents only by the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the voting power of our capital stock so long as Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates beneficially own shares representing a majority of the voting power of our capital stock and (ii) at least two-thirds of the voting power of the capital stock from and after the time that Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates cease to beneficially own shares representing a majority of the voting power of our voting stock (the DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, is required to amend a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation, unless the certificate of incorporation requires a greater percentage);\n\u25cf provisions detailing that the number of directors may be fixed and may be modified either (a) by our board of directors or (b) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, depending on the number of shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by Mr. Fertitta and his affiliates at such time;\n\u25cf advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at annual meetings, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock.\nOur Charter includes a forum selection clause, which could discourage claims or limit stockholders\u2019 ability to make a claim against us, our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders.\nOur Charter includes a forum selection clause. Our Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Charter or bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within 10 days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Nonetheless, pursuant to our Charter, the foregoing provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Further, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the\nSecurities Act. Under the Securities Act, federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. This forum selection clause may also discourage claims or limit stockholders\u2019 ability to submit claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce this forum selection clause is low, if a court were to determine the forum selection clause to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA court may find that part or all of the provision included in the Charter pertaining to the automatic transfer right and transfer restrictions with respect to capital stock held by any stockholders who are Unsuitable Persons is not enforceable, either in general or as to a particular fact situation.\nUnder the laws of the State of Delaware, our jurisdiction of incorporation, a corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation for the number of securities that may be owned by any person or group of persons for the purpose of maintaining any statutory or regulatory advantage or complying with any statutory or regulatory requirements under applicable law. Delaware law provides that ownership limitations with respect to shares of our stock issued prior to the effectiveness of our Charter will be effective against (i) stockholders with respect to shares that were voted in favor of the proposed provision and (ii) purported transferees of shares that were voted for the proposed provision if (A) the transfer restrictions are conspicuously noted on the certificate(s) representing such shares or (B) the transferee had actual knowledge of the transfer restrictions (even absent such conspicuous notation). We intend that shares of stock issued after the effectiveness of our Charter will be issued with the ownership limitation conspicuously noted on the certificate(s) representing such shares and therefore under Delaware law such newly issued shares will be subject to the transfer restriction. We also intend to disclose such restrictions to persons holding our stock in uncertificated form.\nWe cannot assure you that the provision pertaining to the automatic transfer right and transfer restrictions with respect to capital stock held by any stockholders who any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us (\u201cUnsuitable Persons\u201d) is enforceable under all circumstances, particularly against stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposed provision, who do not have notice of the ownership limitations at the time they subsequently acquire their shares, or who acquire shares that were owned, at the time of the vote on the proposed provision, by a stockholder (or stockholders) who did not vote such shares in favor of the proposed provision. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we would be able to redeem the shares of a stockholder deemed an Unsuitable Person by applicable regulatory authorities.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if, the market value of Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our\nsecurities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is either not an emerging growth company or an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAdditionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nDuring the audit of GNOG LLC\u2019s 2019 financial statements, its management determined that it had a material weakness related to the computation of its provision for income taxes. In response to this finding, GNOG LLC changed its internal control processes regarding the provision for income tax computation and retained third-party tax advisors to review these computations. In 2020, GNOG LLC\u2019s management believed it had taken the appropriate measure to remediate this material weakness.\nAs a private company, GNOG LLC was not required to maintain disclosure controls or document and test its internal control over financial reporting. Further, GNOG LLC\u2019s management was not required to certify the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and its auditors were not required to opine on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Similarly, as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d Landcadia II was exempt from the SEC\u2019s internal control reporting requirements. If and when we lose our emerging growth company status and when we become subject to the SEC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting management and auditor attestation requirements, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. See \u201c-We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies\u201d above.\nIn addition, subsequent to the issuance of our 2020 consolidated financial statements, our management determined there was an error related to the accounting treatment of the warrants previously issued. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe developed and implemented the remediation of this material weakness to address the restatement noted above to improve the process and controls in the determination of the appropriate accounting and classification of our financial instruments and key agreements.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, or if our internal controls have material weaknesses, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC, could be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our Class A common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, increase the risk of liability arising from litigation based on securities law, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock in the public market (including shares of Class A common stock issuable in connection with the exercise of our warrants), or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOur sponsors and Mr. Fertitta entered into a letter agreement with us, which was amended by lock-up amendment upon the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, pursuant to which they have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earliest of (A) one year after the closing of the Acquisition Transaction or (B) subsequent to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, (x) if the last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, (y) if the last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 60 days after the closing of the Acquisition Transaction or (z) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company\u2019s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nIn addition, we have reserved a total of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under our Incentive Plan. Any shares of Class A common stock that we issue under our Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors. As the lock-up restrictions on the shares of our Class A common stock and other restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their sale, exchange or registration rights and sell shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell shares, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could drop significantly. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities.\nFurthermore, we have issued and outstanding warrants to purchase 5,883,333 shares of Class A common stock. The additional shares of Class A common stock issued upon exercise of our warrants will result in dilution to then existing holders of our common stock and will increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities. In particular, the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition, or to raise additional equity capital, could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Any such issuance of additional securities in the future may result in additional dilution to you or may adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nWe may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject. Accordingly, a stockholder could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock and warrants may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf success of competitors;\n\u25cf our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the market in general;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the volume of shares of common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf any major change in the Board or management;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nThe coverage of our business or our securities by securities or industry analysts or the absence thereof could adversely affect our securities and trading volume.\nThe trading market for our securities is influenced in part by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business or industry from time to time. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. As a former shell company, we may be slow to attract equity research coverage, and the analysts who publish information about our securities will have had relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If no or few analysts commence equity research coverage of us, the trading price and volume of our securities would likely be negatively impacted. If analysts do cover us and one or more of them downgrade our securities, or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or inaccurate research, our stock price would likely decline. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets. Any of the foregoing would likely cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe exercise of warrants for our Class A common stock would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had warrants issued and outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 5,883,333 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. All of our Public Warrants were exercised or redeemed as of March 8, 2021. To the extent remaining private placement warrants are exercised, additional shares of Class A common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then-existing holders of Class A common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe valuation of our warrants could increase the volatility in our net income (loss) in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d)\u201d (the \u201cSEC Statement\u201d). Specifically, the SEC Statement focused on certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers following a business combination, which terms are similar to those contained in the warrant agreement governing our warrants. As a result of the SEC Statement, we reevaluated the accounting treatment of our 10,541,667 public warrants and 5,883,333 private placement warrants which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and determined to classify the warrants as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings.\nAs a result, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 contained elsewhere in this Annual Report are derivative liabilities related to embedded features contained within our warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\u201cASC 815\u201d), provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our consolidated financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors, which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Landcadia HoldCo, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions made by Landcadia HoldCo to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in Landcadia HoldCo. As a result, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. Our ability to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreement we entered into with LF LLC in connection with the closing of the Acquisition Transaction (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d) and pay dividends will depend on the financial results and cash flows of Landcadia HoldCo and its subsidiaries and the distributions we receive from Landcadia HoldCo. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of Landcadia HoldCo and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and Landcadia HoldCo and/or any of its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, including the Credit Agreement, or Landcadia HoldCo is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nLandcadia HoldCo is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its membership interests. Accordingly, we will be required to pay income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Landcadia HoldCo. Under the terms of the A&R HoldCo LLC Agreement, Landcadia HoldCo generally is obligated to make tax distributions to the members of Landcadia HoldCo (including us) calculated at certain assumed tax rates. In addition to income taxes, we incur expenses related to our operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant. In general, we intend to cause Landcadia HoldCo to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to holders of its membership interests on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by us. However, as discussed below, Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of Landcadia HoldCo and its subsidiaries and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained in Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Landcadia HoldCo insolvent.\nAdditionally, although Landcadia HoldCo generally will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax, it may be liable under U.S. federal tax law for adjustments to its tax return, absent an election to the contrary. In the event Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s calculations of taxable income are incorrect, Landcadia HoldCo and/or its members, including us, in later years may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this federal law and its related guidance.\nDividends on Class A common stock, if any, will be paid at the discretion of the Board, which will consider, among other things, our available cash, available borrowings and other funds legally available therefor, taking into account the retention of any amounts necessary to satisfy our obligations that will not be reimbursed by Landcadia HoldCo, including taxes and amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement and any restrictions in then applicable bank financing agreements. Financing arrangements may also include restrictive covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders. In addition, Landcadia HoldCo generally is prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Landcadia HoldCo (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Landcadia\nHoldCo\u2019s subsidiaries generally are subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to Landcadia HoldCo. Further, the Credit Agreement will limit the ability of GNOG LLC to make distributions to Landcadia HoldCo. If Landcadia HoldCo does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement requires that we make cash payments to LF LLC for certain tax benefits we may realize in the future, and these payments could be substantial and could be accelerated upon certain events, including a change of control.\nIn general, beginning 180 days after the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, LF LLC may exchange HoldCo Class B Units for shares of Class A common stock or, at our election, in our capacity as the sole managing member of Landcadia HoldCo, cash, pursuant to the A&R HoldCo LLC Agreement. These exchanges, certain actual or deemed distributions from Landcadia HoldCo to LF LLC, and certain other transactions may result in increases in our pro rata share of the tax basis of Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s assets that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis may increase (for certain income tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions allocable to us and therefore reduce the amount of income tax attributable to Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s operations that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future and also may decrease gain (or increase loss) otherwise allocable to us from Landcadia HoldCo on future dispositions of certain of Landcadia HoldCo\u2019s assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. The IRS may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases and tax benefits and no assurances can be made regarding the availability of these tax basis increases or other tax benefits.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to LF LLC in respect of 85% of the U.S. federal, state and local income tax savings allocable to us from Landcadia HoldCo and arising from certain transactions, including (a) certain transactions contemplated under the Purchase Agreement and (b) the exchange of LF LLC\u2019s Class B membership interests of Landcadia HoldCo (the \u201cHoldCo Class B Units\u201d) for Class A common stock, as determined on a \u201cwith and without\u201d basis, and for an early termination payment by us to LF LLC in the event of a termination with a majority vote of disinterested directors, a material breach of a material obligation, or a change of control, subject to certain limitations, including in connection with available cash flow and financing facilities. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of our control, we expect that the payments we will make will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon a change of control or other acceleration event. Furthermore, our obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Under certain circumstances, non-payment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as further described below. The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of us and not of Landcadia HoldCo. Actual tax benefits realized by us may differ from the tax benefits calculated pursuant to the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may exceed the actual tax benefits we realize or may be accelerated.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of the certain deductions or tax basis increases, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us are disallowed, LF LLC will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to LF LLC will be netted against any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us, if any, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or,\neven if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments against which to net. As a result, in certain circumstances, we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual U.S. federal, state and local income tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nMoreover, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in certain circumstances, including certain changes of control, a material breach of a material obligation, and a termination at the election of the majority of our disinterested directors, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will accelerate and we generally will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to LF LLC equal to the present value of certain future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The lump-sum payment could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we realize subsequent to such payment.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual U.S. federal, state and local income tax savings that we realize. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.", "PERMNO": 18778, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "LCA"}
