RISK FACTORS\nAdditional Risk Factors to Consider:\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are the material risks of which we are currently aware; however, they may not be the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business. If any of these risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nSatisfying closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the Merger\nOn February 28, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with RF1 Holding Company (\u201cParent\u201d) and RF Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with API surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon certain closing conditions, and if such closing conditions are not met, the Merger will not be consummated.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the price of API common stock and future business and operations could be harmed\nThere is no assurance that the Merger will be effected. If the Merger is not completed, we may be subject to the following material risks, among others:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive merger consideration than the consideration offered by ;\n\u2022\nthe price of API common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of API common stock reflects a higher price than it otherwise would have based on the assumption, among others, that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\ncertain of our costs related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed;\n\u2022\nwe would not realize the benefits it expects from the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from our day-to-day business and the unavoidable disruption to its employees and its relationships with clients as a result of efforts and uncertainties relating to the Merger may detract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs, which, in turn may lead to a loss of market position that we could be unable to regain if the Merger does not occur;\n\u2022\nunder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which may affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue our present level of operations, may need to scale back our business and may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nShareholders may sell substantial amounts of API common stock in the public market, which is likely to depress the price of API common stock\nA significant number of our shares of common stock may be sold at any time prior to the Merger. If our current shareholders sell API common stock in the public market prior to the Merger, it is likely that arbitrageurs\nwill acquire such shares. These arbitrageurs would likely sell all such shares in the public market immediately following any announcement, or anticipated announcement, that the Merger failed, or will likely fail, to close, which in turn would likely cause the market price of API common stock to decline. In addition to the other negative effects on the Company, such sales of API common stock might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future if the Merger is not completed.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial charges associated with the Merger; we cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges\nOther Merger related costs yet to be incurred, such as potential litigation costs related to the Merger and additional legal, accounting and certain investment banking fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed. Under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $3.5 million.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are highly reliant on defense spending\nOur current orders from defense-related companies account for a material portion of our overall net sales and defense spending levels depend on factors that are outside of our control. For each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, U.S. defense revenue represented approximately 45% and 45%, respectively, of our total consolidated sales. Reductions or changes in defense spending, including as a result of new U.S. government budget reductions, could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profits. The loss or significant curtailment of government contracts or subcontracts, or failure to exercise renewal options or enter into new contracts or subcontracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in federal government spending could directly affect our financial performance. Among the factors that could impact federal government spending and which would reduce our federal government contracting and subcontracting business are a significant decline in, or reapportioning of, spending by the federal government, changes or cancellations of federal government programs or requirements, and shutdowns or other delays in the government appropriations process. In addition, a difference in philosophy or the worsening economic climate of the country could reduce or change appropriations.\nThe current administration and Congress are under increasing pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit. This could result in a general decline in U.S. defense spending and could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, exercise their rights to terminate contracts in whole or in part, to issue temporary stop work orders or decline to exercise options to renew contracts, all of which could harm our operations and significantly reduce our future revenues.\nIn particular, military spending may be negatively impacted by the Budget Control Act of 2011, or the Budget Control Act, which was passed in August 2011. The Budget Control Act established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years, and also provided that the defense budget would face \u201csequestration\u201d cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits were exceeded. The impact of sequestration was reduced with respect to the government\u2019s 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, in exchange for extending sequestration into fiscal years 2022 and 2023, following the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 in December 2013. The impact of sequestration was further reduced with respect to the government\u2019s 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, following the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015. Sequestration is currently scheduled to resume in the government\u2019s 2018 fiscal year. We are unable to predict the impact the cuts associated with Sequestration will ultimately have on funding for the military programs which we support. However, such cuts could result in reductions, delays or cancellations of these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The debt ceiling continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. As a result of the Budget Act and deficit reduction pressures, it appears likely that discretionary spending by the federal government may remain constrained for several years.\nSuch occurrences are beyond our control. For instance, government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the beginning of a major program, a contract is typically only partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years. Also, the specific programs in which we participate, or in which we may seek to participate in the future, must compete with other programs for consideration during the budget formulation and appropriation processes.\nWe are subject to unique business risks as a result of supplying products to the U.S. government directly and as a subcontractor, which could lead to a reduction in our net sales from, or the profitability of our arrangements with, the U.S. Government\nCompanies engaged in supplying defense-related products to U.S. government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. We contract directly with the U.S. government and as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the U.S. government. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally suspend or prohibit us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations, reduce the value of existing contracts and audit our contract- related costs and fees. In addition, most of our U.S. and international government contracts and subcontracts can be terminated by the U.S. or foreign government or the contracting party, as applicable, at its convenience. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.\nIn addition, the U.S. government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d Such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business. As a result of such a review, we could be required to provide a refund to the U.S. government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the DoD could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts. Any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our net sales from, or the profitability of certain of our arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. government.\nOur business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions\nThe continuing turmoil in the global economy and, in the U.S., the Congressional deadlock over the federal debt ceiling and government spending restrictions, has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. Specific risk factors related to these overall economic and credit conditions include the following: customer or potential customers may reduce or delay their procurement or new product development; key suppliers may become insolvent resulting in delays for our material purchases; vendors and other third parties may fail to perform their contractual obligations; customers may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; and certain customers may become insolvent. These risk factors could reduce our product sales, increase our operating costs, impact our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables, lengthen our cash conversion cycle and increase our need for cash, which would ultimately decrease our profitability and negatively impact our financial condition. In addition, defense budgets generally are under pressure. Reduced defense spending may affect products purchased by those governments or their prime contractors from us and may materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are reliant on certain security clearances for some of our business\nWe have Facility Security Clearances from the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office, which is part of the Defense Security Service, or DSS, for several of our U.S. facilities and comparable clearances at several of our U.K. and Canadian facilities. If we do not maintain the Facility Security Clearances we would be prevented from continuing those business activities that require access to classified information. Our ability to maintain our Facility Security Clearances has a direct impact on our ability to bid on or win new contracts, complete existing contracts, or effectively re-bid on expiring contracts either directly through the U.S. government or through U.S. defense contractors. The inability to obtain and maintain our Facility Security Clearances would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe currently maintain approximately $200.0 million of debt and our failure to service such indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities\nAt February 1, 2016, we had approximately $200.0 million (November 30, 2015 - $200.0 million), in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt, which was secured by substantially all of our assets.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to refinance our existing debt depends on our future financial performance as well as our ability to access the capital markets, and the relative attractiveness of available financing terms. We do not have complete control over our future financial performance because it is subject to economic, political, financial (including credit market conditions), competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting the aerospace and defense industry, as well as commercial industries in which we operate. It is possible that in the future our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If this situation occurs, we may have to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms in accordance with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to us. These consequences may include:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our net cash flow from operations to be used to pay interest and principal on our debt and therefore be unavailable for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, paying dividends to our shareholders, repurchasing shares of our common stock, research and development and other investments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, investments or other expenditures, which, in each case, may limit our ability to introduce new technologies and products or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nheightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in the general economy and restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new technologies and products or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our organic growth and ability to hire additional personnel.\nOur credit facilities contain certain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business\nOur credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that affect our business and restrict our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, issue guarantees, grant liens, dispose of assets and pay dividends or make distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, as a result of the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit facilities, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to make capital expenditures or raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities either through acquisitions or internal expansion. The terms of any future indebtedness could include more restrictive covenants.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the appropriate parties and/or amend the covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. If we are not able to comply with all of these covenants for any reason and we have debt outstanding at the time of such failure, some or all of our outstanding debt could become due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under the credit facilities would not be allowed. If our cash is utilized to repay any outstanding debt, depending on the amount of debt outstanding, we could experience an immediate and significant reduction in working capital available to operate our business.\nNet sales could decline significantly if we lose a major customer or a major program\nHistorically, a large portion of our net sales have been derived from sales to a small number of our customers and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. The U.S., U.K. and Canadian governments\u2019 Departments of Defense (directly and through subcontractors) account for approximately, 45%, 10% and 1%, respectively, of our revenues for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, and 45% and 9% and 2%, respectively, of our revenues for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014. Two of our U.S. customers, one a defense prime contractor, represented approximately 15% of revenues for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 and 12% of revenues for the year ended November 30, 2014. A loss of a significant customer could materially adversely impact the future operations of our Company.\nIn many cases, our customers are not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue the purchase of our products at any time. In the event one or more of our major customers reduces, delays or cancels orders with us, and we are not able to sell our products to new customers at comparable levels, our net sales could decline significantly, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers would negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws, regulations and restrictions, and failure to comply with these laws, regulations and restrictions could subject us to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment\nOur contracts and operations are subject to various laws and regulations. Prime contracts with various agencies of the U.S. government, and subcontracts with other prime contractors, are subject to numerous procurement regulations, including Federal Acquisition Regulation and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines, penalties, debarment, or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all U.S. government agencies. We are also subject to the federal False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties and treble damages where a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share in any recovery). Given our dependence on U.S. government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, our international business subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Changes in regulations or political environments may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in certain liabilities and could possibly result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe possibility of goodwill impairment exists\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, including SenDEC, Spectrum, CMT, RTIE, C-MAC, Inmet and Weinschel, goodwill is a significant part of our total assets. At November 30, 2015, our total assets were approximately $345.0 million, which included approximately $149.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill reflects the excess of the purchase price of each of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets of the business acquired. We perform annual evaluations, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, for potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with current accounting standards. We wrote down goodwill by $107.5 million in fiscal 2012, primarily from our EMS segment.\nMajor factors that influence our analyses of fair value are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the reporting units. Other factors considered in our fair value calculations include assumptions as to the business climate, industry and economic conditions. These assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our analyses. While management, based on current forecasts and outlooks, believes that the assumptions and estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurances that future actual operating results will be realized as planned and that there will not be additional material impairment charges as a result. Any write-down of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss and those decreases or increases could be material.\nThe concentration of our share ownership among our current officers, directors and their affiliates may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters\nOur officers and directors as a group beneficially own a large percentage of our shares. Therefore, directors and officers, acting together may have a controlling influence on (i) matters submitted to our shareholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) and (ii) our management and affairs. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nWe have a history of net losses, and may not be profitable in the future\nPrior to the six-month transition period ended November 30, 2011, we incurred net losses for each of the five fiscal years preceding the transition period and incurred a loss in our past four fiscal years. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Even if we achieve profitability, we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and we may incur net losses from period to period. The impact of the foregoing may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which may result in a decrease in the market value of our common shares.\nThe integration of acquisitions may be difficult and may not yield the expected results\nAs part of our general business strategy, we have experienced significant growth due to acquisitions. Failure to manage this growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Expansion will place significant demands on our marketing, sales, administrative, operational, financial and management information systems, controls and procedures. Accordingly, our performance and profitability will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to (i) manage our business and our subsidiaries as a cohesive enterprise, (ii) manage expansion through the timely implementation and maintenance of appropriate administrative, operational, financial and management information systems, controls and procedures, (iii) add internal capacity, facilities and third-party sourcing arrangements as and when needed, (iv) maintain product and service quality controls, and (v) attract, train, retain, motivate and manage effectively our employees. There can be no assurance that our systems, controls, procedures, facilities and personnel, even if\nsuccessfully integrated, will be adequate to support our projected future operations. Any failure to maintain such systems, controls and procedures, add internal capacity, facilities and third-party sourcing arrangements or attract, train, retain, motivate and manage effectively our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Ultimately, acquisitions may not be as profitable as expected or profitable at all.\nSome of the additional risks that may continue to affect integration of our acquired companies include those associated with:\n\u2022\nconsolidating and integrating operations and space, and the costs and risks associated therewith;\n\u2022\nretaining customers and contracts from the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u2022\nimplementing the controls and procedures and policies appropriate for a public company to any acquired company that prior to their acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies.\nFor certain acquisitions, we have raised the capital required to make such acquisitions from the issuance of shares, warrants, and convertible debt, which has been dilutive to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, in the period following an acquisition, we are required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. When such assets are found to be impaired, they are written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.\nPending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and could adversely affect our business\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. In connection with claims or litigation, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe may require additional financing which we may not be able to obtain; Our shareholders may suffer dilution\nWe expect that we will require additional financing in order to support expansion, develop new or enhanced services or products, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies, repay debt, or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities. Our ability to arrange such financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions, as well as our business performance. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing under satisfactory terms. If additional financing is raised by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, our shareholders may suffer dilution. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures and remain in business.\nOur inability to retain and attract employees with key technical or operational expertise may adversely affect our business\nThe products that we sell require a large amount of engineering design, manufacturing and operational expertise. However, the majority of our technological capabilities are not protected by patents and licenses. We rely on the expertise of our employees and our learned experiences in both the design and manufacture of our products. Competition for personnel in our industry is intense and there are a limited number of persons,\nespecially engineers, with knowledge of and experience in our technologies. Our design and development efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel. An inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance or on our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. In addition, if we were to lose one or more of our key employees, then we would likely lose some portion of our institutional knowledge and technical know-how, which could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect our business\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in this Annual Report and each of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, a report containing our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future. We have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, but not limited to, the engagement of consultants, the documentation of existing controls and the implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate.\nWe continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on key personnel\nWe are dependent upon a small number of key personnel. The loss of the services of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because we believe our success will depend in large part on the efforts of these individuals. While we have entered into employment letter agreements with certain key personnel, such letter agreements provide that their employment is at-will. We do not currently have, or propose to have, any long-term employment agreements with key personnel, nor do we intend to obtain key-man insurance in respect of such key personnel.\nThe defense, semiconductor and electronic components industries are highly competitive and increased competition could adversely affect our operating results\nThe areas of the defense, semiconductor and electronic component industries in which we do business are highly competitive. We expect intensified competition from existing competitors and new entrants. Competition is based on price, product performance, product availability, quality, reliability and customer service. Even in strong markets, pricing pressures may emerge. For instance, competitors may attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices. The market for commercial products is characterized by declining selling prices. We anticipate that average selling prices for our products will continue to decrease in future periods, although the timing and amount of these decreases cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. We compete in various markets with companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may be better able to pursue acquisition opportunities and to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future and such competitive pressures may harm our financial condition and/or operating results.\nWe are required to comply with the \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, which will impose costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks\nAs required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, in August 2012, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d\nwhich are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding manufacturers\u2019 efforts to discover the origin of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. These conflict minerals are commonly referred to as \u201c3TG\u201d and include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. The conflict minerals rules required us to engage in due diligence efforts for the 2013 calendar year and such efforts are ongoing. Disclosures are required no later than May 31 of each year. We have, and we expect that we will continue to, incur additional costs and expenses, which may be significant in order to comply with these rules, including for (i) due diligence to determine whether conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of any of our products and, if so, verify the sources of such conflict minerals; and (ii) any changes that we may desire to make to our products, processes, or sources of supply as a result of such diligence and verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, ultimately we may not be able to sufficiently discover the origin of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may adversely affect our reputation with our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of our products are certified as conflict mineral free. If we are not able to meet such requirements, customers may choose not to purchase our products, which could adversely affect our sales and the value of portions of our inventory. Further, there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free minerals and, as a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain metals, if necessary, from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Any one or a combination of these various factors could harm our business, reduce market demand for our products, and adversely affect our profit margins, net sales, and overall financial results.\nWe depend on limited suppliers for certain critical raw materials\nOur manufacturing operations require raw materials that must meet exacting standards. Additionally, certain customers require us to buy from particular vendors due to their product specifications. We rely heavily on our ability to maintain access to steady sources of these raw materials at favorable prices. We do not have specific long-term contractual arrangements, but we believe we are on good terms with our suppliers. We cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to our current sources of supply at favorable prices, or at all, or that we will not encounter supply problems in the future. Any interruption in our supply of raw materials could reduce our sales in a given period, and possibly cause a loss of business to a competitor, if we could not reschedule the deliveries of our product to our customers. In addition, our gross profits could suffer if the prices for raw materials increase, especially with respect to sales associated with military contracts where prices are typically fixed.\nPrecious metals are subject to price fluctuations\nRaw materials used in the manufacture of certain ceramic capacitors include silver, palladium, and platinum. Certain of our microwave components and systems require gold plating. Precious metals are available from many sources; however, their prices may be subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. Historically, the Company has been able to pass on precious metal price increase to its customers, in the form of precious metal price adders or direct sales price increases. However, there can be no assurance that customers will continue to accept these selling price adjustments and, as a result, there may be a material adverse effect on our operating margins and overall operating results.\nWe may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand\nThe industries in which we operate are dynamic and constantly evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner, or those products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales. The success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors, including:\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient completion of process design and development;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes;\n\u2022\nproduct performance;\n\u2022\nthe quality and reliability of the product;\n\u2022\neffective marketing, sales and customer service; and\n\u2022\nsufficient demand for the product at an acceptable price.\nThe failure of our products to achieve market acceptance due to these or other factors could harm our business.\nCancellation or changes or delays in orders could materially reduce our net sales and operating results\nWe generally do not receive firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations for a period by reducing our net sales in that period. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross profit and operating income.\nOur lengthy sales cycle may increase the likelihood that our quarterly net sales will fluctuate which may adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock\nDue to the complexity of our technology and the types of end uses for our products, our customers perform, and require us to perform, extensive process and product evaluation and testing, which results in a lengthy sales cycle. Our sales cycles can often last for several months, and may last for up to a year or more. Additionally, as we are a tier three supplier, our orders are dependent on funding and contract negotiations through multiple parties which can affect our receipt of orders due to matters outside of our control. Our business is moving towards a business base driven more by larger orders on major defense programs. As a result of these factors, our net sales and operating results may vary unpredictably from period to period. This fact makes it more difficult to forecast our quarterly results and can cause substantial variations in operating results from quarter to quarter that are unrelated to the long-term trends in our business. This lack of predictability in our results could adversely affect the market price of our common shares in particular periods.\nWe depend on military prime contractors for the sale of our products\nWe sell a substantial portion of our products to military prime contractors and the contract manufacturers who work for them. The timing and amount of sales to these customers ultimately depend on sales levels and shipping schedules for the products into which our components are incorporated. We have no control over the volume and timing of products shipped by our military prime contractors and the contract manufacturers who work for them, and we cannot be certain that our military prime contractors or the contract manufacturers who work for them will continue to ship products that incorporate our components at current levels, or at all. Our business will be harmed if our military prime contractors or the contract manufacturers who work for them fail to achieve significant sales of products incorporating our components or if fluctuations in the timing or reductions in the volume of such sales occur. Failure of these customers to inform us of changes in their production needs in a timely manner could also hinder our ability to effectively manage our business.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. government laws, regulations and manufacturing facility certifications would reduce our ability to be awarded future military business\nWe must comply with laws, regulations and certifications relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts as passed down to us by our customers in their purchase orders, which affects our military business and may impose added cost on our business. We are subject to government audits and reviews of our accounting procedures, business practices, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. We also could be subject to an investigation as a result of private party whistleblower lawsuits. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. If a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including the termination of our contracts, the forfeiture of profits, the suspension of payments owed to us, fines, and our suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies. In addition, we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and incur damages, fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements. Since defense sales account for a significant portion of our business, any debarment or suspension of our ability to obtain military sales would greatly reduce our overall net sales and profits, and would likely affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur products may be found to be defective, product liability claims may be asserted against us and we may not have sufficient liability insurance\nOne or more of our products may be found to be defective after shipment, requiring a product replacement, recall or repair which would cure the defect but impede performance of the product. We may also be subject to product returns, which could impose substantial costs and harm to our business.\nProduct liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products. Although we currently have insurance, there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage, that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance, or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims.\nWe typically provide a one-year product defect warranty from the date of sale. Historically, warranty costs have been nominal and have been within management\u2019s expectations. We continually assess the necessity for a warranty provision and accrue amounts deemed necessary.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights or our infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business\nWe principally rely on our skill in the manufacture of our products and not on any proprietary technologies that we develop or license on an exclusive basis. Our manufacturing know-how is primarily embodied in our drawings and specifications, and information about the manufacture of these products purchased from others. Our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain licenses of certain proprietary technologies used in principal products from the original manufacturers of such products. Our reliance upon protection of some of our production technology as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d will not necessarily protect us from other parties independently obtaining the ability to manufacture our products. In addition, there may be circumstances in which \u201cknow how\u201d is not documented, but exists within the heads of various employees who may leave the Company or disclose our know how to third parties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our production technology, dissemination of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPatents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products. Our major competitors as well as other third parties may obtain and may have obtained patents related to the types of products we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products. In addition, some patent applications in the U.S. are\nconfidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which technology concerning our products may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. In general, if one or more of our products were found by a court to infringe patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products, to obtain licenses to develop and market the products from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products in such a way as to avoid infringing those patents. An adverse ruling arising out of any intellectual property dispute could also subject us to significant liability for damages.\nWe cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such license would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, and are unable to redesign our products to avoid infringement of any such patents, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAlso, we hold various patents and licenses relating to certain of our products. We cannot assure you as to the breadth or degree of protection that existing or future patents, if any, may afford us, that our patents will be upheld, if challenged, or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any patent issued to us. It is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid. We may have to expend resources to protect our patents in the event a third party infringes our patents, although we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to prosecute all or any patent violations by third parties.\nWe must commit resources to product manufacturing prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment\nWe sell many of our products pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. This makes long-term planning difficult. Further, many of these purchase orders may be revised or canceled prior to shipment without penalty. As a result, we must commit resources to the production of products without advance purchase commitments from customers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in our holding excess or obsolete inventory. This could cause inventory write-downs. Our inability to sell products after we have devoted significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVariability of our manufacturing yields may affect our gross margins\nOur manufacturing yields vary significantly among products, depending on the complexity of a particular product. The difficulties that may be experienced in the production process include: defects in subcontractors components, impurities in the materials used, equipment failure, and unreliability of a subcontractor. From time to time, we have experienced difficulties in achieving planned yields, which have adversely affected our gross margins. Yield decreases can result in substantially higher unit costs, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and have done so in the past. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to improve yields in the future or that we will not suffer periodic yield problems, particularly during the early production of new products or introduction of new process technologies. In either case, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inventories may become obsolete\nThe life cycles of some of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products into which these products are designed. Products with short life cycles require us to manage closely our production and inventory levels. Inventory may also become obsolete. The life cycles for electronic components have been shortening over time at an accelerated pace. We may be adversely affected in the future by obsolete or excess inventories which may result from unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed.\nInterruptions, delays or cost increases affecting our materials, parts, equipment or subcontractors may impair our competitive position\nSome of our product are sometimes tested and plated using a third-party test and plating house. We do not have any long-term agreements with these subcontractors. As a result, we may not have assured control over our product delivery schedules or product quality. Due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to assemble or test them. Any product delivery delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors is disrupted or terminated.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely impact our financial position\nU.S., U.K., and Canadian laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes or in our finished goods. Under environmental regulations, we are responsible for determining whether certain toxic metals or chemicals are present in any given components we purchase and in each product we sell. These environmental regulations have required us to expend a portion of our resources and capital on relevant compliance programs. In addition, under other laws and regulations, we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our current or former properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if we did not cause the contamination. Also, we may be subject to additional common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties. Further, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future. Any failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to significant liabilities and could have material adverse effects on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the conduct of our manufacturing operations, we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under applicable laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, we operate or own facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. These properties were used in ways that may have involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from, or within or through any such property. These risks may give rise to claims. Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon us jointly with third parties under environmental laws and regulations.\nRisks Relating to Our Shares of Common Stock\nOur stock market price and trading volume is volatile\nThe market for our common stock is volatile. Our share price is subject to volatility in both price and volume arising from market expectations, announcements and press releases regarding our business, and changes in estimates and evaluations by securities analysts or other events or factors.\nOver the years, the securities markets in the U.S. have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies, particularly smaller-capitalization companies like us, have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values, or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock are subject to significant volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. Further, the market for our common stock has been very thin. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to sell significant quantities of common stock in the public trading markets without a significant reduction in the price of our common shares.\nShareholders may experience dilution if a significant proportion of our outstanding options are exercised\nBecause our success is highly dependent upon our employees, directors and consultants, we have and intend in the future to grant to some or all of our key employees, directors and consultants options to purchase shares of our Common Stock as non-cash incentives. We have adopted an equity incentive plan for this purpose. To the extent that significant numbers of such options may be exercised when the exercise price is below the then current market price for our common shares, the interests of the other shareholders of the company may be diluted. As of November 30, 2015, we have outstanding options to purchase 2,002,627 shares of Common Stock that were granted to directors, officers, employees and consultants that have a weighted average price of $3.62 and 278,381 restricted stock units.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends\nWe intend to invest all available funds to finance our growth and/or pay down debt. Therefore our shareholders cannot expect to receive any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. Even if we were to determine that a dividend could be declared, we could be precluded from paying dividends by restrictive provisions of loans, leases or other agreements or by legal prohibitions under applicable corporate law.\nOur failure to comply with The NASDAQ Stock Market\u2019s continued listing standards may adversely affect the price and liquidity of our shares of common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future\nOur common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on June 27, 2011, under the symbol ATNY. Until we became listed on NASDAQ, our common stock was quoted and traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. NASDAQ requires listed companies to maintain minimum financial thresholds and comply with certain corporate governance regulations to remain listed. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining compliance with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, then our common stock could be delisted and may trade only in the secondary markets such as OTC Bulletin Board. Delisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect our liquidity and price of our common stock as well as our ability to raise capital in the future.", "PERMNO": 12881, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ATNY"}
