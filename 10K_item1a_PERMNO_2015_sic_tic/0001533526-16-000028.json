{"cik": "1533526", "company": "GLOBAL BRASS & COPPER HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are exposed to various risks as we operate our businesses. To provide a framework to understand our operating environment of the Company, we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses. Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected by downturns in economic cycles in general or cyclicality in our markets, both inside and outside of the U.S. Our future growth also depends, to a significant extent, on improvements in general economic conditions and in conditions in our markets.\nMany of our products are used in industries that are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns due to factors such as economic conditions, energy prices, the availability of credit, consumer sentiment, demand and other factors beyond our control. These economic and industry downturns have resulted in diminished product demand and excess capacity for our products. The significant deterioration in economic conditions that occurred during the second half of 2008 and continued into 2009 resulted in disruptions in a number of our markets. Any future economic disruptions may negatively impact our markets or the consumers served by those markets, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nFuture disruptions in the commercial credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market, and we are not able to predict the impact any such worsening conditions would have on our customers in general, and our results of operations specifically. Businesses in one or more of the markets that we serve, or consumers in one or more of the markets that our customers serve, may postpone or choose not to make purchases in response to economic uncertainty, tighter credit, negative financial news, unemployment, interest rates, adverse consumer sentiment and declines in housing prices or other asset values.\nA significant amount of our volume is tied to the building and housing sector. If the housing, remodeling and residential and commercial construction markets stagnate or deteriorate, demand from such markets for our products, especially our brass rod products, is likely to be adversely affected. Any recovery in such markets will not necessarily directly correlate with increased sales or profitability. Our key products are typically installed late in the housing construction cycle, meaning there is an inherent lag in volumes, and sales of our building and housing products can be affected by factors such as housing mix (unit size, unit price point and the mix of multi-family versus single-family construction). Sales of our products can also be impacted by the actual timing of housing starts and completions as well as to changes in the materials and fixtures used in construction that may contain fewer copper products or materials and fixtures than were used in the past. In addition, competition from imports and other sources may also dampen the effects of any such recovery on our results of operations.\nSimilarly, the automotive market has in the past experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. Demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit and the cost of fuel. Negative economic developments could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing our customers to reduce their vehicle and automotive component part production in North America.\nThe coinage and general consumer markets are also affected by economic cycles. Demand for coinage-related products generally increases with the number of cash transactions that occur, and the number of cash transactions generally increases during periods of economic growth. Demand for consumer goods is also very sensitive to economic conditions and drives demand in our electronics / electrical components market.\nThe munitions market is cyclical and is not correlated to any general economic indicators and thus, has a high degree of volatility.\nAs a result, cyclicality in economic conditions and in the markets that we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our growth prospects also depend, to a significant extent, on the degree by which general economic conditions and conditions in the markets that we serve continue to improve.\nFailure to maintain our balanced book approach would cause increased volatility in our profitability and our operating results and may result in significant losses.\nCopper scrap and cathode are subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations. The availability and price of copper scrap and cathode depend on a number of factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, international demand for metal and internal recycling activities by primary copper producers and other consumers of copper. The cost of copper scrap and cathode represents the largest component of our cost of sales.\nWe use our balanced book approach to substantially reduce the impact of metal price movements on operating margins from our non-toll sales, which are sales for which we assume responsibility for metal procurement and then recover the metal replacement cost from the customer. Non-toll sales represented approximately 75% of our unit sales volume over the last three years. Under our balanced book approach, we seek to match the timing, quantity and price of the metal component of net sales with the timing, quantity and price of replacement metal purchases on all of our non-toll sales. We use a combination of matching price date of shipment terms, firm price terms and derivatives transactions to achieve our balanced book. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Balanced Book.\u201d\nWe may not be able to maintain our balanced book if our customers become unwilling to bear metal price risk through the matching of price date of shipment terms. We may also not be able to find counterparties for the derivatives transactions entered into in connection with firm price terms, and the cost of those derivatives transactions may increase such that entering into such transactions is no longer cost-effective to us. Those risks may increase during periods of very high copper prices or increased volatility in those prices.\nIf we fail to effectively maintain our balanced book, our profitability will be significantly affected by fluctuations in metal costs and our ability to recoup metal costs through product pricing. As a result, the volatility of our results of operations would increase dramatically. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain our balanced book approach, we will potentially replace metal at a different price than the price recovered from the customer, generating a loss in circumstances where the replacement price is higher than the price recovered from the customer.\nAlthough we maintain our balanced book approach, metal costs still affect our profitability through \u201cshrinkage\u201d and inventory valuation adjustments.\nShrinkage loss, which is primarily the loss of raw metal that occurs in the melting and casting operations, is an inherent part of a metal fabrication and conversion business. Despite our use of our balanced book approach to mitigate the impact of metal price fluctuations, we must bear the cost of any shrinkage during production, which may increase the volatility of our results of operations. Because we process a large amount of metal in our operations, a small increase in our shrinkage rates can have a significant effect on our margins and profitability. In addition, if metal prices increase, the same amount of shrinkage will have a greater effect on our manufacturing costs and have a more significant negative impact on our margins and profitability.\nThe market price of metals and related scrap used in production is subject to significant volatility. During periods when open-market prices decline below net book value, we may need to record a provision to reduce the carrying value of our inventory and increase cost of sales. Additionally, the cost of our inventories is primarily determined using the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) method. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period. In a period of rising raw material prices, cost of sales expense recognized under LIFO is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. Conversely, in a period of declining raw material prices, cost of sales recognized under LIFO is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold. The impact of LIFO accounting on our financial results may be significant with respect to period-to-period comparisons. During 2015, certain domestic metal inventory quantities were reduced, resulting in a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years as compared with metal prices prevailing in the market at the time of the inventory depletion and the effect of this reduction of inventory increased cost of sales by $0.1 million. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results and Financial Condition-Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Metal Cost.\u201d\nBecause our balanced book approach does not reduce the effects of fluctuations in metal prices on our working capital requirements, higher metal prices could have a negative effect on our liquidity.\nOur balanced book approach does not reduce the impact of the volatility in metal prices on our working capital requirements. Metal prices impact our investment in working capital because our collection terms with our customers are longer than our payment terms to our suppliers. As a result, when metal prices are rising, even if the number of pounds of metal we process does not change, we tend to use more cash or draw more on our asset-based revolving loan facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d) to cover the cash flow delay from material replacement purchase to cash collection. Thus, when metal prices increase, our working capital may be negatively affected as we are required to draw more on our cash or available financing sources to pay for raw materials. As a result, our liquidity may be negatively affected by increasing metal prices. Metal price volatility may also require us to draw on working capital sources more quickly and unpredictably, and therefore at higher cost. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results and Financial Condition-Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-Metal Cost.\u201d\nLimited access to raw materials, infrastructure or fuel could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cash flows.\nOur ability to fulfill our customer orders in a timely and cost-effective manner depends on our ability to secure a sufficient and constant supply of raw materials and fuel and access to infrastructure adequate to fulfill our business needs. Although we often seek to source our copper from scrap, including internally generated scrap and repurchases of our customers\u2019 scrap, where scrap is either not available or is not appropriate for use, we use virgin raw materials such as copper cathode, which are generally more expensive than scrap. We depend on natural gas for our manufacturing operations and source natural gas through open-market purchases.\nWe depend on scrap for our operations and acquire our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metals to us. In periods of low metal prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap waiting for higher prices. The supply of scrap metal available to us could be adversely impacted at any time due to slowdowns in industrial production or consumer consumption. If an adequate supply of scrap metal is not available to us, we would be unable to use scrap as a source of supply at desired volumes, forcing us to use a larger amount of more expensive virgin raw materials and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The acquisition of copper cathode by physically backed copper exchange traded funds and other similar entities may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase our cost of copper and copper scrap, result in potential supply shortages, and increase price volatility for copper and copper scrap. All of the above factors may affect our ability to secure the necessary raw materials in a cost-effective manner for production of our products.\nWe may experience disruptions in the supply of natural gas as a result of delivery curtailments to industrial customers due to extremely cold weather. We may also experience disruptions or increases in cost with respect to our access to water, electrical power, transport and wastewater treatment services and other infrastructure (including those subject to our transition services agreement with the parent of our predecessor). We may also experience other delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If we are unable to obtain adequate, cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and fuel or adequate and cost-effective access to infrastructure, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or harm our reputation in the markets that we serve. An inability to find an adequate and timely supply of raw materials or adequate and cost-effective access to infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our profit margin, and in turn on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost of energy could cause our cost of sales to increase, thereby reducing operating results and limiting our operating flexibility.\nIn 2015, the cost of energy and utilities represented approximately 7% of our non-metal cost of sales and prices can be volatile. As a result, our energy and utility costs may fluctuate dramatically, and we may not be able to mitigate the effect of higher energy and utility costs on our cost of sales. A substantial increase in energy costs could cause our operating costs to increase and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. Although we attempt to mitigate short-term volatility in energy and utility costs through the use of derivatives contracts, we may not be able to eliminate the long-term effects of such cost volatility. Furthermore, in an effort to offset the effect of increasing costs, we may have also limited our potential benefit from declining costs.\nOur substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operating flexibility, including our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $343.1 million (net of debt issuance costs). We also had an additional $196.9 million available for borrowing under the ABL Facility as of that date. Based on the amount of indebtedness outstanding and applicable interest rates at December 31, 2015, our annualized cash interest expense would be $33.2 million, which includes $0.4 million of interest expense related to our capital lease obligations. Additionally, we may potentially borrow under the ABL Facility, which is a floating-rate obligation, and thus, the related interest expense is subject to increase in the event interest rates were to rise.\nOur substantial indebtedness and debt service obligations could have important consequences for investors, including:\n\u2022\nthey may impose, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit agreements, significant operating and financial restrictions, including our ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or raise equity for our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nthey may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nthey may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. In addition, there would be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed.\nCovenants under our debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions. Failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indenture governing the 9.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (\u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) contain various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans, acquisitions, capital expenditures or investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets, including stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio that is tested whenever excess availability, as defined in such agreement, falls below a certain level. The fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of \u201cEBITDA\u201d (as defined in the agreement governing the ABL Facility) to the amount of our fixed charges for the twelve consecutive months prior to the date on which the ratio is tested. The agreement governing the ABL Facility also requires excess\navailability to remain above a certain level to avoid default. For more information regarding these covenants, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Covenant Compliance\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our debt agreements. A violation of covenants may result in default or an event of default under our debt agreements.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing the ABL Facility or the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the requisite lenders under the ABL Facility or the requisite noteholders under the indenture could elect to declare all amounts of such indebtedness outstanding to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the ABL Facility, terminate any commitments to extend further credit. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under such facilities may proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under the ABL Facility and to secure the Senior Secured Notes. If the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, accelerate the repayment of borrowings, such acceleration would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, cross-default provisions in the ABL Facility provide that any default under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes or other significant debt agreements could trigger a cross-default under the ABL Facility. If we are unable to repay the amounts outstanding under these agreements or obtain replacement financing on acceptable terms, which ability will depend in part upon the impact of economic conditions on the liquidity of credit markets, our creditors may exercise their rights and remedies against us and the assets that serve as collateral for the debt, including initiating a bankruptcy proceeding.\nAlthough the terms of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, which would allow us to borrow additional indebtedness. Additional leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could increase other risks harmful to our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a more detailed description on the limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and our compliance with financial covenants, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Covenant Compliance\u201d and \u201cOutstanding Indebtedness.\u201d\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash and the availability of our cash to service our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will primarily depend upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to generate cash to satisfy our debt obligations. Included in such factors are the requirements, under certain scenarios, of our counterparties that we post cash collateral to maintain our hedging positions. In addition, metal price declines, by reducing our borrowing base, could limit availability under the ABL Facility and further constrain our liquidity.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments required to be made on the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments (including the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes) may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives, which in turn could exacerbate the effects of any failure to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance our obligations at all or on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to business changes or to take certain actions, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes.\nBecause some of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates, we are vulnerable to interest rate increases.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had less than $0.1 million outstanding under the ABL Facility, which bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short-term interest rates. If we borrow under the ABL Facility and if interest rates increase dramatically, we could be unable to service our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our largest customers, our sales volumes, revenues and cash flows could be reduced.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration. Our five largest customers were responsible for approximately 30% of our net sales in 2015. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, adverse economic and market conditions could also harm our business by negatively affecting our customers, which could impair their ability to pay for products they have purchased from our Company. Our balance sheet reflected an allowance for doubtful accounts totaling $1.2 million at December 31, 2015. If adverse economic and market conditions impair the ability of our customers to pay us in the future, our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable from the Company\u2019s customers may increase in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term contractual arrangements with a substantial number of our customers, and our sales volumes and net sales could be reduced if our customers switch some or all of their business with us to other suppliers.\nIn 2015, a majority of our net sales were generated from customers who do not have long-term contractual arrangements with us, including several of our largest customers. These customers purchase products and services from us on a purchase order basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. A significant loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a material negative impact on our sales volume and business, or cause us to reduce our prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be disrupted if our customers shift either their manufacturing or sourcing offshore.\nMuch of our business depends on maintaining close geographical proximity to our customers because the costs of transporting metals across large distances can be prohibitive. If the general trend in relocating or contracting manufacturing capacity to foreign countries continues, especially those in the automotive parts, electrical connectors, and building and housing components industries, such relocations or contracting may disrupt or end our relationships with some customers and could lead to losing business to foreign competitors. In addition, some customers may seek to source their finished products offshore, thereby also increasing the amount of manufacturing offshore and thereby reducing demand for brass rod in the United States. These risks would increase to the extent we are unable to expand internationally when our customers do so.\nDecreased demand from the United States Mint could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States Mint is a significant customer of Olin Brass. Olin Brass has a contractual arrangement to supply nickel and brass coinage strip to the two United States Mint locations. Our supply agreement with the United States Mint runs through 2017. The United States Mint can also terminate the contract in whole or in part for convenience, and the damages payable to us by the United States Mint for such a termination do not include lost profits. The loss or reduction of any authorized supplier arrangement with the United States Mint for coin manufacture could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the United States Government contracting and procurement cycle can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process. As a result, our net sales and operating income may fluctuate, causing us to occasionally experience declines in net sales or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Treasury department announced in December 2011 a halt in the production of Presidential dollar coins for circulation due to a lack of demand (which is primarily the result of the U.S. continuing the use of the dollar bill).\nAlthough their production will continue for the collectibles market, it is uncertain when their production for circulation will be resumed. This action has adversely impacted our business and is expected to adversely impact our business over the next several years. In addition, in December 2013, three members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors issued a report that concluded that a transition to the dollar coin would result in higher net costs to the Federal government and to the public, which contrasts with previous reports by the Government Accountability Office that there would be a net benefit from a transition. Further actions to curtail coin production could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFollowing trends in electronic commerce, the United States Mint in the future may reduce its output of coinage and thus reduce its demand for coinage strip. A reduction in demand for coinage strip could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreased demand from Orbital ATK, Inc. (\u201cATK\u201d) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, a sizeable share of the production of our Olin Brass segment supports ATK, a supplier of munitions to the U.S. Army. ATK uses our product to service its contract with the U.S. Army to supply the U.S. Army\u2019s arsenal located at Independence, Missouri. ATK is under contract with the U.S. Army to supply it with small-caliber ammunition and Olin Brass is under contract to supply ATK. In spite of these contractual arrangements, any decrease in demand from ATK or other disruption of our relationship with ATK could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in our industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. Each of our segments competes with a limited number of companies. The Olin Brass segment competes with domestic and foreign manufacturers of copper and brass alloys in the form of strip, sheet and foil. The Chase Brass segment competes with domestic as well as foreign manufacturers of brass rod and beginning in 2013, encountered increased competition from foreign rod suppliers. The A.J. Oster segment primarily competes with distributors, mills and processors of copper and brass products. Furthermore, we believe that domestic sales to customers that are not made by major companies, including us, are fragmented among many smaller companies. In the future, these smaller companies may choose to combine, creating a more significant domestic competitor against our business. We may be required to explore additional initiatives in each of our segments in order to maintain our sales volume at a competitive level. Increased competition in any of the fields in which our segments operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, anti-dumping orders impose import duties on copper and brass products from France, Germany, Italy and Japan which allow us and our domestic competitors to compete more fairly against French, German, Italian and Japanese producers in the U.S. copper and brass product market. On March 21, 2012, the International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) Commissioners voted to continue anti-dumping orders for brass sheet and strip from Germany, Italy, France and Japan. While domestic manufacturers lobby for the continued extension of these orders, if they expire, import duties on metal products from these countries will be significantly reduced, increasing the ability of such foreign producers to compete with our products domestically. Additionally, on March 15, 2012, the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (\u201cKORUS FTA\u201d) became effective, which largely eliminates tariffs on Korean industrial products imported to the United States. The reduction in prices of Korean products resulting from the KORUS FTA has increased the ability of Korean manufacturers to compete with our products and has had a negative effect on our business. Furthermore, the termination of any anti-dumping orders or other changes to international trade regimes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse developments in our relationship with our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 1,900 employees, 1,168, or approximately 61%, of whom at various sites were members of unions. We have generally maintained good relationships with all unions and employees, which has been an important aspect of our ability to be competitive in our industry. The current collective bargaining agreements that are in place are a meaningful determinant of our labor costs and are very important to our ability to maintain flexibility to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs. As we attempt to renew our collective bargaining agreements, labor negotiations may not conclude successfully and, in that case, may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor or may result in work stoppages or labor disturbances, disrupting our operations. Any such cost increases, stoppages or disturbances could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by limiting plant production, sales volumes and profitability.\nOur participation in multi-employer union pension plans may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe are required to make contributions to the IAM National Pension Plan (\u201cIAM Plan\u201d), a multi-employer pension plan that covers certain of our union employees. Our U.S. multi-employer pension plan expense totaled $3.8 million in 2015. Our obligations may be impacted by the funded status of the plan, the plan\u2019s investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. In addition, if a participating employer becomes insolvent and ceases to contribute to a multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligation of the plan will be borne by the remaining participating employers. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur withdrawal liability to the plan. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from the multi-employer pension plan in which we participate, we will likely need to record withdrawal liabilities, which could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness at our domestic and international locations, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel. Our facilities and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and similar events. We have facilities located throughout North America, including in Illinois, Ohio, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Missouri, California, Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as in China. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including obtaining insurance and maintaining health and safety protocols. However, a natural disaster, such as a tornado, fire, flood, hurricane or earthquake, could cause a substantial interruption in our operations, damage or destroy our facilities or inventory and cause us to incur additional expenses. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case, which would require us to expend significant resources to replace any destroyed assets, thereby harming our financial condition and prospects significantly.\nFor example, Olin Brass\u2019s manufacturing facilities and A.J. Oster\u2019s California facility are located near geologic fault zones, and therefore are subject to greater risk of earthquakes which could result in increased costs and a disruption in our operations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition significantly. Our facility in East Alton, Illinois is located in a flood zone, and all of our facilities in the Midwestern United States are subject to the risk of tornadoes and damaging winds. Should earthquakes or other catastrophes, such as fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, power outages, communication failures or similar events disable our facilities, we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could continue our operations, and any resulting stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results. Acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities.\nAny prolonged disruptions at or failures of our manufacturing facilities and equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to satisfy our customers\u2019 orders in an efficient manner and to effectively manage inventory levels is dependent on the proper operation of our facilities and equipment. On-time delivery and accurate order fulfillment are essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and generating repeat business. To the extent we experience prolonged equipment failures, quality control incidents or other disruptions such as a major fire at our manufacturing facilities, our ability to satisfy our customers could be negatively impacted, and if, as a result, customer satisfaction decreased, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we do not have redundancy in our operations on certain critical pieces of equipment, including the Olin Brass hot and cold mills and Chase Brass extruders. If this equipment were damaged, we would have to make alternative arrangements to replicate these processes, which could be costly and result in manufacturing delays, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInclement weather conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInclement weather conditions in the areas where our facilities are located could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme cold, heavy snowfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could result in temporary facility closures, disruptions in our access to natural gas, electricity, fuel and other raw materials and delayed shipments of our products. Furthermore, inclement weather conditions also could disrupt the operations of one or more of our suppliers and result in production delays. Any of these events or circumstances could materially disrupt our business operations and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to meet the capital expenditure requirements for the introduction of new products or substantial further increases in the production of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our existing products, such as Eco Brass\u00ae and other potential \u201cgreen portfolio\u201d products, require separate production streams from those used for our other products in order to comply with applicable standards. As a result, in order to meet expected increased demand for such products, we will be required to make additional capital expenditures to modify or expand our facilities. In addition, if we introduce new products in the future, those products may also require modification or expansion of our production facilities. To accommodate any such production changes, we will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand or modify our facilities. If we are unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements, we may not be able to timely respond to our customers\u2019 needs and may lose their business to our competitors who may be better equipped to meet these needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of substitute materials and miniaturization may adversely affect our business.\nIn many applications, copper and other commodities may be replaced by other materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, plastic and other materials and the use of copper and other commodities may be reduced by the miniaturization of components. Increased prices of copper could encourage our customers to use substitute materials and / or miniaturization to limit the amount of copper in their products and applications in an attempt to control their overall product costs. For example, historically, there has been discussion over reducing or eliminating copper content in coins in reaction to the rising prices of copper. Such increased use of substitute materials and / or miniaturization could have a material adverse effect on prices and demand for our products.\nIn order to operate our business successfully, we must meet evolving customer requirements for copper and copper-alloy products and invest in the development of new products.\nIf we fail to develop or enhance our products to satisfy evolving customer demands, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects may be harmed significantly. The market for copper and copper-alloy products is characterized by changing technologies, periodic new product introductions and evolving customer and industry standards. Eco Brass\u00ae and other products in our \u201cgreen portfolio\u201d are examples of new products based on new technologies that have been developed as a result of evolving customer and industry standards. Our competitors are continuously searching for more cost-effective alloys and substitutes for copper and copper-alloys, including products in our \u201cgreen portfolio.\u201d Our current and prospective customers may choose products that might be offered at a lower price than our products. To achieve market acceptance for our products, we must effectively and timely anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands. This strategy may cause us to pursue other technologies or capabilities through acquisitions or strategic alliances. We may experience design, engineering and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products and services. Our failure to successfully develop and offer products or services that satisfy customer requirements may significantly weaken demand for our products and services, which would likely cause a decrease in our net sales and harm our operating results. In addition, if our competitors introduce products and / or services based on new or alternative technologies, our existing and future products and / or services could become obsolete, which would also weaken demand for our products or services, thereby decreasing our net sales and harming our operating results.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, including our growth initiatives, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success depend in large part on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy or be able to continue improving our operating results. In particular, we may not be able to continue to achieve all operating cost savings, further enhance our product mix, expand into selected targeted regions or continue to mitigate our exposure to metal price fluctuations.\nThe implementation of our business strategy may be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal and regulatory developments, general economic conditions, the increase of operating costs or our ability to introduce new products and end-use applications. Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nFurthermore, we may not be successful in our growth initiatives and may not be able to effectively manage expanded or acquired operations. See \u201cWe face a number of risks related to future acquisitions and joint ventures.\u201d\nA portion of our net sales is derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad.\nIn the aggregate, our international operations accounted for 6% of our net sales in 2015. We have operations in China through Olin Luotong Metals and in Singapore through our subsidiary GBC Metals Asia Pacific PTE. In addition, we have various licensing agreements around the world and our products are distributed globally. We plan to continue to explore opportunities to expand our international operations. Our international operations generally are subject to risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and international governmental regulations, trade restrictions and laws, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises or government policies favoring local production;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u2022\ncurrency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\ndiffering protections for intellectual property and enforcement thereof;\n\u2022\ndivergent environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nunfamiliarity with foreign laws and regulations and ability to enforce obligations of foreign counterparties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations and labor unrest;\n\u2022\nlanguage and cultural barriers;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and widespread illness;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war, or other military action; and\n\u2022\na divergence between the price of copper on the copper exchange in China and the LME, and the COMEX.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could cause our costs to rise, limit growth opportunities or have a negative effect on our operations and our ability to plan for future periods, and subject us to risks not generally prevalent in North America.\nNew governmental regulations or legislation, or changes in existing regulations or legislation, may subject us to significant costs, taxes and restrictions on our operations.\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of U.S. Federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, international trade and competition and firearms.\nFor example, the Olin Brass segment provides strip and cups to both the military and commercial munitions markets. In 2015, the shipments by Olin Brass to the munitions market accounted for 38% of its total shipments. The private use of firearms is subject to extensive regulation. Recent U.S. Federal legislative activities generally seek either to restrict or ban the sale and, in some cases, the ownership of various types of firearms and ammunition. Several states currently have laws in effect similar to that legislation. Any restriction on the use of firearms and ammunition could affect the demand for munitions, and in turn could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, any changes in the government budget or policy over military spending may adversely affect our contracts with customers in the munitions market.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including possibly with retroactive effect, and audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed in the U.S., such as the repeal of the election to use LIFO or to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate. If the U.S. corporate tax rate were lowered, we would be required to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time increase to income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years. The cost of our inventories is primarily determined using LIFO. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period. Generally in a period of rising prices, LIFO recognizes higher costs of goods sold, which both reduces current income and assigns a lower value to the year-end inventory. If the election to use the LIFO method for U.S. Federal income tax purposes were repealed, taxpayers that currently use the LIFO method would be required to revalue their beginning LIFO inventory to its first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) value. The repeal of the election to use the LIFO method could result in a substantial cash tax liability, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, a transition to the FIFO method could result in an increase in the volatility of our earnings, a greater disparity between our earnings and net sales in our financial statements, and an increase in the costs associated with our derivative transactions to mitigate metal price fluctuations.\nIn addition, any termination or expiration of trade restrictions imposed on copper products by foreign governments could adversely affect our business as such products become freely tradable into the U.S. This may increase competition against our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cCompetition in our industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nWe may not be able to sustain the annual cost savings realized as part of our cost-reduction initiatives.\nWe will continue to undertake productivity and cost-reduction initiatives intended to improve performance and improve operating cash flow. Although we believe that the cost savings we have realized through our efforts so far are permanent reductions, we may not be able to sustain some or all of these cost savings on an annual basis in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any new initiatives undertaken in the future will be completed or beneficial to us or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.\nOur operations expose our employees to risk of injury or death. We may be subject to claims that are not covered by, or exceed, our insurance. Additional safety measures or rules imposed by regulatory agencies may reduce productivity, require additional capital expenditure or reduce profitability.\nBecause of the manufacturing activities conducted at our facilities, there exists a risk of injury or death to our employees or other visitors, notwithstanding the safety precautions we take. Our operations are subject to regulation by Federal, state and local agencies responsible for employee health and safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has from time to time taken various actions with respect to our facilities, including imposing fines for certain isolated incidents. Despite policies and standards that are designed to minimize such risks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any employee death or injury that may occur in the future. These types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, various regulatory agencies may impose additional safety measures or other rules designed to increase workplace safety. Compliance with such requirements could require additional capital expenditure or cause process changes that could reduce the productivity of the affected facilities, which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability.\nOur ability to retain our senior management team is critical to the success of our business, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team to remain competitive in our industry. We have employment contracts or severance agreements with members of our senior management team, including John Wasz, Robert Micchelli, Kevin Bense, Devin Denner and William Toler. Failure to renew the employment contracts or other agreements of a significant portion of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Members of our senior management team are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that permit the employees to terminate their employment without notice. We do not maintain any life insurance policies for our benefit covering our key employees.\nIf our senior management team were not able to dedicate adequate time to our business, due to personal or other factors, if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of a significant portion of our senior management team, or if a significant portion of our senior management team were to terminate employment within a short period it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team, should the need arise.\nRising employee medical costs may adversely affect operating results.\nThe extent to which our employee medical costs will increase in the future is difficult to assess at this time. In 2015, our costs related to employee health benefits were $19.0 million. Because the implementation of various laws regarding employee medical costs and health insurance, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and other related regulations, is currently in progress, there is some uncertainty as to how these current and future laws and regulations will affect our employee medical and other benefit costs. In addition, the cost of health care has been rising generally over time, and such increases have been in the past and will in the future be unpredictable and at times significant. If we were to incur significant increases in employee medical costs and related items, whether due to such laws and regulations or otherwise, it could adversely impact our operating results.\nEnvironmental costs could decrease our net cash flow and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulations governing the creation, use, transportation and disposal of wastes and hazardous substances, air and water emissions, remediation, workplace exposure and other environmental matters. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and clean-ups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, can be significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Future environmental regulations could impose stricter compliance requirements on us and the markets that we serve. Additional pollution control equipment, process changes, or other environmental control measures may be needed at some of our facilities to meet future requirements. Additionally, evolving regulatory standards and expectations could result in increased litigation and / or increased costs of compliance with environmental laws, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites, at previously owned sites, sites previously operated by us, sites owned by our predecessors or sites that we may acquire in the future. Our operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health, safety or environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to several sites. The properties we own or lease are located in areas with a history of heavy industrial use. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.\u201d The CERCLA established responsibility for clean-up without regard to fault for persons who have released or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at sites that have become contaminated and for persons who own or operate contaminated facilities. In many cases, courts have imposed joint and several liability on parties at CERCLA clean-up sites. Because a number of our properties are located in or near industrial or light industrial use areas, they may have been contaminated by pollutants which may have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been released by prior occupants. Some of our properties have been affected by releases of cutting oils and similar materials, and we are investigating and remediating such known contamination pursuant to applicable environmental laws. The costs of these clean-ups have not been material in the past. We are not currently subject to any material claims or notices with respect to clean-up or remediation under CERCLA or similar laws for contamination at our leased or owned properties or at any off-site location. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that we could be notified of such claims in the future. It is also possible that we could be identified by the Environmental Protection Agency, a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or under analogous state laws.\nOn November 19, 2007, we acquired the assets and operations relating to the worldwide metals business of Olin Corporation. Olin Corporation agreed to retain liability arising out of then existing conditions on certain of our properties for any remedial actions required by environmental laws, and agreed to indemnify us for all or part of a number of other environmental liabilities. Since 2007, Olin Corporation has been performing remedial actions at the facilities in East Alton, Illinois and Waterbury, Connecticut, and has been participating in remedial actions at our other properties as well. If Olin Corporation were to stop its environmental remedial activities at our properties, we could be required to assume responsibility for these activities, the cost of which could be material. For additional information concerning the indemnity granted to us by Olin Corporation for environmental liabilities, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nNew governmental regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations.\nIn the past, Congress has considered legislation that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where we have manufacturing plants, are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. The EPA has also proposed several comprehensive regulations that would require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by several types of sources. Certain of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity, natural gas and diesel, and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas above certain minimum thresholds that are likely to be regulated. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to, or the use of, natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions, require operational changes or the use of new equipment or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could significantly increase our costs or capital expenditures, reduce our competitiveness or otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is too early to predict how any potential greenhouse gas regulation may affect us.\nWe may be subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. These suits concern issues including product liability, contract disputes, employee-related matters and personal injury matters. It is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims, and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reputation.\nWe may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity.\nIf any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers, we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits. If we were found liable under product liability claims, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages and see a decrease in demand for our products. Further, even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend time and resources to defend against these claims, we could face negative publicity or our reputation could otherwise suffer, any of which could result in a decrease in demand for our products or otherwise harm our business.\nNew derivatives legislation could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative contracts to manage risks associated with our business and on the cost of our derivative contracts.\nWe use over-the-counter, or OTC, derivatives products to manage our metal commodity, natural gas and electricity price risks. The Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) has increased regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets and imposed restrictions on certain derivative transactions, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. Not all implementing regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized. If final regulations subject us to heightened capital or margin requirements or otherwise increase our costs, directly or indirectly through costs passed on to us by our trading counterparties, of entering into OTC derivatives transactions, they could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of maintaining our derivative contracts.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. While we continue to evaluate our internal controls, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Further, we may be required to expend substantial funds and resources in order to rectify any deficiencies in our internal controls. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor and lender confidence and it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations.\nIncreasing costs of insurance may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we are insured against certain claims, including in respect of general liability, property damage (including natural disasters and fire), ocean cargo liability, equipment damage and injury to our personnel, our insurance may not cover all of the claims to which we may become subject, and future coverage of such claims may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, substantial property or equipment damage, personal injury or other claims could materially impact our earnings and cash flows. Continued increases in insurance costs, additional coverage restrictions or unavailability of certain insurance products and other factors could increase our operating costs and further increase our exposure to natural disasters and other causes of catastrophic loss, as well as personal injury and other claims.\nFailure to protect, or uncertainty regarding the validity, enforceability or scope of, our intellectual property rights could impair our competitive position.\nOur products are covered by a variety of proprietary rights that are important to our competitive position and success. Because the intellectual property associated with our products, including Eco Brass\u00ae technology, is evolving and rapidly changing, our current intellectual property rights may not protect us adequately. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, in addition to contractual rights, to protect the intellectual property we use in our business. However, it is possible that our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or violated. Our pending patent applications may not be granted or, if granted, the resulting patent may be challenged or invalidated by our competitors or by other third parties. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization. In addition, monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will prevent infringement or identify all unauthorized users of our intellectual property.\nBecause the extent to which any new technologies will enjoy intellectual property protection is uncertain, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive position by enforcing intellectual property rights in the future. Furthermore, our competitors independently may develop similar or improved technologies that limit the value of our intellectual property or design around patents issued to us. If competitors or third parties are able to use our intellectual property or are able to successfully challenge, circumvent, invalidate or render unenforceable our intellectual property, we likely would lose a significant portion of our competitive advantage in the market for products covered by such intellectual property. We may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary or patent protection for the technology used in our products and services, and protection that is secured may be challenged and possibly lost. We may have to prosecute unauthorized uses of our intellectual property and the expense, time, delay and burden on management of such litigation could prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business. Our inability to protect our intellectual property adequately for these and other reasons could result in weakened demand for our products and services, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, Chase Brass has entered into agreements with Mitsubishi Shindoh pursuant to which Chase Brass has access to and the right to use certain of its technologies including lead-free Eco Brass\u00ae rod and the sublicensing of lead-free Eco Brass\u00ae ingot. To the extent that Mitsubishi Shindoh faces challenges to its intellectual property rights in its technologies or fails to protect or enforce such intellectual property rights, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products and / or services that incorporate those technologies or could permit competitors using infringing or similar technology to compete more effectively against us, which would result in a decline in our net sales.\nWe could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could harm our business significantly.\nOur commercial success will continue to depend in part on our ability to make and sell our products or provide our services without infringing the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We face these risks with respect to intellectual property that we have developed internally, as well as with respect to intellectual property rights we have acquired from third parties. For example, pursuant to a license agreement, we have access to and the right to use certain technologies owned by Mitsubishi Shindoh, including our lead-free Eco Brass\u00ae rod. To the extent that Mitsubishi Shindoh fails to adequately protect the technologies upon which we rely, our competitors may be able to use such technologies or develop similar technologies independently. Recently in July 2014, a complaint was filed against Mitsubishi Shindoh alleging that, among other things, certain patents owned by Mitsubishi Shindoh (including those used in our Eco Brass\u00ae technology) are invalid and unenforceable. While we do not anticipate such litigation will have a material impact on our results of operations, there can be no assurances that a favorable outcome will be achieved, and any of the foregoing events, including an adverse result in this litigation, could lead to increased competition and negatively impact our volumes and / or margins.\nAdditionally, if the technologies upon which we rely infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of third parties, we may be unable to continue using such technologies or we may face lawsuits related to our past use of these technologies. Furthermore, our competitors, who have made significant investments in competing technologies or products, may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make or sell our products or provide our services.\nIf we are unsuccessful in defending against any challenge to our rights to market and sell our products, our rights to use third-party technologies or to provide our services, we may, among other things, be required to:\n\u2022\npay actual damages, royalties, lost profits and / or increased damages and the third party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be substantial;\n\u2022\ncease the development, manufacture and / or marketing of our products or services that use the intellectual property in question through a court-imposed injunction or settlement agreement;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to modify or redesign our products or other technology or services so that they do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others or to develop or acquire non-infringing technology, which may not be possible; or\n\u2022\nobtain licenses to the disputed rights, which could require us to pay substantial upfront fees and future royalty payments and may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nEven if we successfully defend any infringement claims, the expense, time, delay and burden on management of litigation could prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business. Further, negative publicity could decrease demand for our products and services and cause our revenues to decline, thus harming our operating results significantly.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology, products and services could be harmed significantly.\nWe rely on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information in operating our business. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors and others who may have access to such proprietary information upon commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property. Nonetheless, those agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information.\nTo the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information, which may not be resolved in our favor. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets become known or independently discovered by competitors, could harm us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. The disclosure of our trade secrets\nwould impair our competitive position, thereby weakening demand for our products or services and harming our ability to maintain or increase our customer base.\nIn addition, to the extent that we do not fulfill our contractual or other obligations to adequately protect the technologies to which we have been granted access by Mitsubishi Shindoh, we could be liable for any resulting harm to its business or could lose further access to this technology, which could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nDisruption or failures of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on the Company\u2019s information technology systems, most of which have not been updated for many years. As a result, our information technology systems are more susceptible to security breaches, operational data loss, general disruptions in functionality, and may not be compatible with new technology. We depend on our information technology systems for the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers, as well as to maintain financial records and accuracy. Disruption or failures of our information technology systems or security breaches could impair our ability to effectively and timely provide our services and products and maintain our financial records, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. Olin Brass began the process of implementing a fully integrated enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system to replace its current management information systems and plans to implement the system in a phased approach over the course of the next several years. A.J. Oster is in the process of implementing an ERP system to replace its current management information systems and plans to implement by the end of fiscal 2016. These implementations may present challenges. Such challenges include, among other things, training of personnel, communication of new rules and procedures, changes in corporate culture, migration of data and the potential instability of the new system. Furthermore, large-scale system implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that are capital intensive and can span several months or even years. Certain of our business and financial processes also may require transformation in order to effectively leverage the ERP system\u2019s benefits. The ERP system implementation may not result in the anticipated improvements and the cost of implementation may outweigh the benefits. There can be no assurance that the ERP system will be successfully implemented, and failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur liquidity, financial condition and ability to operate our business could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities.\nThe ABL Facility is an asset-based revolving loan facility with a maximum availability of $200.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculation. We may request an increase in the maximum commitments, at our option and under certain circumstances, of up to $50.0 million (but the lenders are not obligated to grant such an increase). If one or more of the financial institutions that are lenders under the ABL Facility were to default on its obligations to provide available borrowings under the ABL Facility, such a default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, and we might not be able to fulfill our cash needs using other sources, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to operate our business.\nGlobal Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. is a holding company and relies on future dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations and provide cash for any dividends it might pay in the future.\nGlobal Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. has no direct operations and derives all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries. Because Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to its common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and other debt agreements governing current and future indebtedness of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries, may limit the ability of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc.\u2019s to pay any dividends on our common stock. See \u201cRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock-Our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our debt agreements and limitations in Delaware law.\u201d\nWe face a number of risks related to future acquisitions and joint ventures.\nWe may continue to seek opportunities for further acquisitions to supplement our operations and for expansion of our international presence, particularly in Asia, through joint ventures.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of risks which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience adverse short-term effects on our operating results;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to successfully and rapidly integrate the new businesses, personnel and products with our existing business, including financial reporting, management and information technology systems;\n\u2022\nwe may experience higher than anticipated costs of integration and unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may be in a market or geographical area in which we have little experience and could increase the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition or joint venture formation process may require significant attention by our senior management and the engagement of outside advisors (and the payment of related fees), and proposed acquisitions and joint ventures may not be successfully completed;\n\u2022\nwe may lose key employees or customers of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter unknown contingent liabilities that could be material.\nIn addition, we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if available at all. We may not be able to successfully integrate or profitably operate any new business we acquire, and we cannot assure you that any such acquisition will meet our expectations. The process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Finally, in the event we decide to discontinue pursuit of a potential acquisition, we will be required to immediately expense all costs incurred in pursuit of the possible acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the expense is recognized.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through a joint venture which has unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through our joint venture located in China. With respect to our joint venture, we may share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more partners that may not share our goals and objectives. Operating a joint venture requires us to operate the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement that we entered into with our partners, including additional organizational formalities, as well as to share information and decision making. As a result, our investments in joint ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently. These risks include the possibility that our joint ventures or our partners: have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives; subject the joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated; take actions that reduce our return on investment; or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business. Additionally, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has a limited trading history, and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected if an active trading market in our common stock is not sustained. Our stock price may be volatile, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the purchase price or at all.\nOur common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) on May 23, 2013 and as a result has a limited trading history. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest will sustain an active trading market. The market price of our common stock will be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results and market conditions specific to our industry. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares at a price that is attractive to you, or at all.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur stock price may be volatile. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nthe price outlook for copper and copper-alloys;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our or other industries;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u2022\nour results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nshrinkage from our processing operations;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and environmental regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares to be publicly traded in the future;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us, members of our management team or other holders;\n\u2022\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions, costs and future events related to proxy contests or other shareholder activity;\n\u2022\nany announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions and their effects on global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, widespread illness and responses to such events; or\n\u2022\nany material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nSee \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d These and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the price at which it was purchased.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price and materially affect the value of your investment.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall significantly even if our business is profitable.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions or investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may\nalso grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions or investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuance of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or investment), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our debt agreements and limitations in Delaware law.\nOn November 7, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share of our common stock to our stockholders and the Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.0375 per share of common stock in every subsequent quarter to date. Any future determination to pay dividends, however, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements including limitations in Delaware law, restrictions in our debt agreements, including those governing the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes, that limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders, our strategic opportunities and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. At this time, the agreement governing the ABL Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes generally restrict or limit the payment of dividends to shareholders. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes includes a \u201crestricted payments\u201d basket based on Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the indenture). It increases based on 50% of Consolidated Net Income (as so defined) and decreases by 100% of Consolidated Net Loss (as so defined). The basket may be negative or insufficient to pay dividends. For the foregoing reasons, you will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment. Accordingly, if you purchase shares, realization of a gain on your investment may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which might diminish the value of our common stock.\nThe amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of the Board of Directors. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. The provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by written consent of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nvacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; and\n\u2022\nsupermajority approval requirement for an amendment of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. has elected in its amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThe provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. and the ability of the Board of Directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or implement a stockholder rights plan could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. One or more analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. In addition, we may be unable or be slow to attract research coverage. Alternatively, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing, and the costs we incur for such purposes may strain our resources. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, divert management\u2019s attention to ensuring compliance and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We have hired a number of people to assist with the enhanced requirements of being a public company but may still need to hire more people for that purpose. In addition, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. In addition, these laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Board of Directors, its board committees or as its executive officers and may divert management\u2019s attention. Furthermore, if Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. is unable to satisfy its obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action.\nAny issuance of preferred stock could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by its stockholders. Such preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d that involve risks and uncertainties.
