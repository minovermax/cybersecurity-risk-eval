RISK FACTORS\nThis section describes the major risks to us, our business and our common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the notes thereto and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (MD&A) before making an investment decision. The statements contained in this section constitute cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects may be adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors that could impact us. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic negative impact on the health of citizens of many countries, and resulted in major disruptions in economies and markets around the world, including our key markets. In addition, it is unclear what effects the recently engaged conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to have on the world economy and certain of our target markets, including particularly the oil and gas market. Accordingly, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all risks and uncertainties pertaining to us and our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDue to our dependency on customers in the oil and gas industry, we are susceptible to prolonged negative trends relating to this industry that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur customers in the oil and gas industry have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical revenues. Specifically, they accounted for approximately 54%, 54%, and 55% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although we have expanded our customer base into industries other than the oil and gas industry, we still receive a majority of our revenues from this industry. Our services are vital to the operators of plants and refineries and we have expanded our services offerings, such as expanding our mechanical services capabilities. However, economic slowdowns or low oil prices have, and could continue to, result in cutbacks in contracts for our services. In addition, low oil prices could depress the level of new exploration and construction, which would adversely affect our market opportunities. If the price of oil were to decrease to prior year levels, our revenues, profits and cash flows may be reduced. While we continue to expand our market presence in the aerospace, power generation and transmission, and the chemical processing industries, among others, these markets are also cyclical in nature and as such, are subject to economic downturns. In addition, it is unclear what effects the recently engaged conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to have on the world economy and certain of our target markets, including particularly the oil and gas market.\nWe may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change\nClimate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions on emissions, including those that have already been adopted and others that are expected to be adopted in the future, could affect our customers that (a) use commodities to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of fossil fuel to produce or deliver commodities, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of fossil fuels or burn fossil fuels. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets we serve (including the oil and gas industry), which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets we serve in an unpredictable manner. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur long-term growth strategy may include acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses successfully, which may adversely impact our results. Furthermore, acquisitions that we have completed or may complete in the future could expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks.\nA significant factor in our growth has been based upon our ability to make acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses. We have used acquisitions both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets. This strategy has provided us with many benefits and has helped fuel our growth, but also carries with it many risks. While we have not made a material acquisition in the past two years, we do expect to make acquisitions in the future, subject to the restrictions in our debt covenants. Some of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy include:\n\u2022whether we successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, and complete proposed acquisitions;\n\u2022whether we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our current operations, including our accounting, internal control and information technology systems, marketing and other key infrastructure;\n\u2022whether we can adequately capture opportunities that an acquired business may offer, including the expansion into new markets in which we have little to no experience or presence;\n\u2022whether we value an acquired business properly when determining the purchase price and terms, and whether we are able to achieve the returns on the investment we expect;\n\u2022whether an acquired business can achieve the levels of revenues, profitability, productivity or cost savings we expect;\n\u2022whether an acquired business is compatible with our culture and philosophy of doing business;\n\u2022the unexpected loss of key personnel and customers of an acquired business;\n\u2022the assumption of liabilities and risks (including environmental-related costs) of an acquired business, some of which may not be anticipated;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other personnel and of those of the acquired business resulting from the efforts to acquire, then integrate, an acquired business;\n\u2022the potential for greater exposure to risks associated with international operations; and\n\u2022the amount and cost of funding (including borrowings under our credit agreement) to acquire and integrate other businesses (some of which may require substantial funding) and the impact of the acquisition and borrowing on our continued compliance with covenants in our credit agreement.\nOur ability to undertake acquisitions is limited by our financial resources, including available cash and borrowing capacity. Due to our current debt levels and restrictions related to the covenants in our credit facility, we do not expect to make any acquisitions in 2022, other than small acquisitions with the banks\u2019 approval. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Although we intend to: (i) evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, (ii) assume only risks we believe to be acceptable, and (iii) develop plans to mitigate such risks, there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain or accurately assess the extent of all such risks. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet from our acquisitions. This will increase as we complete more acquisitions. If our acquisitions do not perform as planned and we do not realize the benefits and profitability we expect, we could incur significant write-downs and impairment charges to our earnings due to the impairment of the goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired or acquire in the future. We experienced such write-downs and impairment charges in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 (see Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report).\nOur international operations are subject to risks relating to non-U.S. operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated approximately 30%, 31%, and 34% of our revenues outside the United States, respectively. In addition, our international operations as a percentage of our business may increase over time. Our primary operations outside the United States are in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Brazil. We also have operations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and India. There are numerous risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022varying regional and geopolitical business and economic conditions and demands;\n\u2022compliance with applicable foreign regulations and licensing requirements, and U.S. laws and regulation with respect to conducting business in other countries, including export controls, sanctions, anti-terrorist, and anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022the cost and uncertainty of obtaining data and creating solutions that are relevant to particular geographic markets;\n\u2022the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;\n\u2022the complexity of maintaining effective policies and procedures in locations around the world;\n\u2022political instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022increased risk of hacking, malware or security breaches of our data and databases;\n\u2022restrictions or limitations on outsourcing contracts or services abroad;\n\u2022restrictions or limitations on the repatriation of funds, or tax consequences on the non-repatriation of overseas operationally generated funds; and\n\u2022other potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe expect to continue expanding and our success depends on how effectively we manage our growth.\nWe expect to continue experiencing growth in the number of employees and the scope of our operations over the long-term. To effectively manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, compliance, financial and reporting systems and capabilities, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. We expect that all these measures will require significant expenditures and will demand the attention of management. Failure to manage our growth effectively could lead us to over or under-invest in technology and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems, compliance programs or controls, and give rise to operational mistakes, the loss of business opportunities, the loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new solutions. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our profit margins may suffer, our revenues could decline or may grow more slowly than expected and we may be unable to implement our business strategy as anticipated.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our significant customers.\nWe derive a significant amount of revenues from a few customers. Taken as a group, our top ten customers were responsible for approximately 33%, 32%, and 34% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This concentration pertains almost exclusively to our Services segment, which accounted for 82%, 80% and 80% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These customers are primarily in the oil and gas sector. Generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services or may terminate existing orders or contracts at any time with little or no financial penalty. The loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our significant customers could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn accident or incident involving our asset protection solutions could expose us to claims, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to compete for business and, as a result, harm our operating performance.\nWe could be exposed to liabilities arising out of the solutions we provide. For instance, we furnish the results of our testing and inspections for use by our customers in their assessment of their assets, facilities, plants and other structures. If such results were to be incorrect or incomplete, as a result of, for instance, poorly designed inspections, malfunctioning testing equipment or our employees\u2019 failure to adequately test or properly record data, we could be subject to claims. Further, if an accident or incident involving a structure we tested occurs and causes personal injuries or property damage, such as the collapse of a bridge or an explosion in a facility, and particularly if these injuries or damages could have been prevented by our customers had we provided them with correct or complete results, we would likely face significant claims relating to personal injury, property damage or other losses. Even if our results are correct and complete, we may face claims for such injuries or damage simply because we tested the structure or facility in question. In addition, during the course of a single engagement, such as the inspection of a pipeline, we often perform tests on thousands of welds. Even if the accuracy of only a small number of these test results are questioned, a customer may attempt to refuse payment for the entire project. While we do have insurance, our insurance coverage does not cover non-payment by customers and may not be adequate to cover the damages from any of the prior referenced claims, forcing us to bear these uninsured damages directly, which could harm our operating results and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenues. An accident or incident for which we are found partially or fully responsible, even if fully insured, or even an incident at a customer or site for which we provide services although we were found not to be responsible, may also result in negative publicity, which would harm our reputation among our customers and the public, cause us to lose existing and future contracts or make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, thereby significantly harming our operating performance. In addition, the occurrence of an accident or incident might also make it more expensive or extremely difficult for us to insure against similar events in the future.\nMany of the sites at which we work are inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain a safe work environment, we may incur losses and lose business.\nMany of our customers, particularly in the oil and gas and chemical industries, require their inspectors and other contractors working at their facilities to have good safety records because of the inherent danger at these sites. If our employees are injured at the work place, we could incur costs for the injuries and lost productivity. In addition, safety records are impacted by the number and amount of workplace incidents involving a contractor\u2019s employees. If our safety record is not within the levels required by our customers, or compares unfavorably to our competitors, we could lose business, be prevented from working at certain facilities or suffer other adverse consequences, all of which could negatively impact our business, revenues, reputation and profitability.\nIf our software or system produces inaccurate information or are incompatible with the systems used by our customers and\nmake us unable to successfully provide our solutions, it could lead to a loss of revenues and customers.\nOur software and systems are complex and, accordingly, may contain undetected errors or failures. Software or system defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording, reporting or display of information related to our asset protection solutions. Any such failures, defects and inaccurate data may prevent us from successfully providing our asset protection solutions, which could result in lost revenues. Software or system defects or inaccurate data may lead to customer dissatisfaction and could cause our customers to seek to hold us liable for any damages incurred. As a result, we could lose customers, our reputation may be harmed and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently serve a commercial, and industrial customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware, software solutions and operating systems. Our asset protection solutions need to interface with these systems in order to gather and assess data. Our business depends on the following factors, among others:\n\u2022our ability to integrate our technology with new and existing hardware and software systems, of either Mistras or a customer;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate and support new standards, especially internet-based standards; and\n\u2022our ability to integrate additional software modules under development by either Mistras or a customer, with our existing technology and operational processes.\nIf we are unable to adequately address any of these factors, our results of operations and prospects for growth and profitability\nwould be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of trained certified technicians, engineers and scientists at competitive wages, our operational performance may be harmed and our costs may increase.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of trained certified technicians, engineers and scientists at competitive wages. The demand for such employees fluctuates as the demand for NDT and inspection services fluctuates. When the demand for qualified technicians increases, we will often experience increased labor costs, which we may not recover in the amounts we can charge our customers. The markets for our products and services require us to use personnel trained and certified in accordance with standards set by domestic or international standard-setting bodies, such as the American Society of Non-Destructive Testing or the American Petroleum Institute. Because of the limited supply of these certified technicians, we expend substantial resources maintaining in-house training and certification programs. If we fail to attract sufficient new personnel or fail to motivate and retain our current personnel, our ability to perform under existing contracts and orders or to pursue new business may be harmed, preventing us from growing our business or causing us to lose customers and revenues, and the costs of performing such contracts and orders may increase, which would likely reduce our margins.\nWe operate in competitive markets and if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenues and our margins could decline.\nWe face strong competition from NDT and a variety of niche asset protection providers, both larger and smaller than we are. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model or develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer. Some of our competitors are business units of companies substantially larger than us and could attempt to combine asset protection solutions into an integrated offering to customers who already purchase other types of products or services from them. Our competitors may offer asset protection solutions at lower prices than ours in order to attempt to gain market share. Smaller niche competitors with small customer bases could be aggressive in their pricing in order to retain customers. These competitive factors could reduce our market share, revenues and profits.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to develop new asset protection solutions, increase the functionality of our current offerings and meet the needs and demands of our customers.\nThe market for asset protection solutions is impacted by technological change, uncertain product lifecycles, shifts in customer demands and evolving industry standards and regulations. If we fail to execute effective business strategies, or fail to successfully develop and market new asset protection solutions that comply with present or emerging industry regulations and technology standards our competitive standing and results could suffer. Also, new regulations or technology standards could increase our cost of doing business.\nFrom time to time, our customers have requested greater value and functionality in our solutions. As part of our strategy to enhance our asset protection solutions and grow our business, we continue to make investments in the research and development of new technologies, inspection tools and methodologies. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to design new, competitive and broader asset protection solutions, enhance our current solutions and provide new, value-added services. Many traditional NDT and inspection services are subject to price competition by our customers. Accordingly, the need to demonstrate our value-added services is becoming more important. Developing new solutions will require continued investment, and we may experience unforeseen technological or operational challenges. In addition, our asset protection software is complex and can be expensive to develop, and new software and software enhancements can require long development and testing periods. If we are unable to develop new asset protection solutions or enhancements that meet market demands on a timely basis, including against possible alternative products developed and marketed by our competitors, we may experience a loss of customers or otherwise be likely to lose opportunities to earn revenues and to gain customers or access to markets, and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nEven if we develop new solutions, if our customers, or potential customers, do not see the value our solutions have over competing products and services, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, because the asset protection solutions industry is evolving, we could lose insight into trends that may be emerging, which would further harm our competitive position by making it difficult to predict and respond to customer needs. If the market for our asset protection solutions does not continue to develop, our ability to grow our business would be limited and we might not be able to maintain profitability. If we cannot convince our customers of the advantages and value of our advanced NDT services, we could lose large contracts or suffer lower profit margin.\nThe seasonal nature of our business reduces our revenues and profitability in the winter and summer and related cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal. The fall and spring revenues are typically higher than our revenues in the winter and summer because demand for our asset protection solutions from the oil and gas as well as the fossil and nuclear power industries increases during their non-peak production periods. For instance, U.S. refineries\u2019 non-peak periods are generally in the fall, when they are retooling to produce more heating oil for winter, and in the spring, when they are retooling to produce more gasoline for summer. As a result of these trends, we generally have reduced cash flows in the fall and spring, as collections of receivables lag behind revenues, normally requiring us to increase our borrowings under our credit agreement. In addition, most of our operating expenses, such as employee compensation and property rental expense, are relatively fixed over the short term. Moreover, our spending levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues. As a result, if revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter. We expect that the impact of seasonality will continue.\nOur business, and the industries we currently serve, are currently subject to governmental regulation, and may become subject to modified or new government regulation that may negatively impact our ability to market our asset protection solutions.\nWe incur substantial costs in complying with various government regulations and licensing requirements. For example, the transportation and overnight storage of radioactive materials used in providing certain of our asset protection solutions such as radiography are subject to regulation under federal and state laws and licensing requirements. Our Services segment is currently licensed to handle radioactive materials by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), more than 20 state regulatory agencies and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. If we allegedly fail to comply with these regulations, we may be investigated and incur significant legal expenses associated with such investigations, and if we are found to have violated these regulations, we may be fined or lose one or more of our licenses or permits, which would prevent or restrict our ability to provide radiography services. In addition, while we are investigated, we may be required to suspend work on the projects associated with our alleged noncompliance, resulting in loss of profits or customers, and damage to our reputation. Many of our customers have strict requirements concerning safety or loss time occurrences and if we are unable to meet these requirements it could result in lost revenues. In the future, governmental agencies may seek to change current regulations or impose additional regulations on our business. Any modified or new government regulation applicable to our current or future asset protection solutions may negatively impact the marketing and provision of those solutions and increase our costs of providing these solutions and have a corresponding adverse effect on our margins.\nAdditionally, greenhouse gases that result from human activities, including burning of fossil fuels, have been the focus of increased scientific and political scrutiny and are being subjected to various legal requirements. International agreements, national laws, state laws and various regulatory schemes limit or otherwise regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, and additional restrictions are under consideration by different governmental entities. We derive a significant amount of revenues\nand profits from such industries, including oil and gas, power generation and transmission, and chemicals processing. Such regulations could negatively impact our customers, which could negatively impact the market for the services and products we provide. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on certification of our NDT solutions by industry standards-setting bodies. We and/or our subsidiaries currently have International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 certification, ISO 14001:2004 certification and OHSAS 18001:2007 certification. In addition, we currently have Nadcap (formerly National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) and similar certifications for certain of our locations. We continually review our NDT solutions for compliance with the requirements of industry specification standards and the Nadcap special processes quality requirements. However, if we fail to maintain our ISO, Nadcap or other certifications, our business may be harmed because our customers generally require that we have these certifications before they purchase our NDT solutions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA significant stockholder has significant influence over the direction of our business. The concentrated ownership of our common stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nDr. Sotirios J. Vahaviolos, our founder and Executive Chairman, owns approximately 29% of our outstanding common stock, and his three adult children own an additional 6%, in the aggregate. As a result, Dr. Vahaviolos has significant control over our Company and has the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other shareholders with differing interests from Dr. Vahaviolos.\nOur stock price could fluctuate for numerous reasons, including variations in our results.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may be the best indicators of our business. You should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. Our revenues and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any future period. Our failure to meet these expectations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially. Our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary depending on a number of factors, including those listed previously under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d In addition, the price of our common stock is subject to general economic, market, industry, and competitive conditions, the risk factors discussed below and numerous other conditions outside of our control.\nWe currently have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. To the extent we do not pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause the market price for our common stock to decline even if our business is doing well.\nFuture sales by us or by our existing shareholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of our equity securities. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of shares of our common stock, or the perception of such sales or issuances, would have on the market price of our common stock. We currently have approximately 170 million shares of common stock available for issuance.\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws and of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\n\u2022allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting by prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which may otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and limit the right to call special meetings of stockholders to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of directors or the Secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than 35% of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur credit agreement contains financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our credit agreement, we may be required to repay indebtedness to our existing lenders, which may harm our liquidity.\nOur credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we fail to comply with these covenants, the lenders could prevent us from borrowing under our credit agreement, require us to pay all amounts outstanding, require that we cash collateralize letters of credit issued under the credit agreement and restrict us from making acquisitions. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we then may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We believe that it is probable, based on the amended covenants to the credit agreement, that we will be able to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement and that sufficient credit remains available under the credit agreement to meet our liquidity needs. However, due to the uncertainties being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant volatility in oil prices, and volatility in the aerospace production, such matters cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur current credit agreement also imposes restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, such as creating liens, making certain investments, incurring more debt, disposing of certain property, paying dividends and making distributions and entering into a new line of business. While these restrictions have not impeded our business operations to date, if our plans change, these restrictions could be burdensome or require that we pay fees to have the restrictions waived. In addition, due to our current debt levels and restrictions related to the debt covenants in our credit facility, we do not expect to make any acquisitions in 2022 other than small acquisitions with the banks\u2019 approval.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the Company's business and operations during 2020, however our business and operations have rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels during 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to cause disruption and volatility in domestic and international markets and in the businesses and operations of our customers. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our customers have been and could continue to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in supply and demand, which has led to delays and could lead to defaults on collections of receivables from them. Such continued delays could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we have recovered during 2021 from most of the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, we are unable to predict the nature or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect the pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow and results of operations in the future. If the pandemic continues longer or in a manner more adverse that expected, or has a greater adverse impact on our customers, our financial conditions could be adversely impacted and we may encounter difficulties meeting the financial covenants in our credit agreement.\nDeteriorations in economic conditions in certain markets or other factors may cause us to recognize additional impairment charges for our goodwill.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company\u2019s market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Over the same period, the equity value of the Company\u2019s peer group, and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility. In addition, oil prices had dropped significantly. These declines were driven in large part by the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic events such as the geopolitical tensions between OPEC and Russia. Based on these factors, the Company concluded that multiple triggering events occurred and, accordingly, an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed for each reporting unit as of March 31, 2020.\nBased upon the results of the interim quantitative goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $77.1 million, which included $57.2 million in the services reporting unit within the Services segment, and $19.3 million in the European reporting unit and $0.6 million in the Brazilian reporting unit, both within the International segment.\nWhile we have significantly recovered during 2021, future deterioration in industry or economic conditions in which we operate, including disruptions in Europe or elsewhere as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, disruptions to our business, not effectively integrating acquired businesses, or other factors, may cause additional impairment charges to our goodwill in future periods.\nWe may face risks regarding our information technology and security.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We rely upon information technology systems to operate many parts of our business. We routinely collect, store and transmit large amounts of sensitive or confidential information, including data from the results of our testing and inspections. We deploy and operate various technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such sensitive or confidential information. Furthermore, as we automate more of our inspection process and procedures, including through the use of Mistras Digital, we become more vulnerable to security breaches and other system disruptions. In addition, we rely on third parties for significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d and others. Due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. The occurrence or perception of security breaches in connection with our asset protection solutions or our customers\u2019 concerns about internet security or the security of our solutions, whether warranted or not, would likely harm our reputation and business, inhibit market acceptance of our asset protection solutions and cause us to lose customers, any of which would harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, much of our computer and communications hardware is located at a single facility. We have a back-up data-center and storage in a different geographic area. Should a natural disaster or some other event occur that damages our primary data center or significantly disrupts its operation, such as human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events, we could suffer temporary interruption of key functions and capabilities before the back-up facility is fully operational.\nWe are subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. In addition to GDPR, many states in the U.S. and provinces in Canada have enacted, or are considering, data privacy requirements similar to GDPR, and thus we will need to ensure our procedures comply with these various state laws. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships.\nEvents such as natural disasters, industrial accidents, epidemics, pandemics, war and acts of terrorism, and adverse weather conditions could disrupt our business or the business of our customers, which could significantly harm our operations, financial results and cash flow.\nOur operations and those of our customers are susceptible to the occurrence of catastrophic events outside our control, which may include events like epidemics, pandemics and other health crises, severe weather conditions, industrial accidents, and acts of war and terrorism, to name a few. We continue to actively monitor the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed upon Russia in order to assess impacts to our customers and our operations. At this time, we do not believe there is a material impact on our operations, however the future impact of the conflict, and sanctions imposed, are uncertain.\nAny such events could cause a serious business disruption that reduces our customers\u2019 need or interest in purchasing our asset protection solutions. In the past, such events have resulted in order cancellations and delays because customer equipment, facilities or operations have been damaged, or are not then operational or available. A large portion of our customer base has operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which is subject to hurricanes and tropical storms. Hurricane-related disruptions to our customers\u2019 operations have adversely affected our revenues in the past. Such events in the future may result in substantial delays in the provision of solutions to our customers and the loss of valuable equipment. In addition, our results can be adversely impacted by severe winter weather conditions, which can result in lost workdays and temporary closures of customer facilities or outdoor projects. Safety measures have been taken in an attempt to protect our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, these events could disrupt commodity prices or financial markets or have other negative macroeconomic impacts, such as those being caused by COVID-19 coronavirus or the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which could harm our business.\nIf we lose key members of our senior management team upon whom we are dependent, we may be less effective in managing our operations and may have more difficulty achieving our strategic objectives.\nOur future success depends to a considerable degree upon the availability, contributions, vision, skills, experience and effort of our senior management team. We have in place various compensation programs, such as an annual cash incentive program, equity incentive program and a severance policy, each designed to incentivize and retain our key senior managers. At this time, we do not have any reason to believe that we may lose the services of any of these key persons in the foreseeable future and we believe our compensation programs will help us retain these individuals. We believe we have sufficient depth in our executive management to continue our success if we were to lose the services of an executive. However, an unplanned loss or interruption of the service of numerous key members of our senior management team could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could significantly reduce our ability to manage our operations and implement our strategy.\nIntellectual property may impact our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon the maintenance and protection of the intellectual property related to our asset protection solutions. Patent protection is unavailable for certain aspects of the technology and operational processes important to our business and any patent or patent applications, trademarks or copyrights held by us or to be issued to us, may not adequately protect us. To date, we have relied principally on copyright, trademark and trade secrecy laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, and more recently, patent protection, to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, we have not obtained confidentiality agreements from all our customers and vendors. Although we obligate our employees to confidentiality, we cannot be certain that these obligations will be honored or enforceable in all circumstances.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, which might not be available.\nWe intend to continue making investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new, or enhance our current, asset protection solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our current stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Our current credit facility meets our current needs, except that due to our current debt levels, the facility limits our ability to make acquisitions without the banks' approval until our debt ratio improves. If we were to secure other debt financing in the future, it could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, no assurance can be given that adequate or acceptable financing will be available to us, in which case we may not be able to grow our business, including through acquisitions, or respond to business challenges.", "PERMNO": 93065, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "MG"}
