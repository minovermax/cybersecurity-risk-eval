{"cik": "1533924", "company": "Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our other public filings, press releases and discussions with our management actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are the known material risk factors facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us or our operations.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Gas Industry and Our Business\nDue to reduced commodity prices and lower operating cash flows, coupled with substantial interest payments, there is doubt about our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through 2016 and our ability to make interest payments in respect of our indebtedness.\nThe Company's decisions on capital structure, hedging and drilling are based upon widely available information of anticipated future commodity pricing and expected economic conditions. The unexpected substantial decrease in oil and gas prices that began in the second half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and into 2016 has resulted in materially lower operating cash flows than expected. The Company's hedging contracts helped to mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices during 2015 as the Company received cash settlements of these derivatives of $167.7 million, which comprised 78.6% of our cash provided by operations during 2015. However, all of the Company's hedging contracts expired during 2015, and as a result, the Company will not receive any cash derivative settlements for 2016 or future periods, which will materially lower cash provided by operations in those future periods as compared to its historical operating cash flows.\nThe Company has substantial interest payment obligations over the next twelve months related to its debt. As of December 31, 2015, payments due on contractual obligations during the next twelve months were approximately $188.0 million. This includes approximately $179.5 million of interest payments on the Company's long-term debt and other operating expenses such as fixed drilling commitments and operating leases. The Company's next scheduled interest payment is April 1, 2016 for $15.8 million to the holders of the 2020 Senior Notes and the Company is currently evaluating whether such interest payment will be made. If the payment is not made by April 1, 2016, the Company would have 30 days to cure such payment default before an event of default occurs.\nIn February 2016, the Company borrowed approximately $249.2 million under its Credit Facility, which represented the remaining undrawn amount that was available under the Credit Facility and as a result, as of February 9, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $335.7 million.\nAs a result of the sustained commodity price decline and its substantial debt burden, the Company believes that forecasted cash and available credit capacity will not be sufficient to meet commitments as they come due over the next twelve months, and it will not be able to remain in compliance with current debt covenants unless it is able to successfully increase liquidity or deleverage. The uncertainty associated with the ability to meet commitments as they come due or to repay outstanding debt raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's long-term debt is reflected as a current liability in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. The classification as a current obligation is based on the uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in its Credit Facility and the related cross default/cross acceleration provisions contained in the Company's Senior Notes (as defined below).\nIn order to increase the Company's liquidity to levels sufficient to meet the Company's commitments, the Company is currently undertaking a number of actions, including minimizing capital expenditures, aggressively managing working capital and further reducing its recurring operating expenses. The Company believes that even after taking these actions, it will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its debt service obligations, meet other financial obligations, and comply with its debt\ncovenants. The Company has engaged financial and legal advisors to assist with analyzing various strategic alternatives to address its liquidity and capital structure, among other things. The Company believes a filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may provide the most expeditious manner in which to effect a capital structure solution. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to restructure its capital structure on terms acceptable to the Company and its creditors, or at all.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs mentioned in the risk factor immediately above, we have substantial debt obligations and may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout 2016. As a result, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanied our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 also contained an explanatory paragraph regarding a projected debt covenant violation and resulting lack of liquidity raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; however, we obtained a waiver to the Credit Facility waiving any default as a result of receiving such explanatory paragraph in 2014. We have not received a similar waiver from our Credit Facility for the explanatory paragraph to our 2015 independent registered public accounting firm report. As a result, we are in default under our Credit Facility. A failure to cure this default within 30 days will result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under the Credit Facility. If the lenders under our Credit Facility accelerate the loans outstanding thereunder, we will then also be in default under the under the indentures governing our Senior Notes, in which case the lenders under the indentures governing the Senior Notes could accelerate the repayment thereof.\nIf lenders, and subsequently noteholders, accelerate the Company's outstanding indebtedness, it will become immediately due and payable and the Company will not have sufficient liquidity to repay those amounts. If we are unable to reach an agreement with our creditors prior to any of the above described accelerations, we could be required to immediately file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe Company's long-term debt with maturities summarized in Note 9 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is reflected as a current liability in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. The classification as a current liability is based on the uncertainty regarding our ability to cure the event of default discussed above and to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in our Credit Facility and cross default/cross acceleration provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Notes.\nOur substantial indebtedness, current liquidity profile and potential to seek restructuring transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, current liquidity profile and potential to seek restructuring transactions may result in uncertainty about our business and cause, among other things:\n\u2022 difficulty retaining, attracting or replacing key employees;\n\u2022 employees to be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities; and,\n\u2022 our suppliers, vendors, hedge counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThese events may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe recent declines in oil and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and, to a lesser extent, NGLs and natural gas, heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current economic and geopolitical conditions. The spot oil prices during 2015 ranged from a high of $61.36 to a low of $34.55 per Bbl and the spot natural gas prices during 2015 ranged from a high of $3.32 to a low of $1.63 per MMBtu. Through February 22, 2016, commodity prices have continued to be depressed and volatile relative to past years, with spot oil prices ranging from a high of $36.81 to a low of $26.19 per Bbl and the spot natural gas prices ranging from a high of $2.54 to a low of $1.78 per MMBtu. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 political conditions in or affecting other oil, NGL and natural gas- producing countries;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022 localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 foreign, domestic and local governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022 speculation as to the future price of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil, NGLs and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022 price and availability of competitors' supplies of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nThe majority of our oil and NGL production and a portion of our gas production is currently sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12-month) contracts at market based prices. The speed and severity of the decline in oil prices during 2015 and the continued lower prices in the first quarter of 2016 has adversely affected our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. If oil, NGL and natural gas prices continue to deteriorate, we anticipate that the borrowing base under our Credit Facility, which is redetermined semi-annually, may be reduced. Lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial and extended decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations. This may result in our having to make further significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, this low commodity price environment and price volatility may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nWe may be required to make deficiency payments under our Credit Facility because of a decrease in our borrowing base and may be unable to obtain funding in the capital markets on terms we find acceptable.\nHistorically, we have used our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility to fund our capital expenditures and have relied on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions or to refinance debt obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we have a Credit Facility with a borrowing base of $252.0 million, $249.2 of which was available to use. In February 2016, the Company borrowed approximately $249.2 million under the Credit Facility, which represented the remaining undrawn amount that was available under the Credit Facility. The borrowing base under our Credit Facility is subject to semiannual redeterminations in April and October and up to one additional time per six month period following each scheduled borrowing base redetermination, as may be requested by us or the administrative agent, acting on behalf of lenders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding loans and other obligations. Should prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas remain weak or deteriorate, if we have a downward revision in estimates of our proved reserves, or if we sell oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, our borrowing base may be reduced. Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our available liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under the facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within 30 days or in six equal monthly installments thereafter, at our election. We may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory deficiency principal prepayments required under our Credit Facility, which could result in an event of default.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our Credit Facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination, or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. Since the process for determining the borrowing base under our Credit Facility involves evaluating the estimated value of some of our oil and natural gas properties using pricing models determined by the lenders at that time, a decline in those prices used, or further downward reductions of our reserves, likely will result in a redetermination of our borrowing base and a decrease in the available borrowing amount at the time of the next scheduled redetermination. In such case, we would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base.\nVolatility in the public and private capital markets may make it more difficult to obtain funding. The cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, imposed tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms similar to existing debt or at all, or, in some instances, reduced or ceased to provide any new funding. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required, or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance our debt obligations as they come due, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nOur level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have $293.6 million in 10.75% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2020 (the \"2020 Senior Notes\"), $347.7 million in 9.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Senior Notes\" together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the \"Unsecured Notes\"), $625.0 million in Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the \"Second Lien Notes\") and $529.7 million in Third Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the \"Third Lien Notes\" together with the Second Lien Notes and the Unsecured Notes, \"the Senior Notes\") outstanding, which includes $5.5 million of paid in kind accrued interest. As of December 31, 2015, we had not drawn down on our Credit Facility. However, subsequent to year-end, we drew down the full capacity of the Credit Facility of $249.2 million, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nOur current level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022 causing a significant portion of our cash flows to be used to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, such competitors may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022 causing our debt covenants to affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022 making it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require us to repay a portion of our then outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022 impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the indentures governing our Senior Notes.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, oil, NGL and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nOur Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes contain certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our future goals.\nOur Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes includes certain covenants that, among other things, restrict:\n\u2022 our ability to incur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022 issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022 pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022 make loans and investments;\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 enter into new lines of business.\nA breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes or under the Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under our Credit Facility would permit the lenders under the facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. These restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our Credit Facility may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders thereunder or their successors or assignees, such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If we were unable to repay such borrowings or interest, our lenders could proceed against their collateral. If the indebtedness under our Credit Facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to maintain compliance with certain financial ratio covenants of our outstanding indebtedness which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. If liquidity concerns are not addressed in the near-term, we may breach the leverage covenant of our Credit Facility which currently requires a maximum ratio of total senior indebtedness to EBITDA of not more than 1.0:1.0. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our financial covenants; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with such terms at all times in the future. Any failure to comply with the conditions and covenants in our Credit Facility that is not waived by our lenders or otherwise cured could lead to a termination of our Credit Facility, acceleration of all amounts due under our Credit Facility, or trigger cross-default provisions under other financing arrangements. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness impose on us.\nLiquidity concerns could result in a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit, increase our borrowing costs and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nThe trading level of our debt is expressed as a percentage of the par value of the outstanding debt obligation, and our various outstanding debt obligations are currently trading at significant discounts to their par value. As of February 26, 2016, our 2020 Senior Notes were trading at 3.5% of par value, our 2021 Senior Notes were trading at 3.5% of par value, our Second Lien Notes were trading at 27.0% of\npar value and our Third Lien Notes were trading at 5.5% of par value. The trading level or market value of our debt is based upon many factors, including expectations regarding the likelihood of future repayment and the amount recoverable in the event of a default, our ability to pay interest and the risk tolerance of each debt holder. As of February 26, 2016, although the principal balance of our total debt, excluding outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, was approximately $1.8 billion, the fair market value of our debt, based upon quoted trading prices, was approximately $0.2 billion.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, drilling and production activities. Our oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore or develop drilling locations or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through 2D and 3D seismic data, geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. The production and operating data that is available with respect to our operating areas based on modern drilling and completion techniques is relatively limited compared to trends where multiple operators have been active for a significant period of time. As a result, we face more uncertainty in evaluating data than operators in more developed trends. Our costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. In addition, the application of new techniques in these trends, such as high-graded stimulation designs and horizontal completions, may make it more difficult to accurately estimate these costs. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022 shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022 unexpected operational events;\n\u2022 ability to economically dispose of produced saltwater;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022 delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u2022 title problems;\n\u2022 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022 cost associated with developing and operating oil and gas properties.\nIn addition, our hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water. Regions where we operate have recently experienced drought conditions. These conditions could persist in the future, diminishing our access to water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing, whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions, could curtail our operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. If the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was run at current strip prices, our total estimated proved reserves would be significantly below the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2015.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nDue to the recent decrease in oil and natural gas prices and if prices continue to decrease, we will be required to take further write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties. Accordingly, we capitalize and amortize all productive and nonproductive costs directly associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Under the full cost method, the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes may not exceed the \"cost center ceiling\" which is equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10%, plus the costs of properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of the cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less related income tax effects. If the net capitalized costs exceed the cost center ceiling, we recognize the excess as an impairment of oil and gas properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.6 billion for the amount by which our net capitalized costs exceeded the cost center ceiling. This impairment does not impact cash flows from operating activities but does reduce our earnings and shareholders' equity. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and natural gas properties increases during periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. We could incur impairments of oil and natural gas properties in the future, particularly as a result of further declines in commodity prices.\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. Our hedges expired in 2015. As we choose not to replace those hedges, our cash flows from operations will be subjected to increased volatility.\nHistorically, we have entered into hedging transactions of our oil, NGL and natural gas production to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas. All of our existing hedges expired at December 31, 2015. As such, all of our current production will be sold at market prices, leaving us more exposed to the fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas and subjecting our cash flows from operations to increased volatility unless we enter into additional hedging transactions.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods historically and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $1.6 billion and $407.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this report may impede our ability to economically acquire and develop oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and estimated present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. See \"Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations\" for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must estimate production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. In addition, reserve estimates for properties that do not have a lengthy production history, including the areas in which we operate, are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories. There can be no assurance that analysis of previous production data relating to the Mississippian Lime or Anadarko Basins will accurately predict future production, development expenditures or operating expenses from wells drilled and completed using modern techniques. In addition, this data is partially based on vertically drilled wells, which may not accurately reflect production, development expenditures or operating expenses that may result from the application of horizontal drilling techniques.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe development of our undeveloped reserves in our areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nDevelopment of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, pursuant to existing SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. Accordingly, delays in the development of such reserves, increases in capital expenditures required to develop such reserves and changes in commodity prices may cause us to reclassify certain of our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, due to uncertainty around our ability to adequately finance the development of our proved undeveloped reserves over a five year period, 77,362 MBoe comprising $179.0 million of PV-10 value (at SEC pricing) of proved undeveloped reserves has been transferred and booked in the probable reserve category as of December 31, 2015.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nDrilling locations that we have identified may not yield oil, NGLs or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nWe describe some of our drilling locations and our plans to explore those drilling locations in this report. Our drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a location which is ready to drill to a location that will require substantial additional interpretation. It is extremely difficult to accurately predict with any level of certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production from or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. In sum, the cost of drilling, completing and operating any well is often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of leases for such locations. In addition, we may not be able to raise the amount of capital that would be necessary to drill a substantial portion of our identified drilling locations.\nOur management team has identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage and acreage currently under option. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, infrastructure and/or downstream constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our horizontal drilling activities are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and actual drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production. As a result, the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nRisks that we face while horizontally drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that we face while completing our horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these horizontal drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled in the Mississippian Lime and Anadarko Basin and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our horizontal drilling results in these trends are less than anticipated, the return on our investment in this area may not be as attractive as we anticipate. The value of our undeveloped acreage in this area could decline in the future.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use or its production, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition, water use or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. As further discussed in the risk factor below, new rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in\ncertain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in our operations. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater produced alongside our hydrocarbons, which could limit our ability to produce oil and gas economically and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe dispose of large volumes of saltwater produced alongside oil and natural gas in connection with our drilling and production operations pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, the applicable legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements.\nThere exists a growing concern that the injection of saltwater into belowground disposal wells contribute to seismic activity in certain areas, including Oklahoma and Texas, where we operate. For instance, on April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geologic Survey (\"OGS\") issued a document entitled \"Statement of Oklahoma Seismicity,\" in which the agency states \"[t]he OGS considers it very likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.\" In response to these concerns, regulators in some states , including Oklahoma and Texas, are pursuing initiatives designed to impose additional requirements in the permitting and operation of saltwater disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in 2014, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas, (\"Areas of Interest\") in the Arbuckle formation, requiring operators to monitor and record well pressure and discharge volume on a daily basis and further requiring operators of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 barrels per day or more of saltwater to conduct mechanical integrity testing. On March 25, 2015, the OGCD issued a directive, expanding the Areas of Interest for induced seismicity. Under the new directive, operators of 347 disposal wells located within the expanded Areas of Interest of the Arbuckle formation were given until April 18, 2015 to demonstrate that their wells were not disposing into or in communication with the crystalline basement rock underlying the Arkbuckle formation. Operators of wells in contact or communication with the basement rock were required to reduce the depth of, or \"plug back,\" those wells or, alternatively, to reduce disposal volume by 50 percent. On July 17, 2015, the OGCD issued another directive, further expanding the covered area to include an additional 211 disposal wells. Under this second directive, operators were given until August 14, 2015 to prove that they were not injecting below the Arbuckle formation or, as necessary, to plug back those wells in contact or communication with the crystalline basement rock, without the option of reducing disposal volume by 50 percent.\nOn November 19, 2015, the OGCD issued a directive to stop or reduce disposal volumes in the Cherokee-Carmen area, including 5 wells we currently operate. Most recently, on January 13, 2016, the OGCD announced a plan in response to recent earthquakes in the Fairview area of Oklahoma. The plan calls for changes to the operations of oil and gas wastewater disposal wells in the area that dispose into the Arbuckle formation. Under the plan, a total of 27 Arbuckle disposal wells will be required to reduce disposal volume. The plan will affect 7 disposal wells we currently operate in the Arbuckle formation. On February 16, 2016, the OGCD requested we curtail our wastewater disposal volumes by approximately 40%. We are currently in discussions with the OGCD regarding these matters and are working to mitigate any potential impact to our operations.\nIn Texas, effective on November 17, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted a new rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that requires, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If a permittee or a prospective permittee fails to demonstrate that the saltwater or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the Commission may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well.\nThe adoption and implementation of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, which could require the Company to cease operations at a substantial number of its oil and natural gas wells, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce oil and gas economically and, accordingly, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oilfield services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of frac crews, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on transportation by truck for our oil and condensate production, and our natural gas production depends on transportation facilities that are owned by third parties.\nWe transport all of our oil and condensate production by truck, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. Our natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas.\nThe disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance, capacity constraints, or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored or what prices will be charged. A total shut-in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than current market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flows.\nOur drilling and production programs may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to truck transportation, pipelines, gas gathering, transmission, storage and processing facilities to market our oil and gas production.\nThe marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the capacity and availability of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities. Access to such facilities is, in many respects, beyond our control. If these facilities were unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit and sell our oil and gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities, or lack of capacity on such facilities. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. Additionally we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as unauthorized releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including soil and groundwater contamination;\n\u2022 abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022 mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022 fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022 personal injuries and death; and\n\u2022 natural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022 injury or loss of life;\n\u2022 damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022 regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022 suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022 repair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully\ninsurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, or increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to drill our identified locations and pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent disruptions and continuing volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nThe inability of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil, NGL and natural gas receivables with several significant purchasers. Two purchasers accounted for 43% and 25%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. We generally do not require our purchasers to post collateral. The inability or failure of any of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny future derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nWe currently do not have any outstanding derivative instruments. However, to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, we have historically chosen to enter into derivative instruments at times for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production. We do not designate derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes, and we record all derivative instruments in our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, to the extent we enter into derivative instruments in the future, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments would expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022 production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022 the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022 there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for basis differentials.\nIn addition, any derivative arrangements in the future would likely limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nLarge competitors may be attracted to our core operating areas, which may increase our costs.\nOur operations in the Mississippian Lime formation in northwestern Oklahoma and the Anadarko Basin in Texas and Oklahoma may attract companies that have greater resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Their presence in our areas of operations may also restrict\nour access to, or increase the cost of, oil and natural gas infrastructure, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services, including fracking equipment and crews. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. See \"Business-Competition\" for additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate.\nThe volatility in commodity prices and business performance may affect our ability to retain key management. The loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We experienced significant management and board turnover in 2014, 2015 and early 2016. The loss of the services of additional members of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. Furthermore, if we are unable to find, hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe do not obtain title insurance and have not necessarily obtained drilling title opinions on all of our oil and natural gas properties. The existence of title deficiencies with respect to our oil and natural gas properties could reduce the value or render such properties worthless, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. A portion of our acreage is undeveloped leasehold acreage, which has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Frequently, as a result of title examinations, certain curative work may be required to correct identified title defects, and such curative work entails time and expense. Our inability or failure to cure title defects could render some locations undrillable or cause us to lose our rights to some or all production from some of our oil and natural gas properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if a comparable additional location to drill a development well cannot be identified.\nThe proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2016 and proposed legislation contain certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Obama administration's budget proposals for fiscal year 2016 contains numerous proposed tax changes, and from time to time, legislation has been introduced that would enact many of these proposed changes. The proposed budget and legislation would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently available to U.S. oil and gas companies. Among others, the provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling and development costs in the year incurred; repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for oil and gas properties; repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers. It is unclear whether any of these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. Should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes could increase, potentially significantly, after net operating losses are exhausted, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows and could reduce our drilling activities. We do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations that may cause us to incur substantial costs.\nFrom time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected, and in the future could affect, oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government, and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation.\nOur sales of oil and gas may expose us to extensive regulation.\nThe FERC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales, if any, of oil, NGLs and natural gas, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies.\nOur operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, regional, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to pollution and protection of the environment, including those governing the release or disposal of materials into the environment. Potentially applicable environmental laws include, but are not limited to, (i) the CERCLA, and analogous state laws, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal; (ii) the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), and analogous state laws, which regulate the discharge of waste and storm waters from some of our facilities; (iii) the CAA, and analogous state laws, which impose obligations related to air emissions, including emissions limits and permitting requirements; (iv) the RCRA, and analogous state laws, which impose requirements for the handling and disposal of solid or hazardous waste; (v) the Endangered Species Act, and analogous state laws, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered animal, fish and plant species; (vi) the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to study potential environmental impacts of a proposed federal action before it is approved; and (vii) OSHA, and analogous state laws, which establish certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, require the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas, impose specific standards for the plugging and abandoning of wells and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to prevent releases, manage wastewater discharges and control air emissions or perform remedial or other corrective actions at our wells and properties to\ncomply with the requirements of these environmental laws and regulations or the terms or conditions of permits issued pursuant to such requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, loss of our leases, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hazardous substances and wastes, as a result of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and because of historical operations and waste disposal practices at our leased, operated and owned properties. Spills or other releases of regulated substances, including such spills and releases that occur in the future, could expose us to material losses, expenditures and liabilities or remedial obligations under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Under certain of such laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and even if our operations met previous standards in the industry or complied with existing applicable laws at the time they were conducted.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, air emissions control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general in addition to our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. For example, in 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject certain oil and natural gas sources, including production operations, to regulation under the NSPS and the NESHAP programs that, among other things, require performance of green completions on certain fractured and re-fractured natural gas wells and establish specific requirements regarding emissions from certain production- related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In a more recent example, the EPA published a final rule on October 1, 2015 that reduces the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to between 65 and 70 ppb for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, the EPA's 2014 - 2016 National Enforcement Initiatives include \"Assuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws.\" According to the EPA's website, the EPA's goal is to \"address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment.\" The EPA has emphasized that this initiative will be focused on those areas of the country where energy extraction activities are concentrated, and the focus and nature of the enforcement activities will vary with the type of activity and the related pollution problem presented. This initiative could involve a large scale investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties or injunctive relief against us. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nBased on the EPA's determination that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish pre-construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or\ncriteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHGs from certain sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and a number of states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. For example, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced plans for the EPA to issue final standards in 2016 that would reduce methane emissions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, which could adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our oil and natural gas drilling and completion programs. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has issued final CAA regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; proposed in April 2015 effluent limit guidelines that saltwater from shale resource extraction operations must meet before discharging to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants (the final rule is expected to be issued in March 2016); and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing (the public comments period on the EPA's advance notice ended in September 2014, and a final notice of proposed rulemaking is expected in 2016) . Also, the BLM published a final rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in March of 2015. Compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production, which costs may be significant.\nFrom time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Moreover, some states, including Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations under certain circumstances. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, such as the State of New York announced in\nDecember 2014. In addition, local government may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. In addition, there are also certain governmental reviews underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices which could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to receive or renew the required permits and other approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nPerformance of our operations requires that we obtain and maintain numerous environmental, water access and land use permits and other approvals authorizing our regulated activities. We must renew these permits and approvals periodically, and the permits and approvals may be modified or revoked by the issuing agency. A decision by a governmental authority or other third party to deny, delay or restrictively condition the issuance of a new or renewed permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental, water access or land use permits and other approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.\nThe adoption of financial reform legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nCongress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. This legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Act, was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010 and requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may also require compliance with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require certain counterparties to derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure derivative contracts in the future and increase exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. In the future, if we are unable to use derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Our revenues could\ntherefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is even lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nIf we file for bankruptcy, there is a high likelihood that the shares of our existing common stock would be cancelled.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. As a result, if we were to file for bankruptcy, we believe that it is highly likely that the shares of our existing common stock could be cancelled if any bankruptcy proceedings and would be entitled to a limited recovery, if any.\nThe NYSE has delisted our common stock, which could have a substantial effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOn February 3, 2016, the NYSE delisted our stock due to non-compliance with minimum listing standards. As a result, our common stock now trades in the OTC Pink market under the ticker symbol \"MPOY.\" Securities traded in the OTC Pink market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market's perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay, and we are currently prohibited from paying, dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we are currently prohibited from making any cash dividends pursuant to the terms of our Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price greater than you paid for it.\nFirst Reserve holds a significant portion of our common stock. Their interests as equity holders may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders or our noteholders.\nFirst Reserve currently owns an economic interest in us through FR Midstates Interholding LP (\"FRMI\"), which owns approximately 25% of our shares of common stock and is controlled by First Reserve. Given their ownership level, First Reserve can have significant influence over our operations, can have representatives on our board of directors and have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that our shareholders may not view as beneficial.\nIn addition, we, FRMI and certain of our other stockholders have entered into a stockholders' agreement (the \"Stockholders' Agreement\") that permits FRMI the right to nominate three members of our board of directors so long as FRMI holds at least 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Upon the identification by our board of directors of an additional director nominee that our board of directors has affirmatively determined is independent pursuant to the listing standards of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, FRMI has agreed to cause one of its director nominees to resign if so requested by the Board. At and as of such time that FRMI holds less than 25% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, FRMI will have the right to nominate one member of our board of directors. The Stockholders' Agreement also requires the stockholders party thereto to take all necessary actions, including voting their shares of common stock, for the election of the FRMI nominees and the board's other nominees. In February 2016, FRMI's director nominees resigned from our board of directors and we currently have no nominees from FRMI serving as directors.\nAs a result of FRMI's equity, our ability to engage in financing transactions or other significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition, disposition or liquidation, may be limited. In connection with such transactions, conflicts of interest could arise between us and FRMI, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities, which could adversely affect our business or prospects.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and First Reserve and its affiliates, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. First Reserve is a private equity firm in the business of making investments in entities primarily in the global energy sector. As a result, First Reserve's existing and future portfolio companies which it controls may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to First Reserve or its affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than us and our subsidiaries) or business opportunities that such parties participate in or desire to participate in, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person shall be liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling stockholder or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires any such business opportunity, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless, in the case of any such person who is our director or officer, any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer.\nAs a result, First Reserve or its affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to First Reserve and its affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.", "PERMNO": 16442, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "AMPY"}
