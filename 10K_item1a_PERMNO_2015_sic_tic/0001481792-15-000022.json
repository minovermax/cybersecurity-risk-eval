{"cik": "1481792", "company": "Quad/Graphics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to Quad/Graphics' securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nQuad/Graphics operates in a highly competitive industry.\nQuad/Graphics operates primarily in the commercial print portion of the printing industry. The printing industry, with approximately 48,000 companies in the United States, is highly fragmented and competitive. The five largest printing companies account for approximately 20% of total commercial print industry annual revenue in the United States. Although there has been significant industry consolidation, particularly in the past decade, the largest 400 printers in the printing industry still only represent approximately half of the total industry revenue in the United States, according to the December 2014 Printing Impressions PI400. According to the August 2014 Printing in the U.S. IBISWorld Industry Report, the majority of commercial printers in the United States are privately owned and generate, on average, less than $35 million in annual revenue and approximately 70% of firms operating in the industry have fewer than 10 employees. As such, the Company competes for business not only with large and mid-sized printers, but also with smaller regional printers. In certain circumstances, due primarily to factors such as freight rates and client preference for local services, printers with better access to certain regions of a given country may be preferred by clients in such regions.\nIn recent years, the printing industry has experienced a reduction in demand for printed materials and overcapacity due to various factors including the great recession of 2008 and 2009, which severely impacted volumes and competition from alternative sources of communication, including email, the Web, electronic readers, interactive television and electronic retailing. The impacts of overcapacity and intense competition have led to continued downward pricing pressures. Printing industry revenues may continue to decrease in the future. Some of the industries that the Company services have been subject to consolidation efforts, leading to a smaller number of potential clients. Furthermore, if the smaller clients of Quad/Graphics are consolidated with larger companies using other printing companies, the Company could lose its clients to competing printing companies.\nThe printing industry is highly competitive and expected to remain so. Any failure on the part of the Company to compete effectively in the markets it serves could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and could require changes to the way it conducts its business or require it to reassess strategic alternatives involving its operations.\nSignificant downward pricing pressure and decreasing demand for printing services caused by factors outside of the Company's control may adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company has experienced significant downward pricing pressures for printing services in the past, and pricing for printing services has declined significantly in recent years. Such pricing may continue to decline from current levels. In addition, demand for printing services has decreased in recent years and may continue to decrease. Any increases in the supply of printing services or decreases in demand could cause prices to continue to decline, and prolonged periods of low prices, weak demand and/or excess supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business growth, results of operations and liquidity.\nQuad/Graphics may not be able to reduce costs and improve its operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive, Quad/Graphics will need to continue to improve its operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve its profitability. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs have and, in the future, may continue to result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology.\nThe impact of electronic media and similar technological changes including the substitution of printed products for digital content may continue to adversely affect the results of the Company's operations.\nThe media landscape is experiencing rapid change due to the impact of electronic media and digital content on printed products. Improvements in the accessibility and quality of digital media through the online distribution and hosting of media content, mobile technologies, e-reader technologies, electronic retailing and the digital distribution of documents and data has resulted and may continue to result in increased consumer substitution. Continued consumer acceptance of such digital media, as an alternative to print materials, is uncertain and difficult to predict and may decrease the demand for the Company's printed products, result in reduced pricing for its printing services and additional excess capacity in the printing industry and adversely affect the results of the Company's operations.\nFuture declines in economic conditions may adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nIn general, demand for the Company's products and services is highly related to general economic conditions in the markets Quad/Graphics clients serve. Declines in economic conditions in the United States or in other countries in which the Company operates may adversely impact the Company's financial results and these impacts may be material. Because such declines in demand are difficult to predict, the Company or the industry may have increased excess capacity as a result. An increase in excess capacity has resulted and may continue to result in declines in prices for the Company's products and services. In addition, a prolonged decline in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook has and could further reduce the demand in the printing industry. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending have resulted, and may in the future result, in decreased revenue, operating margin, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. The Company has experienced, and expects to experience in the future, excess capacity and lower demand due to economic factors affecting consumers' and businesses' spending behavior. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for the Company to predict results of operations, financial position and cash flows and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation and deployment of capital.\nQuad/Graphics' business depends substantially on customer contract renewals and/or customer retention. Any contract non-renewals, renewals on different terms and conditions or decline in the Company's customer retention or expansion could materially adversely affect Quad/Graphics' results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue from long-term contracts with significant clients. If the Company loses significant clients, is unable to renew such contracts on similar terms and conditions, or at all, or is not awarded new long-term contracts with important clients in the future, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by its clients. Some of the Company's clients are highly leveraged or otherwise subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Even if the Company's credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, the Company may experience financial losses and loss of future business if its clients become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise are unable to pay the Company for its work performed. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by clients could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the industries in which the Company's clients operate are seeing consolidation. When client consolidation occurs, it is possible that the volume of work performed by the Company for a client after the consolidation will be less than it was before the consolidation or that the client's work will be completely moved to competitors. Any such reduction or loss of work could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Quad/Graphics fails to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, investment opportunities or other significant transactions, it may adversely affect the Company's future results.\nAs part of Quad/Graphics growth strategy, the Company may pursue acquisitions of, investment opportunities in or other significant transactions with companies that are complementary to the Company's business. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, the Company must identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, successfully complete the transaction, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees. Quad/Graphics may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition or investment opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions. Even if the Company identifies and completes suitable corporate transactions, the Company may not be able to successfully address inherent risks in a timely manner, or at all. These inherent risks include, among other things: (1) failure to successfully integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services and maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures; (2) substantial unanticipated integration costs; (3) loss of key employees including those of the acquired business; (4) diversion of management's attention from other operations; (5) failure to retain the clients of the acquired business; (6) failure to achieve any projected synergies and performance targets; (7) additional debt and/or assumption of known or unknown liabilities; (8) potential dilutive issuances of equity securities; and (9) a write-off of goodwill, client lists, other intangibles and amortization of expenses. If the Company fails to successfully integrate an acquisition, the Company may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and Quad/Graphics future results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the diversion of management's attention from the Company's other operations due to these acquisitions and integration effort could adversely affect its business and have a negative financial impact.\nChanges in postal rates, postal regulations and postal services may adversely impact demand for Quad/Graphics' products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of the cost structures of many of the Company's clients and potential clients. Postal rate changes and USPS regulations that result in higher overall costs can influence the number of pieces that these clients will be willing to mail. In addition to the actual costs of postage, Quad/Graphics clients' mail must meet specific design standards established by the USPS. At times, these design standards place an undue burden on the mailer and may increase compliance costs. Any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, integrated distribution with the postal service is an important component of the Company's business. Any material change in the current service levels provided by the postal service could impact the demand that clients have for print services. The USPS has reported net losses in the last six fiscal years and has estimated these losses will continue into the near future and, as a result, has come under increased pressure to adjust its postal rates and service levels. Late in 2013, the USPS went before the Postal Regulatory Commission (\"PRC\") and requested to increase postage due to \"exigent\" circumstances. The PRC granted the USPS with the authority to increase rates through a temporary two-year surcharge. This action by the USPS resulted in postage rates being increased by 6.0% on January 26, 2014. The increase includes the normal and expected annual Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") increase of 1.7% and an additional 4.3% temporary exigency-based increase. This increase may cause the Company's clients to reduce mail volumes and explore the use of alternative methods for delivering their products; such as continued diversion to the Internet and other alternative media channels. The USPS has filed a lawsuit challenging the legal authority of the PRC to limit the increase to a two-year surcharge. Instead, the USPS is arguing that the exigent rate increase ought to be made a permanent part of the base postage rates going forward. A permanent increase will increase postage costs in the coming years.\nThe Company's clients enjoy significant postal savings due to \u201cwork-share\u201d discounts that provide incentives to co-mail and place product as far down the mail-stream as possible. Discounts are earned as a result of less handling of the mail and therefore lower costs for the USPS. Due to the overall financial struggles of the USPS, consideration has been given to eliminating or scaling back these discounts. If the USPS were to take this action, the net impact will be to effectively increase postage rates for the Company's clients. Quad/Graphics has made substantial investments in co-mailing technology and equipment. If the incentives to co-mail are eliminated or scaled back, the value of these investments would be significantly reduced. Co-mailing has the added benefit that Quad/Graphics maintains control over the product for as long as possible and therefore increases the timeliness of the Company's clients\u2019 delivery needs. Lastly, if the \u201cwork-share\u201d discounts were eliminated or scaled back and the USPS took control of the Company's clients'\nproducts earlier, significant amounts of time would be lost which would lead to uncertainty in the timing of the clients' product reaching the ultimate end consumer.\nDue in large part to the uncertainty of the financial sustainability of the USPS, the USPS has considered changing their delivery schedule from six days per week to five days per week. This change would diminish the value of the mail for some customers as there will be fewer opportunities to communicate with their target consumers.\nThe USPS has taken steps to consolidate their network of processing facilities to reflect the realities of lower mail volumes throughout the country. While these consolidations are needed, it may result in longer distances that the mail must travel and may result in delays in final \"in-home\" delivery. In addition, the consolidation of the USPS\u2019 network has resulted in a change in the location of the appropriate entry point into the postal service. At times this has resulted in some confusion as to where the appropriate entry point is, which, in turn, may result in erroneous shipments that may impact the timeliness of the final delivery to the consumer.\nQuad/Graphics entry into additional markets increases the complexity of the Company's business, and if the Company is unable to successfully adapt its business processes as required by these new markets, the Company will be at a competitive disadvantage and its ability to grow will be adversely affected.\nAs the Company expands its product line to provide additional marketing and publishing channels, the overall complexity of the Company's business increases at an accelerated rate and the Company becomes subject to different market dynamics. The new markets into which Quad/Graphics is expanding, or may expand, may have different characteristics from the markets in which the Company currently competes. These different characteristics may include, among other things, demand volume requirements, demand seasonality, product generation development rates, client concentrations and performance and compatibility requirements. The Company's failure to make the necessary adaptations to its business model to address these different characteristics, complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\nQuad/Graphics may be adversely affected by increases in its operating costs, including the cost and availability of raw materials, labor-related costs, fuel and other energy costs and freight rates.\nPaper, ink and energy are the primary raw materials used by the Company in the operation of its business. The price of such raw materials has fluctuated over time and has caused fluctuations in the Company's net sales and cost of sales. This volatility may continue and Quad/Graphics may experience increases in the costs of its raw materials in the future as prices in the overall paper, ink and energy markets are expected to remain beyond its control.\nIn general, the Company has been able to pass along increases in the cost of paper to many of its clients. If the Company is unable to continue to pass along increases in the cost of paper to its clients, future increases in paper costs would adversely affect its margins and profits. If Quad/Graphics passes along increases in the cost of paper and the price of the Company's products and services increases as a result, client demand could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact Quad/Graphics' financial performance.\nQuad/Graphics is dependent upon the vendors within the Company's supply chain to maintain a steady supply of inventory, parts and materials. Many of the Company's products are dependent upon a limited number of vendors, and significant disruptions could adversely affect operations. Under recent market conditions, including the tightening credit market, it is possible that one or more of the Company's vendors will be unable to fulfill their operating obligations due to financial hardships, liquidity issues or other reasons related to the prolonged market recovery.\nDue to the significance of paper in the Company's business, it is dependent on the availability of paper. In periods of high demand, certain paper grades have been in short supply, including grades used in the Company's business. In addition, during periods of tight supply, many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based upon historical purchase levels of customers. Although Quad/Graphics generally has not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of paper, unforeseen developments in the overall paper markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper and could adversely affect the Company's revenues or profits.\nIn addition, the Company may not be able to resell waste paper and other by-products or the prices received for their sale may decline substantially.\nThe Company has less frequently been able to pass along increases in the cost of ink and energy to its clients. If the Company is unable to pass along increases in the cost of ink and energy, future increases in these items would adversely affect its margins and profits. If Quad/Graphics is able to pass along increases in the costs of ink and energy and the price of the Company's products and services increases as a result, client demand could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact Quad/Graphics' financial performance.\nLabor represents a significant component of the cost structure of Quad/Graphics. Increases in wages, salaries and benefits, such as medical, dental, pension and other post-retirement benefits, may impact the Company's financial performance. Changes in interest rates, investment returns or the regulatory environment may impact the amounts the Company will be required to contribute to the pension plans that it sponsors and may affect the solvency of these pension plans. In addition, Quad/Graphics may be unable to retain employees or labor may not be adequately available in locations in which the Company operates, which could negatively impact the Company's financial performance.\nFreight rates and fuel costs also represent a significant component of the Company's cost structure. In general, the Company has been able to pass along increases in the cost of freight and fuel to many of its clients. If the Company is not able to pass along a substantial portion of increases in freight rates or in the price of fuel, future increases in these items would adversely impact the Company's margin and profits. If Quad/Graphics passes along increases in the cost of freight and fuel and the price of the Company's products and services increases as a result, client demand could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact Quad/Graphics' financial performance.\nQuad/Graphics and its facilities are subject to various consumer protection and privacy laws and regulations (including cyber-security laws), and will become subject to additional laws and regulations in the future. If Quad/Graphics' efforts to comply with such laws or protect the security of information are unsuccessful, any failure may subject the Company to material liability, require it to incur material costs or otherwise adversely affect its results of operations as a result of compliance with such laws, costly enforcement actions and private litigation.\nThe nature of the Quad/Graphics business includes the receipt and storage of information about the Company's clients, vendors and the end-users of Quad/Graphics products and services. Quad/Graphics and its clients are subject to various United States and foreign consumer protection, information security (including cyber-security), data privacy and \"do not mail\" requirements at the federal, states, provincial and local levels. Quad/Graphics is subject to many legislative and regulatory laws and regulations around the world concerning data protection and privacy. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often fluid and uncertain. The Company may not be able to anticipate techniques used to gain access to Quad/Graphics systems or facilities, the Company's clients systems, vendor systems or implement adequate prevention measures. Moreover, unauthorized parties may attempt to access Quad/Graphics systems or facilities, the Company's clients systems or vendor systems through fraud or deception. To the extent that the Company or its clients become subject to additional or more stringent requirements or that the Company is not successful in its efforts to comply with existing requirements or protect the security of information, demand for the Company's services may decrease and the Company's reputation may suffer, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. In addition, such laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with Quad/Graphics internal policies. If so, the Company could suffer costly enforcement actions (including an order requiring changes to Quad/Graphics data practices) and private litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause Quad/Graphics to incur substantial costs or require changes to the Company's business practices in a manner adverse to Quad/Graphics business.\nIf Quad/Graphics is not able to take advantage of technological developments in the printing industry on a timely basis, the Company may experience a decline in the demand for its services, be unable to implement its business strategy and experience reduced profits.\nThe printing industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer clients an array of choices for their marketing and publication needs. In order to grow and remain competitive, the Company will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance the Company's existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of clients. If Quad/Graphics is unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, the Company could lose clients to competitors. In general, the development of new communication channels inside and outside the printing and media solutions industry requires the Company to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of clients. The Company may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market.\nCurrently, there is a limited active market for Quad/Graphics' class A common stock and, as a result, shareholders may be unable to sell their class A common stock without losing a significant portion of their investment.\nThe Company's class A common stock has been traded on the NYSE under the symbol \"QUAD\" since July 6, 2010. However, there is currently a limited active market for the class A common shares. The Company cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the Company will lead to the development of an active trading market for its class A common stock on the NYSE or how liquid that market will become. If a more active trading market does not develop, shareholders may have difficulty selling any class A common stock without negatively affecting the stock price and thereby losing a significant portion of their investment.\nQuad/Graphics' debt facilities include various covenants imposing restrictions that may affect the Company's ability to operate its business.\nOn September 1, 1995, and as last amended on November 24, 2014, Quad/Graphics entered into a Senior Secured Note Agreement (the \"Master Note and Security Agreement\") pursuant to which the Company has issued over time senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion in various tranches. As of December 31, 2014, the borrowings outstanding under the Master Note and Security Agreement were $316.6 million. On April 28, 2014, and as last amended on December 18, 2014, the Company entered into the $1.6 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility, which includes three different loan facilities, a Term Loan A, a Term Loan B, and a revolving credit facility. The $850.0 million revolving credit facility and the $450.0 million Term Loan A mature on April 27, 2019. The $300.0 million Term Loan B matures on April 27, 2021. As of December 31, 2014, the borrowings outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility was $778.5 million. On April 28, 2014, the Company also issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.0% Senior Unsecured Notes, all of which remains outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\nThe Company's various lending arrangements include certain financial covenants. In addition to the financial covenants, the debt facilities also include certain limitations on acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and repurchases of capital stock. As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its debt agreements. While the Company currently expects to be in compliance in future periods with all of the financial covenants, there can be no assurance that these covenants will continue to be met. The Company's failure to maintain compliance with the covenants could prevent the Company from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under any of the debt agreements. Such default could cause the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable, by virtue of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit the Company's business activities, increase its operating costs, reduce demand for its products or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of the Company's businesses is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which the Company operates. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events. Such regulatory environment changes may include changes in environmental laws, requirements of United States and foreign occupational health and safety laws, accounting standards and taxation requirements. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which Quad/Graphics does business and, therefore, may impact its results or increase its costs or liabilities.\nIn addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities, former facilities and contractual obligations of acquired businesses. Permits are required for the operation of certain parts of the Company's business, and these permits are subject to renewal, modification and, in some circumstances, revocation. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs the Company has estimated. Quad/Graphics cannot assure you that the Company's costs in relation to these matters will not exceed its established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nVarious laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels. Proposals under consideration include limitations on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted (so-called \"caps\") together with systems of trading allowed emissions capacities. The impacts of such proposals could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAn other than temporary decline in operating results and enterprise value could lead to non-cash impairment charges due to the impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\nThe Company has a material amount of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet, due in part to acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had the following long-lived assets on its consolidated balance sheet included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022\nGoodwill, representing the excess of the total purchase price for its acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired, of $775.5 million;\n\u2022\nOther intangible assets, primarily representing the fair value of customer relationships acquired, of $149.1 million; and\n\u2022\nProperty, plant and equipment of $1,855.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2014, these assets represented approximately 68% of the Company's total assets. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present based on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit. The Company assesses impairment of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures and other assumptions. A decline in expected profitability, significant negative industry or economic trends, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. As a result, the recoverability of these assets could be called into question and the Company could be required to write down or write off these assets. Such an occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position and could result in the Company being in non-compliance with\ncertain of its debt facility covenants (see \"Quad/Graphics' debt facilities include various covenants imposing restrictions that may affect the Company's ability to operate its business\" above).\nQuad/Graphics may be required to make capital expenditures to maintain its platform and processes and to remain technologically and economically competitive, which may increase its costs or disrupt its operations.\nThe Company may need to make significant capital expenditures as it develops and continues to maintain its platform and processes. The Company also may be required to make capital expenditures to develop and integrate new technologies to remain technologically and economically competitive. In order to accomplish this effectively, the Company will need to deploy its resources efficiently, maintain effective cost controls and bear potentially significant market and raw material risks. If the Company's revenues decline, it may impact the Company's ability to expend the capital necessary to develop and implement new technology and be economically competitive. Debt or equity financing, or cash generated from operations, may not be available or sufficient for these requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt or equity financing is available, it may not be on terms favorable to the Company. In addition, even if capital is available to the Company, there is risk that the Company's vendors will have discontinued the production of parts needed for repairs, replacements or improvements to the Company's existing manufacturing platform, leading the Company to expend more capital than expected to perform such repairs, replacements or improvements.\nQuad/Graphics' revenue is subject to cyclical and seasonal variations.\nThe Company's business is seasonal, with Quad/Graphics recognizing the majority of its operating income in the third and fourth quarters of the financial year, primarily as a result of the increased magazine advertising page counts and retail inserts, catalogs and books from back-to-school and holiday-related advertising and promotions. The fourth quarter is the highest seasonal quarter for cash flows from operating activities and Free Cash Flow due to the reduction of working capital requirements that reach peak levels during the third quarter. Within any year, this seasonality could adversely affect the Company's cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company has significant liabilities with respect to defined benefit pension plans that could grow in the future and cause the Company to incur additional costs.\nAs a result of the 2010 acquisition of World Color Press, the Company assumed frozen single employer defined benefit pension plans for certain of its employees in the United States. The majority of the plans' assets are held in North American and global equity securities and debt securities. The asset allocation as of December 31, 2014, was approximately 66% equity securities and 34% debt securities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had underfunded pension liabilities of approximately $163 million for single employer defined benefit plans in the United States. Under current United States pension law, pension funding deficits are generally required to be funded over a seven-year period. These pension deficits may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan investment performance, pension legislation and other factors. Declines in global, and in particular North American, equity markets would increase the Company's potential pension funding obligations. Any significant increase in the Company's required contributions could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the single employer defined benefit plans described above, the Company participates in multiemployer pension plans (\"MEPPs\") in the United States. Prior to the acquisition of World Color Press by Quad/Graphics, World Color Press received notice that certain plans in which it participated were in critical status, as defined in Section 432 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Internal Revenue Code\"). As a result, the Company could have been subject to increased contribution rates associated with these plans or other MEPPs suffering from declines in their funding levels. Due to the significantly underfunded status of the United States multiemployer plans and the potential increased contribution rates, the Company withdrew from participation in these multiemployer plans and has replaced these pension benefits with a Company-sponsored \"pay as you go\" defined contribution plan, which is historically the form of retirement benefit provided to the Company's employees.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company estimates and has recorded in its financial statements a pre-tax withdrawal liability for all United States multiemployer plans of approximately $59 million in the aggregate. Until discussions with the multiemployer plans' trustees are concluded, the exact amount of the withdrawal liability will not be known, and, as such, a difference from the recorded estimate could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with the Company's operations outside of the United States.\nAlthough the substantial majority of the Company's business activity takes place in the United States, a portion of Quad/Graphics net sales are derived from operations in foreign countries. The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned controlled subsidiaries and other ownership investments in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, Mexico, Peru and Poland. Net sales from the Company's wholly-owned and majority-owned controlled subsidiaries outside of the United States accounted for approximately 9%, 10% and 12% of its consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nAs a result, the Company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States, including, but not limited to: the impact of economic and political instability; fluctuations in currency values, foreign-currency exchange rates, devaluation and conversion restrictions; exchange control regulations and other limits on the Company's ability to import raw materials or finished product; tariffs and other trade barriers; political and economic instability; trade restrictions and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; social unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflicts; inflation and fluctuations in interest rates; language barriers; difficulties in staffing, training, employee retention and managing international operations; logistical and communications challenges; differing local business practices and cultural consideration; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; longer accounts receivable payment cycles; potential adverse tax consequences and being subject to different legal and regulatory regimes that may preclude or make more costly certain initiatives or the implementation of certain elements of its business strategy. Any international expansion or acquisition that the Company undertakes could amplify these risks related to operating outside of the United States.\nQuad/Graphics is exposed to the economic and political conditions in Argentina. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades, characterized by periods of low or negative growth, high and variable levels of inflation and currency devaluation. As a consequence, the Company\u2019s business and operations have been, and could be in the future, affected from time to time to varying degrees by economic and political developments and other material events affecting the Argentine economy. The majority of the Company's employees in Argentina are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A strike, work stoppage or other form of labor protest in Argentina in the future could disrupt the Company's operations and result in a material adverse impact to the Company's Argentina operations' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could force the Company to reassess its strategic alternatives involving operations in Argentina. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $35.6 million of total assets in Argentina, representing 0.9% of Quad/Graphics consolidated total assets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized $71.9 million of net sales in Argentina, representing 1.5% of Quad/Graphics consolidated net sales.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by engaging in business practices that are in violation of United States and foreign anti-corruption regulations such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company operates in parts of the world with developing economies that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There can be no assurance that all of the Company's employees, contractors or agents, including those representing us in countries where practices which violate anti-corruption laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of Quad/Graphics policies and procedures. The failure to comply with the laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties and fines.\nHolders of class A common stock are not able to independently elect directors of Quad/Graphics or control any of the Company's management policies or business decisions or its decisions to issue additional shares, declare and pay dividends or enter into corporate transactions because the holders of class A common stock have substantially less voting power than the holders of the Company's class B common stock, all of which is owned by certain members of the Quadracci family, trusts for their benefit or other affiliates of Quad/Graphics, whose interests may be different from the holders of class A common stock.\nThe Company's outstanding stock is divided into two classes of common stock: class A common stock (\"class A stock\") and class B common stock (\"class B stock\"). The class B stock has ten votes per share on all matters and the class A stock is entitled to one vote per share. As of February 19, 2015, the class B stock constitutes approximately 80% of Quad/Graphics' total voting power. As a result, holders of class B stock are able to exercise a controlling influence over the Company's business, have the power to elect its directors and indirectly control decisions such as whether to issue additional shares, declare and pay dividends or enter into corporate transactions. All of the class B stock is owned by certain members of the Quadracci family or trusts for their benefit, whose interests may differ from the interests of the holders of class A stock.\nApproximately 91% of the outstanding class B stock is held of record by the Quad/Graphics Voting Trust, and that constitutes approximately 73% of the Company's total voting power. The trustees of the Quad/Graphics Voting Trust have the authority to vote the stock held by the Quad/Graphics Voting Trust. Accordingly, the trustees of the Quad/Graphics Voting Trust are able to exercise a controlling influence over the Company's business, have the power to elect its directors and indirectly control decisions such as whether to issue additional shares, declare and pay dividends or enter into corporate transactions.\nQuad/Graphics is a controlled company within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, it relies on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to shareholders of other companies.\nSince the Quad/Graphics Voting Trust owns more than 50% of the total voting power of the Company's stock, the Company is considered a controlled company under the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. As a controlled company, an exception under the NYSE listing standards exempts the Company from the obligation to comply with certain of the NYSE's corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of the Company's board of directors consist of independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE;\n\u2022\nthat the Company have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthat the Company have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities.\nAccordingly, for so long as Quad/Graphics is a controlled company, holders of class A stock will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nThe Company is heavily dependent on its Chief Executive Officer, its management team and key personnel.\nThe Company's continued success depends, in part, on the retention, recruitment and continued contributions of key management, finance, sales and marketing personnel, some of whom could be difficult to replace. The Company's success is largely dependent upon its senior management team, led by its Chief Executive Officer and other key managers. The loss of any one or more of such persons could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to utilize deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, of $319.9 million on the consolidated balance sheet included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to utilize the deferred tax assets to reduce consolidated income tax liabilities over a period of time not to exceed 20 years. However, the Company may not be able to fully utilize the deferred tax assets if its future taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, in the future, the Company may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if the Company believes it is unable to utilize them, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nQuad/Graphics may be adversely affected by interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 55% of the Company's borrowings were subject to variable interest rates. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could adversely affect the Company.\nBecause a portion of the Company's operations are outside of the United States, significant revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the results of operations of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries and business units, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into the Company's consolidated financial statements. To the extent revenues and expenses are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company's efforts at hedging will be successful. There is always a possibility that attempts to hedge currency risks will lead to greater losses than predicted.\nQuad/Graphics may be adversely affected by strikes and other labor protests.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Quad/Graphics had a total of approximately 24,100 employees, of which approximately 2,500 were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had nine collective bargaining agreements in the United States and eight agreements outside of the United States that are either industry-wide individual collective bargaining agreements or works councils or similar arrangements.\nWhile the Company believes its employee relations are good and that the Company maintains an employee-centric culture, and there has not been any material disruption in operations resulting from labor disputes, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to maintain a productive and efficient labor environment. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to the renewal of the collective bargaining agreements, nor can there be any assurance that work stoppages, strikes or other forms of labor protests pending the outcome of any future negotiations will not occur. A strike or other forms of labor protest affecting a series of major plants in the future could materially disrupt the Company's operations and result in a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could force the Company to reassess its strategic alternatives involving certain of its operations.", "PERMNO": 12009, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "QUAD"}
