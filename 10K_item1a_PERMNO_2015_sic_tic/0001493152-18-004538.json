{"cik": "1001601", "company": "MGT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nDiscussion of our business and operations included in this Annual Report should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of our securities. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Annual Report (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future developments.\nThe Company generates limited revenue from operations upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. The Company\u2019s prospects must be considered keeping in mind the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in a constantly changing industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future, if at all.\nThe Company has identified a number of specific risk areas that may affect our operations and results in the future:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have had limited commercial results and revenues, and we may be required to curtail operations if adequate funds are not available to us.\nOur commercial results have been limited. Historically, the Company has not generated significant revenues to fund its operations, and the Company cannot be certain that revenues will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s primary source of operating funds since inception has been debt and equity financings. The Company has also earned a limited amount of revenue through its bitcoin operations. At December 31, 2017, MGT\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $9,519. As of March 31, 2018, MGT\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $460.\nThe Company may raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings, in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance, moreover, that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. The Company may also attempt to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that the Company would not otherwise relinquish. There can be no assurance that any such plan will be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and do not include adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had incurred significant operating losses since inception, and continues to generate losses from operations, and has an accumulated deficit of $378,900. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements incorporated in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe further development and acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of transactions in bitcoins and other digital currencies, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of bitcoin may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe use of digital currencies such as bitcoins to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services, and the acquisition of digital currencies as an investment, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Bitcoin is a prominent, but not a unique part of this industry. The growth of this industry in general, and bitcoin in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of this industry, include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital currencies;\n\u25cf government and quasi-government regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the bitcoin network or similar digital asset systems;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the bitcoin network;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and\n\u25cf negative consumer perception of bitcoins specifically and cryptocurrencies generally.\nA decline in the popularity or acceptance of bitcoin may adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrently, there is relatively small use of bitcoins in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively large use by speculators, thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBitcoins have only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by certain major retail and commercial outlets, and use of bitcoins by consumers to pay such retail and commercial outlets remains limited. Conversely, a significant portion of bitcoin demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of bitcoins. Many industry commentators believe that bitcoin\u2019s best use case is as a store of wealth, rather than as a currency for transactions, and that other cryptocurrencies having better scalability and faster settlement times will better serve as currency. This could limit bitcoin\u2019s acceptance as transactional currency. A lack of expansion by bitcoins into retail and commercial markets, or a contraction of such use, may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the Bitcoin Index Price, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSecurity threats could result in the halting of our operations and a loss of assets or damage to our reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the Blockchain industry. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm our business operations or result in loss of our assets. Any breach of our infrastructure could result in damage to our reputation.\nAny bitcoins we mine may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of the bitcoins we mine could be lost, stolen or destroyed. Although we will seek to use various technology to minimize the risk of loss, damage and theft, we cannot guarantee the prevention of such loss, damage or theft, whether caused intentionally, accidentally or by an act of God. Access to our bitcoins could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake or flood) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these events may adversely affect our operations. In addition, government regulations in the United States and abroad could materially alter the landscape for bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies use and accessibility, including through tax regulations, restrictions on use in transactions and regulation or prohibition of cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological changes, our solutions may become less competitive and our business may suffer.\nThe market for bitcoin technology is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. We may need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our solutions to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could adversely affect our business.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic health of our prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions remain unstable, and these conditions may make it difficult for our prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our solutions, reduced bookings and lower or no growth.\nOur ability to attract, train and retain qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and any future growth.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services, and professional services personnel with appropriate financial reporting experience. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have breached their legal obligations or that we have induced such breaches, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the Company or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies, with certain governments deeming them illegal while others have allowed their use and trade. On-going and future regulatory actions may impact the ability of the Company to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company.\nThe effect of any future regulatory change on the Company or any cryptocurrency that the Company may mine or hold for others is impossible to predict, and such change could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company.\nGovernments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition, use or redemption of cryptocurrencies. Ownership of, holding or trading in cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject cryptocurrency companies to additional regulation.\nOn July 25, 2017, the SEC released an investigative report which states that the United States would, in some circumstances, consider the offer and sale of Blockchain tokens pursuant to an initial coin offering (\u201cICO\u201d) subject to federal securities laws. Thereafter, China released statements and took similar actions. Although the Company does not participate in ICOs, its clients and customers may participate in ICOs and these actions may be a prelude to further action which chills widespread acceptance of Blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company.\nGovernments may in the future take regulatory actions that prohibit or severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, use or trade cryptocurrencies or to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency. Similar actions by governments or regulatory bodies (such as an exchange on which the Company\u2019s securities are listed, quoted or traded) could result in restrictions of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading in the Company\u2019s securities. Such a restriction could result in the Company liquidating its inventory at unfavorable prices and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s shareholders and have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, raise new capital or maintain a securities listing with an exchange which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and harm investors in the Company\u2019s securities.\nTerrorist actions and attacks may have a negative impact on economic conditions and market liquidity.\nThere is a risk of terrorist attacks on the United States and elsewhere causing significant loss of life and property damage and disruptions in the global market. Economic and diplomatic sanctions may be in place or imposed on certain states and military action may be commenced. The impact of such events is unclear, but could have a material effect on general economic conditions and market liquidity.\nOperations outside the United States may be subject to additional risks.\nOur principal plants include facilities in Sweden, as well as the United States. The operations outside the United States could be disrupted by a natural disaster, severe weather, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, public health concerns, or other unforeseen events that would be less likely to occur in the United States. Disruption of an overseas operation or significant supplier could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReliance on third parties to operate our mining machines may cause delays in production and mining and could have an impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe Company relies on third parties to operate its bitcoin mining machinery. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to operate our mining machinery, we remain responsible for the overall mining operations. Many of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If the third parties operating our machinery do not perform their contractual duties or obligations we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be costly, and mining operations may be delayed or terminated. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third party contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract machinery operators, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider, such as Slush Pool or Antpool, for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on the Company operations.\nWe use a third-party mining pool to receive our mining rewards from the network. Bitcoin mining pools allow miners to combine their computing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our contribution to the pool\u2019s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator\u2019s system suffer downtime due to a cyber attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related services or that accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in the Company\u2019s securities.\nA number of companies that provide bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies and could decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the future. Similarly, the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of cryptocurrencies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses providing bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related services. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and commodities exchanges, the over the counter market and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations, could result in the inability of our investors to open or maintain stock or commodities accounts, including the ability to deposit, maintain or trade the Company\u2019s securities. Such factors would have a material adverse effect the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and harm investors.\nTo the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately sell bitcoins earned by mining in the market, resulting in a reduction in the price of bitcoins that could adversely impact the Company and similar actions could affect other cryptocurrencies.\nOver the past two years, bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated \u201cprofessionalized\u201d mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell bitcoins earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoins for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoins greatly increases the supply of bitcoins, creating downward pressure on the price of bitcoins.\nThe extent to which the value of bitcoin mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoin rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin-and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially reducing bitcoin prices. Lower bitcoin prices could result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for professionalized mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of bitcoin until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoin could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin that could adversely impact the Company.\nThe foregoing risks associated with bitcoin could be equally applicable to other cryptocurrencies, existing now or introduced in the future. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account.\nPolitical or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of bitcoins and ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, which could result in a reduction in value and adversely affect the Company.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, digital assets such as bitcoins and ethereum, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of bitcoins and ethereum and other cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of bitcoins and ethereum or other cryptocurrencies would result in a reduction in their value and could adversely affect the Company. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account.\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoins, ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, participate in the Blockchain or utilize similar digital assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect the Company.\nAlthough currently bitcoins, ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain and digital assets generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries such as China and Russia may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these digital assets or to exchange for fiat currency. Such restrictions may adversely affect the Company. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and harm investors.\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of bitcoins or other digital assets under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, the Company may be required to register and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that the Company decides to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to the Company. The Company may also decide to cease certain operations. Any disruption of the Company\u2019s operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to the Company.\nCurrent and future legislation and SEC rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins or other cryptocurrency is viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoins and other cryptocurrency may not be excluded from the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d by SEC rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions, unless another exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency amongst owners and require registration of trading platforms as \u201cexchanges\u201d such as Coinsquare. The Company cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies under the law. If the Company fails to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Company may seek to cease certain of its operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and harm investors.\nThere have been calls for bitcoin and other cryptocurrency regulation in China, which might make bitcoin mining uneconomical for us.\nThe Peoples Bank of China has recently instituted restrictions on certain exchange trading in cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Further governmental regulation could negatively impact pricing for bitcoin. In addition, the Company\u2019s sole source of mining computers is a Chinese company, exposing the Company to risk if restrictions are placed on the export of such computers.\nDemand for bitcoins is driven, in part, by its status as the most prominent and secure digital asset. It is possible that a digital asset other than bitcoins could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins.\nBitcoins hold a \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d advantage over other digital currencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Having a large mining network results in greater user confidence regarding the security and long-term stability of a digital asset\u2019s network and its Blockchain; as a result, the advantage of more users and miners makes a digital asset more secure, which makes it more attractive to new users and miners, resulting in a network effect that strengthens the first-to-market advantage. Nonetheless, it is possible that another form of digital currency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market share, this could reduce the profitability of our bitcoin operations.\nBecause the number of bitcoins awarded for solving a block in the bitcoin network Blockchain continually decreases, miners must invest in increasing processing power to maintain their yield of bitcoins, which might make bitcoin mining uneconomical for the Company.\nThe award of new bitcoins for solving blocks continually declines, so that bitcoin miners must invest in increasing processing power in order to maintain or increase their yield of bitcoins. The Company is committed to increasing its investment in its bitcoin mining operations, but if the pricing of bitcoins were to decline significantly, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to recover its investment in the computer hardware and processing power required to upgrade its mining operations. There can, moreover, be no assurance that the Company will have the resources to upgrade its processing power in order to maintain the continuing profitability of its bitcoin mining operations. Also, the developers of the bitcoin network or other programmers could propose amendments to the network\u2019s protocols and software that, if accepted, might require the Company to modify its bitcoin operations, and increase its investment in bitcoin, in order to maintain profitability. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to do so.\nThe Company continues to have discussions with potential investors to purchase more bitcoin mining machines, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing.\nThe Company is considering further increasing the processing power of its bitcoin mining operations, as the Company seeks to leverage its experience and expertise in this area of operations. To do so, however, the Company will need to raise additional investment capital. While we are in discussions with potential investors to provide the necessary capital to purchase additional bitcoin mining machines, we cannot assure you that these discussions will lead to our obtaining additional capital or that we will otherwise be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to expand our bitcoin operations. If we are successful in raising capital to expand our bitcoin operations, the form in which the capital is invested could be different from the way we have traditionally structured capital investments in the Company. For example, funds could be invested through a joint venture or similar arrangement, in which the Company does not have the entire equity ownership interest.\nA number of claims have been filed against the Company alleging violations of federal securities laws.\nA number of law firms have filed claims, or announced an intention to file, on behalf of stockholders of the Company, alleging that the company has violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While the Company believes that there are no merits to claims that the Company violated applicable securities laws, the results of any investigation, or the outcome of any claims that may brought against us, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, regardless of the outcome, investigations can have an adverse impact on us because they may entail a significant amount of costs to defend the Company against any claims, such claims may negatively affect morale of employees and may divert the attention of management.\nAn alleged derivative action has been filed against the Company\u2019s officers and directors alleging mismanagement.\nIn January 2017, the Company was served with a summons and complaint as a nominal defendant in a New York State court derivative action alleging that certain officers and directors of the Company inadequately managed the business and assets of the Company resulting in the deterioration of the Company\u2019s financial condition. In February 2017, the parties stipulated to a stay of the action pending resolution of the securities actions against the Company described above. The Company and the named defendants believe that the derivative action is without merit. Nevertheless, were the derivative action to proceed, the action, which the Company is required to defend, could be costly and could prove a distraction to the efforts of management to promote the Company\u2019s business plan.\nThe Company has received a subpoena from the SEC.\nOn September 15, 2016, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting certain information from the Company, and in December 2017 our President and Chief Executive Officer also received a subpoena from the SEC. We have no indication or reason to believe that the Company or its officers or directors are or will be the subject of any enforcement proceedings. The Company has publicly announced its receipt of the subpoena and is fully cooperating to comply with the SEC\u2019s request. Nevertheless, response to the subpoena has entailed, and may continue to entail legal costs and the diversion of management\u2019s attention, and the issuance of the subpoena may create a perception of wrongdoing that could be harmful to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe Company is subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nTrading in our Common Stock is also subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur stock price and trading volume may be volatile, which could result in losses for our stockholders.\nThe equity markets may experience periods of volatility, which could result in highly variable and unpredictable pricing of equity securities. The market price of our Common Stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business, our industry or our operating performance and financial condition and could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Common Stock. We cannot predict the potential impact of these periods of volatility on the price of our Common Stock. The Company cannot assure you that the market price of our Common Stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and volume to decline.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, including upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or registration for resale, or the conversion of preferred stock or exercise of warrants, circumstances commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d could result, in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s shares could be subject to wide price swings since the value of cryptocurrencies may be subject to pricing risk and have historically been subject to wide swings in value.\nThe Company\u2019s shares are subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that influence stock prices or the value of non-cryptocurrency assets such as revenue, cashflows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the value and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or the Blockchain generally, factors over which the Company has little or no influence or control. The Company\u2019s share prices may also be subject to pricing volatility due to supply and demand factors associated with few or limited public company options for investment in the segment.\nCryptocurrency market prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets, and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, or the Company or its share price, inflating and making their market prices more volatile or creating \u201cbubble\u201d type risks.\nIn addition, the success of the Company, the Company\u2019s share price, and the interest in investors and the public in the Company as an early entrant into the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem may in large part be the result of the Company\u2019s early emergence as a publicly traded company in which holders of appreciated cryptocurrency have an opportunity to invest inflated cryptocurrency profits for shares of the Company, which could be perceived as a way to maintaining investing exposure to the Blockchain and cryptocurrency markets without exposing the investor to the risk in a particular cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency holders have realized exponential value due to large increases in the prices of cryptocurrencies and may seek to lock in cryptocurrency appreciation, which investing in the Company\u2019s securities may be perceived as a way to achieve that result, but may not continue in the future. As a result, the value of the Company\u2019s securities, and the value of cryptocurrencies generally may be more likely to fluctuate due to changing investor confidence in future appreciation (or depreciation) in market prices, profits from related or unrelated investments or holdings of cryptocurrency. Such factors or events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, or on the price of the Company\u2019s securities, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account.\nInvestor relations activities, nominal \u201cfloat\u201d and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our stock.\nThe Company may utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for the Company. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. The Company may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning the Company. The Company does not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. In addition, investors in the Company may, from time to time, also take steps to encourage investor awareness through similar activities that may be undertaken at their own expense. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued, which may impact the trading market for our Common Stock. Any of these activities could affect our stock price in a manner that is unrelated to the underlying value of our Company.\nThe ability of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the board of directors to issue such additional shares of preferred stock, with such rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the board of directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent officers and directors from office even if such removal would be favorable to stockholders generally.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends.", "PERMNO": 91050, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "MGTI"}
