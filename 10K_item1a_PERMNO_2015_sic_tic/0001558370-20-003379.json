{"cik": "75288", "company": "OXFORD INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below highlight some of the factors that could materially affect our operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, prospects and/or operating results may be adversely affected. These are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we currently consider immaterial or are not presently known to us may also adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nActual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or other public health crises may adversely affect our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail stores and restaurants, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in our receipt or delivery of inventory.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this pandemic, the governments and public health officials of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions to mitigate the spread and severity of the coronavirus, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we saw reduced consumer traffic starting in early March 2020 and temporarily closed all our retail and restaurants in North America on March 17, 2020. Subsequent to those closures, we also temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Australia. This pandemic and the related preventative and protective actions have significantly impacted our business and the business operations of other apparel retailers, including our wholesale customers, and has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our sales and results of operations for Fiscal 2020.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending, and we cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over, which our business will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic. There are numerous uncertainties associated with this outbreak, including the number of individuals who will become infected, whether a vaccine or cure that mitigates the effect of the virus will be synthesized, and, if so, when such vaccine or cure will be ready to be used, the extent of the protective and preventative measures that have been put in place by both governmental entities and other businesses and those that may be put in place in the future, whether the coronavirus\u2019 impact will be seasonal, the duration of store and restaurant closures, the impact on the U.S. and world economy and numerous other uncertainties. Further, even after containment of the virus or after some or all of our stores and restaurants are able to resume operations, any significant reduction in consumer willingness to visit malls and shopping\ncenters, the levels of consumer discretionary spending or employee willingness to work in our stores and restaurants would result in a further loss of revenues of cash flows.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, our office locations and distribution centers, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, staggered shifts and other social distancing efforts, labor shortages and decreased productivity. These effects may negatively impact our ability to meet consumer demand and may increase our costs of production and distribution.\nFor the reasons set forth above and other reasons that may come to light if this coronavirus outbreak and any associated protective or preventative measures expand, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to our business, revenues, financial condition or results of operations; however, the adverse impact of this event will be significant.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry which is evolving very rapidly; our ability to execute our direct to consumer and portfolio-level strategies and/or transform our operations in light of shifts in consumer shopping behavior subjects us to risks that could adversely affect our financial results and operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which the principal competitive factors are the reputation, value and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; product fulfillment capabilities; and customer service. We believe that our ability to compete successfully is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, including the manner in which retail consumers seek to transact business and access products, and presenting appealing products for consumers when and where they seek it.\nThe highly competitive apparel industry is characterized by highly reduced barriers to entry. There is an abundant number of domestic and foreign apparel designers, manufacturers, distributors, importers, licensors and retailers, some of whom are also our customers, and some of whom may be significantly larger, are more diversified and/or have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales, increased costs, lower prices for our products and/or decreased margins.\nOne of our key initiatives has been to grow our branded businesses through distribution strategies that allow our consumers to access our brands whenever and wherever they choose to shop. Our success depends to a large degree on our ability to design and deliver compelling products; introduce new retail, restaurant and other concepts; identify suitable locations with the proper consumer demographics and suitable economic structures; establish the infrastructure necessary to support growth; source appropriate levels of inventory; hire and train qualified personnel; anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing technology to align with our consumers\u2019 shopping preferences; maintain brand specific websites, mobile applications and other social media presence that offer the functionality and security customers expect; and enhance our advertising and marketing activities effectively to maintain our current customers and attract and introduce new ones to our brands and offerings.\nThe retail apparel market has been evolving very rapidly and in ways that are having a disruptive impact on traditional fashion retailers. This includes greater transparency for consumers in product pricing and competitive offerings from competing brands as a result of technological advances; continued declines in retail traffic for traditional fashion retailers, as consumers find new ways to shop; the entry by large e-commerce retailers and others with significant financial resources and enhanced distribution capabilities into the fashion retail space; increased investment in technology and multi-channel distribution strategies by large, traditional bricks and mortar and big box retailers; ongoing success in off-price and fast fashion channels of distribution, in particular those who offer brand label products at clearance; an increased emphasis by consumers on purchasing products that incorporate sustainable materials and practices in the supply chain; and increased promotional activities, both online and in-store, by department stores and traditional fashion retailers seeking to remain competitive, and in some cases viable.\nAny inability on our part to properly manage the competitive challenges in our industry and effectively adapt to the evolving consumer shopping behavioral trends may result in lost sales, increase our costs and/or adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, reputation and credibility.\nOur success depends on the reputation and value of our brands; any failure to maintain the reputation or value of our brands and/or to offer innovative, fashionable and desirable products could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names. The value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us or by our wholesale customers or others who have an interest in the brands. Actions that could cause harm to our brands include failing to respond to emerging fashion trends or meet consumer quality expectations; selling products bearing our brands through distribution channels that are inconsistent with the retail channels in which our customers expect to find those brands; becoming overly promotional; or setting up consumer expectations for promotional activity for our products. Customer activation, retention and acquisition in today\u2019s technology-driven retail environment is critical and becoming more costly. As a result, we are becoming more reliant on social media as one of our marketing strategies, and the value of our brands could be adversely affected if we do not effectively communicate our brand message through social media vehicles that interface with existing and potential customers in \u201creal-time.\u201d\nDuring Fiscal 2019, Tommy Bahama\u2019s and Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s net sales represented 60% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. The significant concentration in our portfolio heightens the risks we face if one of these brands fails to meet our expectations and/or is adversely impacted by actions we or third parties take with respect to that brand or by competitive conditions in the apparel industry.\nAlthough certain of our products carry over from season to season, the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry, there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumer preferences and changes in consumer demographics. Any failure on our part to develop and market appealing products could harm the reputation and desirability of our brands and products and/or result in weakened financial performance.\nWe also license many of our brand names to third party licensees, including for purposes of developing and marketing products outside of our core categories; for purposes of retail and/or wholesale distribution of our products, including our Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores and Southern Tide Signature Stores; and to introduce new concepts outside our core expertise. While we enter into comprehensive license and similar collaborative agreements with these third parties covering product design, product quality, brand standards, sourcing, social compliance, distribution, operations, manufacturing and/or marketing requirements and approvals, there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products or concepts outside of our core apparel products, by the market perception of the third parties with whom we associate and/or due to the actions of a licensee. The improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands.\nIn addition, we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers, licensees or other third parties, and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing and distribution efforts and practices or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations.\nWe have a robust legal and social compliance program for our third party manufacturers and vendors, including codes of conduct and vendor compliance standards. The reputation of our brands could be harmed if these third parties, substantially all of which are located outside the United States, fail to meet appropriate product safety, product quality and social compliance (including labor practices and human rights) standards. Despite our efforts, we cannot ensure that our manufacturers and vendors will at all times conduct their operations in accordance with ethical practices or that the products we purchase will always meet our safety and quality control standards. Any violation of our applicable codes of conduct, social compliance programs or local laws by our manufacturers or vendors or other actions or failures by us or such parties may result in a negative public perception of our brands or products, as well as disrupt our supply chain, which may adversely affect our business operations.\nOur business and financial condition are heavily influenced by general economic conditions, which are outside of our control.\nWe are a consumer products company and are highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending and retail traffic patterns. The demand for apparel products changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change and may be significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending patterns, which may be influenced by employment levels; recessions; inflation; fuel and energy costs; interest rates; tax rates; personal debt levels; savings rates; stock market and housing market volatility; shifting social ideology; natural disasters, public health issues (such as the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and/or weather patterns; and general uncertainty about the future. The factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending patterns are outside of our control and difficult to predict, and, often, the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. In addition, as the growth in our direct to consumer operations continues to outpace our other operations, we have increased exposure to the risks associated with a volatile and unpredictable economic environment. Any decline in consumer confidence or change in discretionary consumer spending patterns could reduce our sales and/or adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAdditionally, significant changes in the operations or liquidity of any of the parties with which we conduct our business, including suppliers, customers, trademark licensees and lenders, among others, now or in the future, or in the access to capital markets for any such parties, could result in lower demand for our products, lower sales, higher costs, greater credit risk on our sales or other disruptions in our business.\nThe loss of one or more of our key wholesale customers, or a significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial performance or financial position, could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few key customers. For example, during Fiscal 2019, 44% of our consolidated wholesale sales, or 13% of our consolidated net sales, were to our five largest customers. Over the last several years, there have been significant levels of store closures and bankruptcies and financial restructurings by department stores and other large retailers, particularly as the retail industry has transitioned more towards online and mobile transactions; increased prevalence and emphasis on private label products at large retailers; direct sourcing of products by large retailers; consolidation of a number of retailers; and increased competition experienced by our wholesale customers from online competitors. A decrease in the number of stores that carry our products, restructuring of our customers\u2019 operations, continued store closures by major department stores and other large retailers, increased direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers, realignment of customer affiliations or other factors could negatively impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our wholesale customers. Instead, we rely on long-standing relationships with these customers, the appeal of our brands and our position within the marketplace. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and each relationship can typically be terminated by either party at any time. A decision by one or more of our key wholesale customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us, whether motivated by competitive considerations, quality or style issues, financial difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, could adversely affect our net sales and profitability, as it would be difficult to immediately, if at all, replace this business with new customers, reduce our operating costs or increase sales volumes with other existing customers. In addition, as department stores and other retailers become more promotional, we continuously evaluate our sales to certain wholesale channels of distribution, for brand protection or otherwise, and in some cases have terminated or curtailed our sales to those customers and may continue to do so, which impacts our net sales and profitability.\nWe also extend credit to most of our key wholesale customers without requiring collateral, which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers. At February 1, 2020, our five largest outstanding customer balances represented $32 million, or 55% of our consolidated receivables balance. Companies in the apparel industry, including some of our customers, may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and\nreorganizations, tightened credit markets and/or declining sales and profitability, all of which may be exacerbated as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and any resulting economic downturn. A significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial position or ability to satisfy its obligations to us could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, in some cases after we have already made product purchase commitments for inventory; require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables; or limit our ability to collect amounts related to shipments to that customer.\nWe rely to a large extent on third party producers in foreign countries to meet our production demands, and failures by these producers to meet our requirements, the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices and/or changes in international trade regulation may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, disrupt our supply chain or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.\nWe source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries, including sourcing approximately 49% and 18% of our product purchases from China and Vietnam, respectively, during Fiscal 2019. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers, generally we do not have long-term supply contracts but, instead, conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We also depend on the ability of these third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity, and in some cases, the products we purchase and the raw materials that are used in our products are available only from one source or a limited number of sources. Although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of available production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. In addition, we may experience disruptions in our supply chain as we actively seek to diversify the jurisdictions from which we source products. Any such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis. This would jeopardize our ability to properly merchandise our direct to consumer channels and service our customers, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales and profits.\nDue to our sourcing activities, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate. These risks include changes in social, political, labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located; the imposition of additional or new duties, tariffs, taxes, quota restrictions or other changes and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such changes, including lingering uncertainties with respect to the potential imposition or retraction of punitive tariffs on products manufactured in China; public health issues, such as the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, leading government-imposed restrictions; significant delays in the delivery of our products, due to security or other considerations; fluctuations in sourcing costs; the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties; fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; changes in customs procedures for importing apparel products; and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries. We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. Any of these factors may disrupt our supply chain, and we may be unable to offset any associated cost increases by shifting production to suitable manufacturers in other jurisdictions in a timely manner or at acceptable prices, and future regulatory actions or changes in international trade regulation may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or render our products less desirable in the marketplace.\nOur operations are reliant on information technology and any interruption or other failure, including an inability to timely upgrade our systems, may impair our ability to provide products to our customers, efficiently conduct our operations and/or meet the needs of our management.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on information technology. This requires us to devote significant financial and employee resources to information technology initiatives and operations. Information systems\nare used in all stages of our operations and as a method of communication with our customers, service providers and suppliers. Many of our information technology solutions are operated and/or maintained by third parties, including our use of cloud-based solutions. Additionally, each of our operating groups uses e-commerce websites, point-of-sale systems and wholesale ordering systems to acquire, manage and sell goods. Our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources, manage operations and forecast and report our operating results. Service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors, including power outages, consumer traffic levels, computer viruses, hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties, human error, disasters or failures to properly install, upgrade, integrate, protect, repair or maintain our various systems and e-commerce websites. We regularly evaluate upgrades or enhancements to our information systems to more efficiently and competitively operate our businesses, including periodic upgrades to warehouse management, guest relations, omnichannel and/or enterprise order management systems in our businesses. We may experience difficulties during the implementation, upgrade or subsequent operation of our systems and/or not be equipped to address system problems. Any material disruption in our information technology solutions, or any failure to timely, efficiently and effectively integrate new systems, could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, as our business continues to grow and we face new challenges in the current retail environment, we evaluate our systems on an ongoing basis to ensure they meet our business needs and, as needed, replace and/or upgrade those systems, which may be expensive undertakings. We must, however, be diligent in our evaluation of these systems, as reliance on outdated technology may inhibit our ability to operate efficiently, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As we transition to new systems, we may also face certain challenges, including the risk of introducing cybersecurity vulnerabilities into our systems or the loss of certain functionality, information from our legacy systems and efficient interfaces with third party and continuing systems. Temporary processes or solutions, including manual operations, which may be required to be instituted in the short term could also significantly increase the risk of loss or corruption of data and information. All of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our primary distribution facilities in order to support our direct to consumer and wholesale operations, meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies, and any disruption or failure in these facilities may materially adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe may have a greater risk than our peers due to the concentration of our distribution facilities, as substantially all of our products for each operating group are distributed through one or two principal distribution centers. The primary distribution facilities that we operate are: a distribution center in Auburn, Washington dedicated to our Tommy Bahama products; a distribution center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania dedicated to our Lilly Pulitzer products; a distribution center in Toccoa, Georgia dedicated to our Lanier Apparel products; and a distribution center in Lyons, Georgia primarily dedicated to our Lilly Pulitzer, Lanier Apparel and Southern Tide products. Each of these distribution centers relies on computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks. Our ability to support our direct to consumer operations, meet customer expectations, manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities, each of which manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of finished goods.\nIf any of our primary distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, pandemics or epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), human error, cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or otherwise, if our distribution facilities fail to upgrade their technological systems to ensure efficient operations or if we are unable to receive goods in a distribution center or to ship the goods in a distribution center, as a result of a technology failure or otherwise, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, a reduction in sales, higher costs, insufficient inventory at our retail stores to meet consumer expectations and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products. In addition, for the distribution facilities that we operate, there are substantial fixed costs associated with these large, highly automated distribution centers, and we could experience reduced operating and cost efficiencies during periods of economic weakness. Any disruption to our distribution facilities or in their efficient operation could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships.\nCybersecurity attacks and/or breaches of information security or privacy could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur additional expenses, expose us to litigation and/or cause us financial harm.\nCybersecurity attacks continue to become increasingly sophisticated, and experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our assets, including confidential information, or disrupt our systems. We are regularly subject to attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to our networks, systems and data, or to obtain, change or destroy confidential information. In addition, customers may use devices or software that are beyond our control environment to purchase our products, which may provide additional avenues for attackers to gain access to confidential information.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, if an actual or perceived data security breach occurs, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, vandalism, ransomware, human error or otherwise, or if there are perceived vulnerabilities in our systems, the image of our brands and our reputation and credibility could be damaged, and, in some cases, our continued operations may be impaired or restricted. The costs to prevent, eliminate or mitigate cyber or other security problems and vulnerabilities, including to comply with security or other measures under state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, to resolve any litigation or to investigate any actual or perceived breach and to enhance cybersecurity protection through organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants could be significant and result in significant financial losses and expenses, as well as lost sales. In addition, although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our operations may be adversely affected by an actual or perceived data security breach. While we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance in an escalating threat environment that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts, and any insurance we maintain may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses.\nAs an ongoing part of our business operations, including direct to consumer transactions and marketing through various social media tools, we regularly collect and use sensitive and confidential personal information, including of our customers, employees and suppliers. The routine operation of our business involves the storage and transmission of customer personal information and preferences, and we use social media and other online and technology-driven marketing and related activities to connect with our customers. The regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is complex, and the security of personal information is a matter of public concern.\nAs part of our routine operations, we also contract with third party service providers to store, process and transmit personal information of our customers and employees. Although we contractually require that these providers implement reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur at their location or within their systems. Privacy breaches of confidential information stored or used by our third party service providers or disruptions in their systems may expose us to the same risks as a breach of our own systems, including negative publicity, potential out-of-pocket costs and adverse effects on our business and customer relationships.\nThe regulatory environment is constantly changing with new and modified state, federal and international privacy and security laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the E.U. and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective in Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Compliance with these laws, and any newly enacted laws and regulations, may require us to modify our operations and/or incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to significant fines and penalties or adverse publicity.\nIn addition, because we process and transmit payment card information, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard and card brand operating rules, which provides for a comprehensive set of rules relating to the retention and/or transmission of payment card information. If we do not comply with the applicable standards, we\nmay be subject to fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur business depends on our senior management and other key personnel, and the unsuccessful transition of key management responsibilities, the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business, our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations, business relationships and ability to execute our strategies.\nOur senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries, with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Thomas C. Chubb III having worked with our company for over 30 years, including in various executive management capacities. Our success depends on disciplined execution at all levels of our organization, including our senior management, and continued succession planning. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies that may have greater financial resources than us. While we believe that we have depth within our management team, the unexpected loss of any of our senior management, or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership, could harm our business and financial performance. In addition, we may be unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel in key areas such as product design, sales, marketing (including individuals with key insights into digital and social media marketing strategies), distribution, technology, sourcing and other support functions, which could result in missed sales opportunities and harm to key business relationships.\nWe may be unable to grow our business through organic growth, and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOne key component of our business strategy is organic growth in our brands. Organic growth may be achieved by, among other things, increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels; selling our products in new markets, such as the opening of Lilly Pulitzer retail stores in Hawaii in Fiscal 2018 and California in Fiscal 2019; increasing our market share in existing markets; expanding the demographic appeal of our brands; expanding our margins through product cost reductions, price increases, or otherwise; expanding the customer reach of our brands through new and enhanced advertising initiatives; and increasing the product offerings and concepts within our various operating groups, such as the opening of additional Marlin Bars at Tommy Bahama and the launch of owned retail stores at Southern Tide. Successful growth of our business is subject to, among other things, our ability to implement plans for expanding and/or maintaining our existing businesses and categories within our businesses at satisfactory levels. We may not be successful in achieving suitable organic growth, and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have engaged in a multi-year initiative to improve Tommy Bahama\u2019s operating performance and long-term growth prospects, which has included an enhanced outlet and clearance strategy, improving gross margin through selective price increases and reducing product costs, selectively right-sizing our store footprint and controlling overhead and operating expenses. A strategic initiative of this nature is inherently challenging and faces significant potential risks, and any failure may adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term sustainable growth while at the same time detracting from our focus and execution of other strategic initiatives.\nIn addition, investments we make in technology, advertising and infrastructure, retail stores and restaurants, office and distribution center facilities, personnel and elsewhere may not yield the full benefits we anticipate and/or sales growth may be outpaced by increases in operating costs, putting downward pressure on our operating margins and adversely affecting our results of operations. If we are unable to increase our revenues organically, we may be required to pursue other strategic initiatives, including reductions in costs and/or acquisitions, in order to grow our business. These initiatives may not be available to us on desirable terms, inhibiting our ability to increase profitability.\nThe acquisition of new businesses and the divestiture or discontinuation of businesses and product lines have certain inherent risks, including, for example, strains on our management team and unexpected costs and other charges resulting from the transaction.\nGrowth of our business through acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model is a component of our long-term business strategy. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: the competitive climate for desirable acquisition candidates, which drives market multiples; the benefits of the acquisition not materializing as planned or not materializing within the time periods or to the extent anticipated; our ability to manage the people and processes of an acquired business; difficulties in retaining key relationships with customers and suppliers; risks in entering geographic markets and/or product categories in which we have no or limited prior experience; the assumption of contractual and other liabilities, some of which may not be known at the time of acquisition; and the possibility that we pay more to consummate an acquisition than the value we derive from the acquired business. Additionally, acquisitions may cause us to incur debt, or make dilutive issuances of our equity securities.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence. Although we may be entitled to indemnification against undisclosed liabilities from the sellers of the acquired business, our recourse may be limited and we cannot be certain that the indemnification, even if obtained, will be enforceable or collectible. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, distract our management or harm our reputation.\nCertain acquisitions may also be structured utilizing contingent consideration based on the acquired business\u2019 post-closing results. The principals from whom we acquired such a business, many of whom may continue to operate the business as our employees, may have differing interests than those of our shareholders because of such arrangements.\nIn addition, integrating acquired businesses is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. The integration process for newly acquired businesses could create a number of challenges and adverse consequences for us associated with the integration of product lines, support functions, employees, sales teams and outsourced manufacturers; employee turnover, including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses; disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines; maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; operating business in new geographic territories; diversion of the attention of our management from other areas of our business; and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and we cannot be certain that any acquisition will be successful and will not materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs described in Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report, at the time of an acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, such as trademarks, reacquired rights and customer relationships, and record goodwill generally to the extent the cost to acquire a business exceeds our assessment of the net fair value of tangible and intangible assets. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist at that date. It is possible that we could have an impairment charge for intangible assets or goodwill associated with an acquired business in future periods if, among other things, economic conditions decline, our strategies for an acquired business change, the results of operations of an acquired business are less than anticipated at the time of acquisition or enterprise values and market multiples of comparable businesses decline. A future impairment charge for intangible assets or goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nAs the fashion retail environment evolves, our investment criteria for acquisitions has grown to include smaller brands, such as Southern Tide and TBBC which we acquired in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, respectively, in an earlier stage of the brand\u2019s life cycle, where we can more fully integrate the brand into our existing infrastructure and shared services functions and better leverage our resources. While acquisitions of these early stage brands may have a smaller upfront purchase price, the limited operating history, less experienced management teams and less sophisticated systems,\ninfrastructure and relationships generally associated with such brands may heighten the risks associated with acquisitions generally, including the heightened risk that the target company may be unable to achieve the projected financial results anticipated. In addition, we are frequently engaged by burgeoning brands seeking debt or equity financing, as well as strategic direction, about pursuing a non-controlling investment, which we did with TBBC prior to the acquisition. Minority investments, while not requiring the same level of financial commitment as a control transaction, presents additional risks, including the potential disproportionate distraction to our management team relative to the potential financial benefit; the potential for a conflict of interest; the damage to our reputation of associating with a brand which may take actions inconsistent with our values; and the financial risks associated with making an investment in an unproven business model.\nFrom time to time, we also divest or discontinue businesses, product lines and/or programs, including exiting relationships with certain wholesale customers, including department stores, that do not align with our strategy or provide the returns that we expect or desire. Such dispositions and/or discontinuations may result in underutilization of our retained resources if the exited operations are not replaced with new lines of business, either internally or through acquisition. In addition, we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities, some of which may be triggered or increased by a purchaser\u2019s operation of the disposed business following the transaction. Those liabilities combined with any other liabilities we contractually retain, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various federal, foreign, state and local laws and regulations, and the costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations.\nIn the United States, we are subject to stringent standards, laws and other regulations, including those relating to health, product performance and safety, labor, employment, privacy and data security, anti-bribery, consumer protection, taxation, customs, logistics and other operational matters. In addition, operating in foreign jurisdictions requires compliance with similar laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, in the United States and abroad, are complex and often vary widely by jurisdiction, making it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently or will in the future be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations by us, or any of our suppliers or licensees, may restrict our ability to import products, require a recall of our products, lead to fines or otherwise increase our costs, negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, materially limit our ability to operate our business or result in adverse publicity. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires us to devote significant time, financial and management resources, and to update our processes and programs, in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, all of which could affect the manner in which we operate our business or adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation matters, which may relate to consumer protection, employment practices and intellectual property infringement and which may include a class action, and we are subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business operations. Often, these cases raise complex factual and legal issues and, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims have merit, legal proceedings may be expensive and require significant management time.\nAlso, the restaurant industry requires compliance with a variety of federal, state and local regulations. In particular, all of our Tommy Bahama restaurants, including our Marlin Bar concept, serve alcohol and, therefore, maintain liquor licenses. Our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of that restaurant. Additionally, as a participant in the restaurant industry, we face risks related to food quality, food-borne illness, injury, health inspection scores and labor relations. The negative impact of adverse publicity relating to allegations of actual or perceived violations at one of our restaurants may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants, as well as the image of the Tommy Bahama brand as a whole.\nRegardless of whether any allegations of violations of the laws and regulations governing our business are valid or whether we ultimately become liable, we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these and other issues, such as those relating to our social responsibility and sustainability initiatives.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nMany factors, such as economic conditions, fashion trends, consumer preferences, the financial condition of our wholesale customers and weather, make it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products. In order to meet the expected demand for our products in a cost-effective manner, we make commitments for production several months prior to our receipt of these goods and often in advance of firm commitments, if any, from wholesale customers. Depending on the demand levels for our products, we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered or that we have in our inventory, which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices and through off-price channels. These events, many of which could be exacerbated as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our products or if we are unable to access our products when we need them, for example due to a third party manufacturer\u2019s inability to source materials or produce goods in a timely fashion or as a result of delays in the delivery of products to us, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales, any of which could harm our business. These risks relating to inventory may also escalate as our direct to consumer sales continue to increase as a proportion of our consolidated net sales, given the absence of purchase commitments for direct to consumer-designated inventory.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property, as well as certain contractual arrangements, including licenses, and other proprietary intellectual property rights, have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers. In Fiscal 2019, 93% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark. Therefore, our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property. We rely on laws in the United States and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands.\nWe devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts. Despite these efforts, we regularly discover products that infringe our proprietary rights or that otherwise seek to mimic or leverage our intellectual property. Counterfeiting and other infringing activities typically increase as brand recognition increases. Counterfeiting and other infringement of our intellectual property could divert away sales, and association of our brands with inferior counterfeit reproductions or third party labels could adversely affect the integrity and reputation of our brands.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. As we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of the manufacture, distribution and marketing of our brands\u2019 products, we could become subject to litigation or challenge based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, including by various third parties who have acquired or claim ownership rights in some of our trademarks internationally. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful or would otherwise affect our operations, we may be required to pay damages, royalties, license fees or other costs to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time. Litigation and other legal action of this type, regardless of\nwhether it is successful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of the attention of our management and other resources.\nFluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials, labor and freight may materially increase our costs.\nWe and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices. The principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, linens, wools, silk, other natural fibers, synthetics and blends of these materials. The prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them. The cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, can fluctuate. We historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices, and in recent years, we have seen significant variability in the costs of certain raw materials, including cotton. These pricing fluctuations could continue in future years.\nWe have also seen increases in the cost of labor at many of our suppliers in recent years, as well as in freight costs, and as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may experience increases in our supply chain and/or distribution and logistics functions. Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of increases in our cost of goods sold through sourcing initiatives and by selectively increasing the prices of our products, these product costing pressures, as well as other variable cost pressures, may materially increase our costs, and we may be unable to fully pass on these costs to our customers.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we had approximately 6,100 employees worldwide, of which approximately 70% are retail store and restaurant employees. The employment and employment-related costs associated with our employees are a significant component in our SG&A, particularly of our retail store and restaurant operations. Employment costs are affected by labor markets, as well as various federal, state and foreign laws governing matters such as minimum wage rates, overtime compensation and other requirements. In addition, in recent years, there has been significant political pressure and legislative action to increase the minimum wage rate in many of the jurisdictions in which our stores are located. Any increases in our employment costs, as a result of market conditions or otherwise, may materially increase our costs, reduce the profitability of our operations and/or adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing real estate for our retail stores and restaurants, which generally consist of long-term leases negotiated at prevailing market rents.\nAn integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands. Net sales from our retail stores and restaurants were 47% of our consolidated net sales during Fiscal 2019.\nWe lease all of our retail store and restaurant locations. Successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends, in part, on our ability to identify desirable, brand appropriate locations; the overall ability of the location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make sales volume profitable; our ability to negotiate satisfactory lease terms and employ qualified personnel; and our ability to timely construct and complete any build-out and open the location in accordance with our plans. A decline in the volume of consumer traffic at our retail stores and restaurants, due to economic conditions, shifts in consumer shopping preferences or technology, a decline in the popularity of malls or lifestyle centers in general or at those in which we operate, the closing of anchor stores or other adjacent tenants or otherwise, could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin and results of operations. In addition, as and when we seek to open new retail stores and restaurants, we compete with others for favorable locations, lease terms and desired personnel. As consumer shopping patterns continue to negatively impact bricks and mortar retail traffic generally, the competition for premium retail space in long-term sustainable locations continues to increase. Our growth may be limited if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level or the local market reception to a new retail store opening is inconsistent with our expectations.\nOur retail store and restaurant leases generally represent long-term financial commitments, with substantial costs at lease inception for a location\u2019s design, leasehold improvements, fixtures and systems installation and recurring fixed costs. On an ongoing basis, we review the financial performance of our retail and restaurant locations in order to determine whether continued operation is appropriate. Even if we determine that it is desirable to exit a particular location, we may be unable to close an underperforming location due to continuous use clauses and/or because negotiating an early termination would be cost prohibitive. In addition, due to the fixed-cost structure associated with these operations, negative cash flows or the closure of a retail store or restaurant could result in write-downs of inventory, impairment of leasehold improvements, impairment of operating lease assets and/or other long-lived assets, severance costs, lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Furthermore, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could force us to close retail stores and/or restaurants in desirable locations.\nOur geographic concentration of retail stores, restaurants and wholesale customers for certain of our brands exposes us to certain regional risks.\nOur operations and retail and restaurant locations are heavily concentrated in the United States (202 of 224 locations as of February 1, 2020, with 97% of our consolidated net sales in the United States during Fiscal 2019) and, within the United States in certain geographic areas, including Florida, California, Texas and Hawaii for our Tommy Bahama operations (75 of 140 domestic stores and 13 of 16 restaurants, including Marlin Bars, are in these states as of February 1, 2020) and Florida, Massachusetts and Virginia for our Lilly Pulitzer operations (31 of 61 retail stores as of February 1, 2020). Additionally, the wholesale sales for each of Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide are also geographically concentrated, including in geographic areas where we have concentrations of our own retail store locations. Due to these concentrations, we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions, including general economic conditions, weather patterns, natural disasters, public health crises, changing demographics and other factors.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers, vendors and wholesale customers may be affected by changes in weather patterns, natural or man-made disasters, public health crises, war, terrorism or other catastrophes.\nOur sales volume and operations and the operations of third parties on whom we rely, including our suppliers, vendors and wholesale customers, may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions, natural or man-made disasters, public health crises, war, terrorist attacks, including heightened security measures and responsive military actions, or other catastrophes which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, the concentration of a significant proportion of our retail stores and wholesale customers in certain geographic regions, including a resort and/or coastal focus in Tommy Bahama\u2019s, Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s and Southern Tide's operations, the concentration of our sourcing operations and the concentration of our distribution center operations, the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe hold licenses for the use of other parties\u2019 brand names, and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names.\nWe have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names, including Kenneth Cole, Dockers, Cole Haan and Nick Graham in Lanier Apparel, to market some of our products. During Fiscal 2019, sales of products bearing brands licensed to us accounted for 6% of our consolidated net sales and 65% of Lanier Apparel\u2019s net sales. When we enter into these license and design agreements, they generally provide for short contract durations (typically three to five years); these agreements may include options to extend the term of the contract but, when available, are generally subject to our satisfaction of certain contingencies (e.g., minimum sales thresholds) that may be difficult for us to satisfy. Competitive conditions for the right to use popular trademarks means that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration, that the terms of any renewal will not result in operating margin pressures or reduced profitability or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use\nother desirable trademarks. The termination or expiration of a license agreement would cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license, which could be material, and in certain cases could also result in an impairment charge for related assets, leave us with underutilized overhead and/or adversely impact existing synergies.\nOur license agreements generally require us to receive approval from the brand\u2019s owner of all design and other elements of the licensed products we sell prior to production, as well as to receive approval from the brand owner of distribution channels in which we may sell and the manner in which we market and distribute licensed products. Any failure by us to comply with these requirements could result in the termination of the license agreement.\nIn addition to certain compliance obligations, all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year, which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products. If these thresholds are not met, our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved. In addition, our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties, and we are unable to control the quality, style or image of these goods. If licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates, or the licensors otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution or marketing, our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline.\nAs a global apparel company, we may experience fluctuations in our tax liabilities and effective tax rate.\nAs a global apparel company, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We record our income tax liability based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations, which requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation. In addition, we may from time to time modify our operations in an effort to minimize our global income tax exposure. Our effective income tax rate in any particular period or in future periods may be affected by a number of factors, including a shift in the mix of revenues, income and/or losses among domestic and international sources during a year or over a period of years; changes in tax laws and regulations and/or international tax treaties; the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions; the difference between the income tax deduction and the previously recognized income tax benefit related to the vesting of equity-based compensation awards; and the resolution of uncertain tax positions, any of which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nFurther, changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws and compliance with new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense, cash flows and operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could materially impact our tax obligations in those countries.\nOur international direct to consumer and licensing operations may present risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nWe operate Tommy Bahama retail stores in Australia and Canada, and are closing our remaining retail operation in Japan during Fiscal 2020. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices related to international operations and there are risks associated with doing business in international markets, including lack of brand recognition in certain markets; understanding fashion trends and satisfying consumer tastes; market acceptance of our products, which is difficult to assess immediately; establishing appropriate market-specific operational and logistics functions; managing compliance with the various legal requirements; staffing and managing foreign operations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; obtaining governmental approvals that may be required to operate; potentially adverse tax implications; and maintaining proper levels of inventory. If we are unable to properly manage these risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may also elect to enter into retail or wholesale distribution arrangements, or joint ventures, with third parties for certain markets. For example, a third party operates Tommy Bahama retail stores in the United Arab Emirates. Any such arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our reliance on the\noperational skill and expertise of a local operator, the ability of the joint venture or operator to manage its employees and appropriately represent our brands in those markets and any protective rights that we may be forced to grant to the third party, which could limit our ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of such a relationship.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If any of our international operations, or our employees or agents, violates such laws, we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nWe make use of debt to finance our operations, which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results.\nOur levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business, investments in our operations and working capital needs, and may increase in the future under our existing credit facility or potentially under new facilities, or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements may change.\nOur indebtedness includes, and any future indebtedness may include, certain obligations and limitations, including the periodic payment of principal, interest and unused line fees, maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations. The negative covenants in our debt agreements limit our ability to incur debt; guaranty certain obligations; incur liens; pay dividends; repurchase common stock; make investments; sell assets; make acquisitions; merge with other companies; or satisfy other debt. These obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that may be less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plans and planning for, or reacting to, change.\nIn addition, we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our variable rate U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. Our exposure to variable rate indebtedness may increase in the future, based on our debt levels and/or the terms of future financing arrangements. Further, an increase in the interest rate environment would require us to pay a greater amount towards interest, even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same.\nA portion of our indebtedness under the U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement at any time may be based on LIBOR, which is the subject of recent proposals for reform or elimination. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear what the impact, if any, might be if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods.\nThe continued growth of our business also depends on our access to sufficient funds. We rely on cash flow from operations and borrowings under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and investment activities. As of February 1, 2020, we had $322 million in unused availability under our U.S. Revolving Credit Agreement. If our cash flow from operations decline significantly, including any such decline related to reduced store traffic and widespread store and restaurant closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if the need arises in the future to finance expenditures in excess of those supported by the existing credit facility, we may need to seek additional funding, which may be through debt or equity financing. Our ability to obtain that financing will depend on many factors, including prevailing market conditions, our financial condition and, depending on the sources of financing, our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions. The terms of any such financing or our inability to secure such financing could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies.\nLabor-related matters, including labor disputes, may adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of labor disputes in our own operations or in those of third parties with whom we work. Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner, and our new retail store and restaurant growth is dependent on timely construction of our locations. While we are not subject to any organized labor agreements and have historically enjoyed good employee relations, there can be no assurance that we\nwill not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future with our non-unionized employees. In addition, potential labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced, shipping ports or transportation carriers create risks for our business, particularly if a dispute results in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing, shipping and selling seasons. Further, we plan our inventory purchases and forecasts based on the anticipated timing of retail store and restaurant openings, which could be delayed as a result of a number of factors, including labor disputes among contractors engaged to construct our locations or within government licensing or permitting offices. Any potential labor dispute, either in our own operations or in those of third parties on whom we rely, could materially affect our costs, decrease our sales, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nOur international operations, including foreign sourcing, result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to certain currency exchange risks in conducting business outside of the United States. The substantial majority of our product purchases are from foreign vendors and are denominated in U.S. dollars. If the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future, then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase and we may be unable to pass this increase on to customers, which would negatively impact our margins. However, if the value of the U.S. dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product, the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies, and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices. Additionally, currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance.\nWe received U.S. dollars for 97% of our product sales during Fiscal 2019, with the remaining sales primarily related to our retail operations during the year in Canada, Australia and Japan. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings reported in our consolidated statements of operations, even though the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods. In addition, to the extent that a stronger U.S. dollar increases product and other costs, products sold in foreign markets in the local currency may realize lower gross margins.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges or disruptions in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may adversely affect our relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current employees and others.", "PERMNO": 34948, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "OXM"}
