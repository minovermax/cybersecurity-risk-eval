Risk Factors\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nOur disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, expected market growth, new technologies, industry partnerships, foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements and financial results.\nAny or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements. Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements. Actual future results may materially vary.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases. Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nRISK FACTORS:\nNEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES\nWe may pursue new product or service initiatives that develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected\nIn order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in security provisioning of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we must invest ahead of others while the market is developing and uncertain. If these markets develop more slowly than planned, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies and this may affect the results of our existing business.\nWe may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:\n\u00b7 burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition\n\u00b7 diverting management\u2019s attention from other business concerns\n\u00b7 failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies\n\u00b7 lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers\n\u00b7 entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of the acquired company\n\u00b7 additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architecture\nFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position. For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders. We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.\nDelays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.\nWe develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services. Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.\nFor example, we may encounter these problems:\n\u00b7 technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems\n\u00b7 inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel\n\u00b7 delays or failures to perform by us or third parties, including some smaller early stage companies, involved in our development projects\n\u00b7 dependence on large semiconductor companies for cooperation and support to securely provisoin their devices. These companies must enable us with specific technical information, and support Data I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners.\n\u00b7 development of new products or services that are not accepted by the market\nThese problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs.\nFailure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results.\nProduct and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:\n\u00b7 new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers\n\u00b7 reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection. Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer\u2019s ability to successfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing. This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP. Data I/O is working with semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss.\n\u00b7 electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading\n\u00b7 adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements\n\u00b7 customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate\n\u00b7 customer adoption of newer semiconductor device technologies such as UFS memory or device interface methods such as PCI, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers\n\u00b7 more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services\nIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.\nFailure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirements\nQuality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide. For example, although we currently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorous requirements. In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide. If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nWe rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements.\nBecause of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management\u2019s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.\nTechnological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market. We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.\nTHIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS\nIf we do not develop and enhance our relationships with security partners, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to timely develop new and cost effective managed and secure programming solutions.\nAs we enter new areas in managed and secure programming, we need to complement our skills and expertise with partners\u2019 expertise in security. Some of these partners are early stage companies that are operating with more limited capital and/or management expertise than established firms. Other partners are very large companies where prioritizing work with us may be difficult in light of competing priorities. For some of our earlier stage partners, we have demanded unique product features and capabilities in exchange for NRE payments, pre-paid royalties, marketing incentives and sales cooperation. If our partners are unable to develop and deliver solutions that we need to integrate into our managed and secure programming solutions, our products might be delayed, we might have to locate alternate partners and suppliers or develop the technology ourselves, and we would still be responsible for paying any related pre-paid royalties or NRE payments.\nIf we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security provisioning systems comply with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support. As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND, e-MMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices. Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or if semiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on security provisioning. Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us. As we develop more security solutions, we will need to partner more closely with semiconductor manufacturers.\nOur reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs.\nCertain parts or software used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or software are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business. For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements. Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.\nCertain of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives. Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important. Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.\nMARKET CONDITIONS\nA decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.\nOur business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits. These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending. In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers\u2019 business may fail, resulting in non-payment. Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.\nInternational sales represented approximately 92%, 88% and 90% of net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 92% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins\n\u00b7 economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation\n\u00b7 migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements\n\u00b7 tariffs and taxes\n\u00b7 Bi-lateral and Multi-lateral trade agreements\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations\n\u00b7 longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable\n\u00b7 compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n\u00b7 product safety and other certification requirements\n\u00b7 difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations\n\u00b7 civil unrest, political and economic instability\nBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables. We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.\nThe European Union and European Free Trade Association (\u201cEU\u201d) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (\u201cCE\u201d). As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9). We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.\nWe have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash. Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances. Tax reform and the effect of the \u201cDeemed Repatriation\u201d have been included in our 2017 financial statements. Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.\nOPERATIONS\nQuarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter. Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues. We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer. Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.\nOther factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:\n\u00b7 increased competition\n\u00b7 timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures\n\u00b7 product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors\n\u00b7 market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services\n\u00b7 production constraints\n\u00b7 quality issues\n\u00b7 labor or material constraints\n\u00b7 timing of significant orders\n\u00b7 timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements\n\u00b7 sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution\n\u00b7 civil unrest, war or terrorism\n\u00b7 health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)\n\u00b7 customers\u2019 budgets\n\u00b7 changes in accounting rules, tax or other legislation\n\u00b7 adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates\n\u00b7 cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers\u2019 products\n\u00b7 general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products\n\u00b7 expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations\n\u00b7 facilities relocations\nDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses in one of the last five years and three of the last ten years. We operate in a cyclical industry. We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.\nThe loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations.\nWe have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China. We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. In China, our workers are \u201cleased\u201d with the arrangements made under the \u201cFSCO\u201d labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.\nWe may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.\nOur past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.\nWe believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period. In the event we require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the $6.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions. Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time. Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.\nTherefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.\nOur stock price may be volatile and, as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nThe stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nCyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems. The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.\nCyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems. We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nFailure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock\u2019s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company. We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2017. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.\nWhile we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.\nGovernment regulations regarding the use of \"conflict\" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.\nRegulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals. Our goal is for our products to be conflict free. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell. Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us. We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management\u2019s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.", "PERMNO": 28629, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "DAIO"}
