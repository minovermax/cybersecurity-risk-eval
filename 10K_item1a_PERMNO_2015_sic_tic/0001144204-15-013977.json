RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe biopharmaceutical industry in China is strictly regulated and changes in such regulations, including banning or limiting plasma products, may have a material and adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability.\nThe principal raw material of our existing and planned biopharmaceutical products is human source plasma, which, due to its unique nature, is subject to various quality and safety control risks which include, but are not limited to, contaminations and blood-borne diseases. In addition, current technology cannot eliminate entirely the risk of biological hazards inherent in plasma that are not currently known or for which screens are currently commercially available, which could result in a widespread epidemic due to blood infusion. As a result, the biopharmaceutical industry in China is strictly regulated by the government. The regulatory regime regulates the process of administrative approval of medicine and its production, and includes laws and regulations such as the PRC Pharmaceutical Law, the Implementation Rules on the PRC Pharmaceutical Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Blood Products. These laws and regulations require entities producing blood products to comply strictly with certain hygienic standards and specifications promulgated by the government. In the event that human plasma is discovered to be not compliant with the government\u2019s hygienic standards and specifications, the health department may revoke its approval of the blood product, or otherwise limit the use of such blood product. Changes in these laws and regulations, including banning or limiting plasma products, could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, revenues and profitability.\nIf the biopharmaceutical products we sell are found to be contaminated, our operation, revenues and profitability would be severely and adversely affected and we may be subject to civil and criminal liabilities.\nWe currently obtain plasma from human donations to our plasma stations in Shandong, Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces. If any of our human donors is infected with diseases, then the plasma from such donor may be infected. Although we pre-screen all donors in order to ensure that they are not infected with HIV and hepatitis C and have not contracted liver disease, screening tests may fail to identify and exclude from our supply the plasma from infected donors due to technical limitation and human errors. If such contaminated plasma is not appropriately screened out, our entire plasma supply for the relevant plasma station may become contaminated. If the plasma from our collection is found to be contaminated and we sell biopharmaceutical products made from that plasma, we could be subject to civil liability from suits brought by consumers. Further, we may lose our registration and have criminal liability if we are found by the government to have been criminally negligent. If this occurs, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our supply of quality plasma is interrupted, our results of operations and profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe production of plasma products relies on the supply of plasma of suitable quality. For 2014, 2013, and 2012, the cost of plasma we used for production accounted for approximately 80%, 74%, and 74%, respectively, of total production cost. The supply and market prices of plasma may be adversely affected by factors such as heightened or new regulatory restrictions, higher living standards or outbreaks of diseases, any of which would impact our costs of production. We may not be able to pass on any resulting increase in costs to our customers and therefore any substantial fluctuation in supply or market prices of plasma may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe may not be able to carry on our business if we lose any of the required permits and licenses. Moreover, Huitian has suspended the production at its production facilities for technical upgrade and will apply for a new GMP certificate upon the completion of the upgrade; however, it may not be able to obtain the certificate, which would prevent it from carrying on its business at these facilities and harm our profitability.\nWe and Huitian are required to obtain from various PRC governmental authorities certain permits and licenses, including permits for pharmaceutical manufacturing and GMP certificates for each of our plants, as well as pharmaceutical distribution permits.\nEach of the production facilities operated by us and Huitian is required to obtain a GMP certificate for its pharmaceutical production activities. In February 2011, CFDA enacted the New GMP Standard, which has significantly increased standards for quality control, documentation, and overall manufacturing processes that applied to us and each of our production facilities as of December 31, 2013. In order for us to meet the New GMP Standard, we have upgraded the related production facilities of Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang, which obtained the renewed GMP certificates and resumed commercial production of plasma products in June 2013 and March 2014, respectively. However, Huitian suspended its production in late 2013 and is constructing a new production facility to meet the New GMP Standard. The suspension of Huitian\u2019s production may have a negative effect on its business and profitability, which may in turn affect the income we derive from our minority investment in Huitian and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have also obtained permits and licenses and GMP certificates required for the manufacturing and sales of our products. Our permits and licenses are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC governmental authorities, and the compliance standards may be subject to change from time to time. We intend to apply for the renewal of such permits and licenses when required by applicable laws and regulations. However, there is no guarantee that we may renew such permits and licenses in a timely manner, or at all. If we are unable to renew our permits and licenses or failed an inspection which would impair our permits and licenses, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, any changes in compliance standards, or any new laws or regulations that may prohibit or render it more restrictive for us to conduct our business or increase our compliance costs may adversely affect our operations and profitability. For example, we expect our on-going compliance cost to increase under the New GMP Standard as compared to the previous standard. As a result, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not have discretion to increase the prices of certain of our products, which are subject to price controls by the PRC government.\nRetail prices of certain pharmaceutical products are subject to various regulations. According to the \u201cRegulations on Controlling Blood Products\u201d promulgated by the PRC State Council in 1996, regional offices of the Pricing Bureau and the PRC Ministry of Health have the authority to regulate retail prices for controlled plasma products. In addition, retail prices of pharmaceutical products fully or partially covered under the national insurance system are also subject to retail price ceilings set out in the National (Medical) Insurance Catalog, or the NIC, which may be adjusted by NDRC, from time to time. The hospitals which are participants of the national insurance program cannot sell the products to patients at prices exceeding such retail price ceilings. In addition, provincial governments often establish a tender price ceiling for products sold to hospitals based on, among other things, regional living standards, cost of production of the manufacturers and the corresponding retail price ceiling. The prices at which we sell directly to hospitals and distributors and the distributor\u2019s wholesale prices cannot exceed the applicable tender price ceiling. Five of our principal products, including human albumin, IVIG, human rabies immunoglobulin, human tetanus immunoglobulin and factor VIII, are included in the NIC and are also subject to tender price ceilings. Two of our principal products, placenta polypeptide and human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, although not included in the NIC, are also subject to tender price ceilings in certain PRC provinces. In addition, NDRC may adjust the retail price ceilings applicable to our products from time to time, and any downward adjustment of our product prices implemented by the government may have a negative impact on our results of operations. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d for further details.\nWe do not have discretion to increase the prices we charge our customers and distributors for price-controlled products above the relevant controlled tender price ceiling. Although we may appeal to the local governments for price increases, such increases are only granted on a case-by-case basis and there is no guarantee that we would obtain any such relief. We may not be able to obtain government approval to increase our prices even if the cost of manufacturing our products increases as a result of increases in the cost of raw materials or other costs, and, if we were unable to obtain relief, our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected. If the margin of any of these products becomes prohibitively low, we may stop manufacturing such product, which may further adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe may fail to obtain, maintain or renew required licenses and permits for our plasma stations. In addition, if we fail to adequately monitor our plasma stations, follow proper procedures or comply with safety requirements, we may be subject to sanctions by the government, civil and criminal liability. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and prospects.\nWe currently operate 10 plasma stations through Shandong Taibang and two plasma stations through Guizhou Taibang. Huitian, a company in which we hold a minority interest, has three plasma stations in Shaanxi Province. To enable growth in our sales, we are seeking opportunities to build more plasma stations. The operation of plasma stations is highly regulated and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain, maintain and renew the required licenses and permits for existing and new plasma stations in desirable locations or in a timely manner, if at all. While we monitor our plasma intake procedures through frequent unscheduled inspections of our stations, there remain risks that our plasma stations may fail to comply with hygiene and procedural requirements for plasma screening, collection, storage and tracking. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we may lose our plasma collection permits or incur criminal liability if we are found by the government to have been criminally negligent. In the case of plasma contamination, we may also be subject to civil liability from suits brought by consumers of our biopharmaceutical products. In addition, failure to comply with hygiene and procedural requirements may cause harm to donors, who may contract diseases from other donors, among other things. Any such incident may subject us to government sanctions, civil or criminal liabilities. If any of these events were to occur, our business, reputation and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be adversely affected if our plasma products fail to pass inspection in a timely manner.\nThe PRC government inspects each batch of our plasma products before we can ship it to our customers. CFDA has quality standards which require the regulators to assess, among other things, the appearance, packing capacity, thermal stability, pH value, protein content and percentage of purity of the product. We must strictly comply with relevant rules and regulations throughout the lifecycle of each product including plasma collection, delivery, production and packaging. Government regulators typically take more than a month to inspect one batch of plasma products. The process begins when the regulator randomly selects samples of our products and delivers them to the PRC National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, or NICBPB, for testing, and the process ends when the products are given final approval by NICBPB. In the event that the regulators delay the approval of or reject our products or change the requirements such that we are unable to comply, our operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be adversely affected.\nWe face risks relating to general domestic and global economic conditions. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers, suppliers and creditors.\nWe currently generate sufficient operating cash flows, which, coupled with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant working capital. However, any uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions, including any disruption in credit markets, may impact our ability to manage normal relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers, suppliers and creditors. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct acquisitions or make other investments. Such disruptions may also adversely impact our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, despite the positive impact of insurance schemes, our products are still not affordable to many patients and fewer patients can afford these products when economic conditions worsen in China. As our economy grows, we expect more Chinese people will become consumers of medical treatments and procedures, including procedures requiring human plasma. However, any potential global economic slowdown may result in slower economic growth in China and an unfavorable economic environment, which in turn may make our products less affordable to more patients and result in an overall decreased demand for our products. Such reductions and disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional capital or if we experience any shortage of raw materials in future years, we may be unable to proceed with our long-term business plan and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations or further business expansion.\nWe anticipate that we may seek additional working capital to support our long-term business plan, which includes identifying suitable targets for horizontal or vertical mergers or acquisitions, so as to enhance the overall productivity and benefit from economies of scale. Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if any, will vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business during the period and payment terms with our customers. We may not be able to obtain adequate levels of additional financing, whether through equity financing, debt financing or other sources, especially during times of market contraction. To raise funds, we may need to issue new securities which could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Additional financings could result in significant dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to our current outstanding securities or that contain covenants that would limit our operations and strategy. If we are unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to implement our long-term business plan, develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a timely basis. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations.\nIn addition, our production volume, capacity utilization and future expansion are affected by the supply of raw materials, especially plasma. If we experience any shortage of plasma supply or fail to secure sufficient plasma supply for our production, we may not be able to fully utilize our production capacity or proceed with our expansion plans.\nOur cash flow could be negatively affected as a result of our extension of relatively long payment terms to customers that we believe are credit worthy.\nAs is customary in our industry, we extend relatively long payment terms (up to six months) to customers that we believe are credit worthy. Our accounts receivable, net of our allowance for doubtful accounts, as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were approximately $19.4 million, $17.3 million, and $11.2 million, respectively. A majority of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals and clinics. Although we attempt to establish appropriate reserves for our receivables, those reserves may not prove to be adequate in view of actual levels of bad debts. The failure of our customers to pay us timely would negatively affect our cash flow and working capital, which could in turn adversely affect our business.\nIf the distributors on whom we rely do not purchase our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe sell a third of our products in China through our network of approximately 171 distributors located in about 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions throughout China. While we have established working relationships with many of our distributors and strictly regulate their sales and marketing activities by annual distribution agreements, there are no restrictions in these distribution agreements preventing our distributors from also sourcing products produced by our competitors. Our own marketing and sales staff work to develop and maintain relationships with our distributors, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships. For 2014, 2013, and 2012, sales to distributors represented approximately 34.6%, 33.2%, and 33.6%, respectively, of our sales of plasma products. If a number of our distributors cease to purchase our products and we are unable to find suitable replacements, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to successfully research and develop new biopharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our future growth.\nWe believe that the successful development of biopharmaceutical products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to be promising in the early phases of research and development may fail to be commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, the research and development cycle for any new medicine is a relatively lengthy process. In our experience, the process of conducting research and various tests on new products before obtaining a Certificate of New Medicine from CFDA and subsequent procedures may take approximately three to five years. There is no assurance that our future research and development projects will be successful or that they will be completed within the anticipated time frame or budget. Also, there is no guarantee that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities for the production of our newly developed products. Even if such products could be successfully commercialized, there is no assurance that they will be accepted by the market as anticipated.\nSome of our owned or leased properties have title defects or non-compliance, which could adversely affect our business operations.\nSome of our owned or leased properties have title defects or non-compliance. We cannot assure you that we will be able to rectify such defects and non-compliance in a timely manner or at reasonable costs, if at all. In addition, we use properties built on collectively owned rural land for two of our plasma collection stations. Under PRC laws, collectively owned rural land may not be used for commercial purposes and we may be required to vacate and seek other space to house our collection facilities. We plan to construct facilities on a new site and relocate one of the two collection stations. For the other collection station, under the lease agreement for the collectively owned rural land among us, the local government and the economic collective which owns the land, the economic collective is required to assist us in securing legal rights to use such land. If the economic collective fails to perform its obligations under the lease agreement, or the lease agreement is deemed to be void, voidable or otherwise unenforceable, or if ownership disputes or claims regarding the land otherwise arise, we may be required to relocate our collection station. Any disputes or claims relating to our owned or leased properties or land or any efforts in securing alternative sites and properties could divert our resources and management\u2019s attention from our regular business operations. In addition, we may not be able to secure alternative sites and properties, if required, in a timely manner or at reasonable costs, which could adversely affect our business operations.\nOur financial position and operations may be materially and adversely affected if our product liability insurance does not sufficiently cover our liabilities.\nUnder current PRC laws, manufacturers and vendors of defective products in China may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such products. Pursuant to the General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, or the PRC Civil Law, which became effective in 1987, a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability.\nThe Product Quality Law of the PRC, or the Product Quality Law, was enacted in 1993 and revised in 2000. The Product Quality Law was enacted to protect the rights and interests of end-users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. Under the Product Quality Law, manufacturers who produce defective products may be subject to fines and production suspension, and in severe cases, be subject to criminal liability and may have their business licenses revoked.\nThe PRC Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers, or the Consumers\u2019 Rights Law, was enacted in 1993 to further protect the legal rights and interests of consumers in connection with the purchase or use of goods and services. All businesses, including our business, must observe and comply with the Consumers\u2019 Rights Law.\nThe Tort Liability Law of the PRC was enacted in December 2009, which states that manufacturers are liable for damages caused by defects in their products. If the defects are caused by third parties such as transporters or storekeepers, manufactures may be entitled to claim for compensation from such third parties after paying the compensation amount to the consumer.\nWe maintain two product liability insurance policies for sales in China for Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang\u2019s products in the amount of $3.2 million (RMB20 million) each. If our products are found to be defective and our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover a successful claim against us, our financial position and operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nProduct liability claims or product recalls involving our products could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of plasma products. Plasma is a biological substance that is capable of transmitting viruses and pathogens, whether known or unknown. Therefore, our plasma and plasma products, if not properly collected, tested, pathogen-inactivated, processed, stored or transported, could cause serious disease and possibly death to patients. Further, there are viral and other infections of plasma which may escape detection using current testing methods and which are not susceptible to inactivation methods. Any infection of disease by persons using our products could result in claims against us. Since our establishment in 2002, we have been subject to three lawsuits filed by patients who were treated with our products and received blood and/or plasma transfusions. In two of these cases, we were ordered to contribute a portion of the compensation for the patients even though the courts did not find that our products were defective or caused the patients\u2019 illness. The required contribution by us was immaterial in these two cases. For the third case, we settled with the patient and contributed to a small portion of the compensation made by all the defedents who might be responsible for the case. We cannot assure you that there will be no future claims against us or that we will always succeed in defending against such claims. Furthermore, the presence of a defect in a product could require us to carry out a recall of such product.\nA product liability claim, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, or a product recall could result in substantial financial losses, civil and criminal liabilities, administrative sanctions, revocation of business and product permits and licenses, negative reputational repercussions and an inability to retain customers. If our products are found to be defective and our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover a successful claim against us, our financial position and operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to intense competition and may encounter increased competition from both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises if PRC regulators relax the approval process for plasma products or international trade restrictions. A change in our competitive environment could adversely affect our profitability and prospects.\nWe face intense competition from local and foreign entities that manufacture and sell products that compete with ours in China. These competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, expanded manufacturing and marketing capabilities and more experience than we do. The plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly regulated, and although we believe that compliance with the regulatory requirements pose a competitive barrier to enter into the Chinese market, over time, however, there may be new entrants. If the government relaxes these restrictions and allows more competitors to enter into the market, these competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, more manufacturing and marketing capability and experience than us. Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected if (i) competition intensifies, (ii) competitors reduce prices to gain market share, or (iii) competitors develop new products having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which are more effective or less costly than ours.\nIn addition, we also face competition from imported products. Since 2009, there has been a substantial increase in volume of imported human albumin in China, which competes in domestic human albumin market. In addition, we compete with foreign biopharmaceutical manufacturers that set up production facilities in China and compete directly with us. The increased supply of both domestic and foreign biopharmaceutical products in China may result in lower sales or lower prices for our products. There is no assurance that we will remain competitive or that our profitability and prospects will not be adversely affected.\nWe depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key employees and senior management could harm our business.\nOur success, to a certain extent, is attributable to the expertise and experience of our senior management and key research and technical personnel who carry out key functions in our operation. If we lose the service of any of our senior management or key research or technical personnel or fail to attract additional personnel with suitable experience and qualification, our business operations and research capability may be adversely affected.\nWe have a Secondment Agreement with the Shandong Institute, which is expected to terminate upon the future privatization of the Shandong Institute, for certain of our employees. If the Secondment Agreement is breached or terminated, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and on our financial results.\nThe Shandong Institute provided us with 63 of our employees, including certain key management personnel, out of our total of approximately 1,684 employees as of December 31, 2014, pursuant to a secondment agreement, or Secondment Agreement, dated October 28, 2002, between Shandong Taibang and the Shandong Institute. Pursuant to the Secondment Agreement, we are responsible for the salaries of these employees, as well as for their social benefits such as insurance. Our Secondment Agreement with the Shandong Institute will expire on the earlier of October 2032 or the privatization of the Shandong Institute, which was originally scheduled to occur before the end of 2008. However, the privatization of the Shandong Institute has been delayed indefinitely due to delay by the Shandong Department of Health in implementing the privatization plan. Upon expiration or termination of the Secondment Agreement, we plan to hire the seconded employees directly. However, we cannot assure you that all of the employees will accept our employment offers at that time. Guangli Pang, Shandong Taibang\u2019s chief executive officer is employed through the Secondment Agreement. Although none of our seconded employees have indicated that they do not plan to continue working for us after the privatization, if the Secondment Agreement is terminated or expires and we are unable to hire those employees or their replacements on time, our operations, as well as our financial results, may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nSelective acquisitions form part of our strategy to further expand our business. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire additional companies, products or technologies. Future acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new companies into ours would require significant attention from our management. The diversion of our management\u2019s attention and any difficulties encountered in any integration process could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Future acquisitions would expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with the integration of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the diversion of resources from our existing businesses and technologies, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, and potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, customers and suppliers as a result.\nWe may lose our competitive advantage and our operations may suffer if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of, or disputes over, our intellectual property or proprietary information.\nWe regard our intellectual property, particularly our patents and trade secrets, to be of considerable value and importance to our business and our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brands and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our patents and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we held 48 issued patents and had 11 pending patent applications in China for certain manufacturing processes and packaging designs. We may not be able to successfully obtain the approval of the PRC authorities for our patent applications. As of December 31, 2014, we also had 9 trademarks registered in China.\nWhile we are not aware of any infringement on our intellectual property and we have not been notified by any third party that we are infringing on their intellectual property, our ability to compete successfully and to achieve future revenue growth will depend, in significant part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technologies is difficult and expensive. The steps we have taken may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights.\nThe legal regime in China for the protection of intellectual property rights is still at its early stage of development. Despite many laws and regulations promulgated and other efforts made by China over the years to tighten up its regulation and protection of intellectual property rights, private parties may not enjoy intellectual property rights in China to the same extent as they would in many Western countries, including the United States, and the enforcement of such laws and regulations in China has not achieved the levels reached in those countries. The administrative agencies and the court system in China are not well-equipped to deal with violations or handle the nuances and complexities between compliant technological innovation and noncompliant infringement.\nWe also rely on confidentiality agreements with our management and employees to protect our confidential proprietary information. However, the protection of our intellectual property may be compromised as a result of:\n\u2022 departure of any of our management members or employees in possession of our confidential proprietary information;\n\u2022 breach by such departing management member or employee of his or her confidentiality and non-disclosure undertaking to us;\n\u2022 infringement by others of our proprietary information and intellectual property rights; or\n\u2022 refusal by relevant regulatory authorities to approve our patent or trademark applications.\nAny of these events or occurrences may have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our patents, trademarks, confidential proprietary information or similar proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of any such litigation may not be in our favor. Given the relative unpredictability of China\u2019s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in China, there is no guarantee that we would be able to halt any unauthorized use of our intellectual property through litigation in a timely manner.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly and we may lack the resources required to defend against such claims. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such infringement claims, we may be required to pay damages, modify our products or suspend the production and sale of such products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to modify our products on commercially reasonable terms.\nFinally, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands, and profitably exploit our products.\nA disruption in the supply of utilities, fire or other calamity at our manufacturing plant would disrupt production of our products and adversely affect our sales.\nOur products are manufactured at our production facilities located in Tai\u2019an, Shandong Province and Guiyang, Guizhou Province in China. While we have not in the past experienced any calamities which disrupted production, any disruption in the supply of utilities, in particular, electricity or power supply, or any outbreak of fire, flood or other calamity resulting in significant damage at our facilities would severely affect our production and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance policies covering losses with respect to damages to our properties and products. We do not have insurance coverage for inventories of raw materials or business interruption. There is no assurance that our insurance would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses.\nIf we do not maintain strong financial controls, investor confidence in us may decline and our stock price may decline as a result.\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which must also contain management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing the financial statements must also attest to the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls.\nA report of our management and attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 were effective. We have in the past and may in the future discover material weakness in our internal controls. For example, we identified material weaknesses related to review controls on the accounting for income taxes and derivative instrument valuation as described under Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2010, which were subsequently remediated in 2011 as described under Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. However, there is no guarantee that these remedies will continue to be effective. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could result in us not being able to accurately report our financial results, prevent or detect fraud or provide timely and reliable financial and other information pursuant to the reporting obligations we have as a public company, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could reduce investors\u2019 confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could result in lawsuits being filed against us by our stockholders, otherwise harm our reputation or negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nPending disputes regarding Guizhou Taibang\u2019s equity ownership against us, if not resolved in our favor, could result in significant dilution to our shareholding percentage in Guizhou Taibang.\nGuizhou Jie\u2019an Company, or Jie\u2019an, a minority shareholder of Guizhou Taibang, filed several lawsuits against Guizhou Taibang over the years, seeking to, among other requests, register 1.8 million shares in Guizhou Taibang, approximately 2% of Guizhou Taibang\u2019s registered capital, under Jie\u2019an\u2019s name with the local Administration of Industry and Commerce, or AIC. Some of these cases were ruled in our favor and others were still pending as of the date of this report. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings-Dispute with Jie\u2019an over Certain Capital Injection into Guizhou Taibang\u201d below for details. If these ongoing cases are ruled in Jie\u2019an\u2019s favor, our ownership interest in Guizhou Taibang may be diluted to 71% and Jie\u2019an may be entitled to receive its claimed damages of RMB18.3 million (approximately $3.0 million) (being its claimed share of Guizhou Taibang\u2019s accumulated dividend distributions associated with the 1.8 million shares), and the acrrued interest from the date when Jie\u2019an\u2019s capital contribution was deemed effective till December 31, 2014 from Guizhou Taibang. In addition, as a result of the appellate court\u2019s unfavorable ruling in one of the lawsuit with Jie\u2019an in December 2014, Guizhou Taibang paid RMB18.0 million (approximately $2.9 million) in February 2015 into an escrow held by the trial court pending further appeal for such case. Although we, based on our PRC litigation counsel\u2019s assessment, do not expect Jie\u2019an to prevail in these pending litigations, we cannot assure you that the final judgment will be in our favor. If Guizhou Taibang is ordered to register the 1.8 million shares for Jie'an, our ownership interest in Guizhou Taibang will be diluted to 71%, and we may be required to pay Jie\u2019an accumulated dividends of RMB18.3 million (approximately $3.0 million) and related interest expenses (being its claimed share of Guizhou Taibang\u2019s accumulated dividend distributions associated with the 1.8 million shares and the acrrued interest from the date when Jie\u2019an\u2019s capital contribution was deemed effective till December 31, 2014) from Guizhou Taibang. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to Jie\u2019an of RMB5.0 million (approximately $0.8 million) as received funds in respect of the 1.8 million shares in dispute, RMB1.4 million (approximately $0.2 million) for the over-paid subscription price paid by Jie\u2019an and RMB3.3 million (approximately $0.5 million) for the accrued interest.\nIn addition, Guizhou Taibang has a pending lawsuit with an individual investor who is among cerain alleged strategic investors in the Equity Purchased Agreement signed in May 2007. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings-Dispute with Certain Individual Investor Over Certain Capital Injection into Guizhou Taibang.\u201d Such individual investor claimed for 14.35% ownership interests in Guizhou Taibang and the corresponding entitlement to share dividend distributions since 2007. Such individual investor\u2019s claims have been repeatedly denied by both the trial court and the appellate court (which is the PRC Supreme Court). He has, however, applied to the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to seek an appeal by the PRC Supreme Procuratorate to the PRC Supreme Court for an ultimate re-trial on his behalf. The PRC Supreme Procuratorate has recently accepted his application and is currently reviewing such application. We are in the process of preparing written response to such application. While we, based on our PRC litigation counsel\u2019s assessment, do not expect such investor to prevail in this pending re-trial application process, we cannot assure you that the PRC Supreme Procuratorate will decide not to appeal for re-trial or the final outcome of such ultimate re-trial by the PRC Supreme Court (if the PRC Supreme Procuratorate decides to appeal for re-trial) will continue be in our favor. In case such investor\u2019s shareholder status is established through the re-trial process, our ownership interests in Guizhou Taibang will be significantly diluted to 66.29% and our control of Guizhou Taibang may be weakened. In addition, such investor may be entitled to receive his claimed pro rata share of Guizhou taibang\u2019s dividend distributions and the accrued interests although he has not specified the amount of the claimd damages for that in either the appeal to the PRC Supreme Court or the application to the PRC Supreme Procuratorate. As of December 31, 2014, Guizhou Taibang had maintained, on its balance sheet, payables to such investor of RMB34.2 million (approximately $5.6 million) as originally received funds from such investor in respect of the shares in dispute, RMB15.9 million (approximately $2.6 million) for the accrued interest, and RMB0.3 million (approximately $55,647) for the 1% penalty imposed by the agreement for any breach in the event that Guizhou Taibang is required to return the original investment amount to such investor.\nRISKS RELATING TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nChanges in China\u2019s political or economic situation could harm us and our operating results.\nEconomic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of the country. The reformed economic infrastructure and legal systems, however, may be subject to abrupt adjustments by the government. These adjustments, especially in the following areas, could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability:\n\u2022 Level of government involvement in the economy;\n\u2022 Control of foreign exchange;\n\u2022 Methods of allocating resources;\n\u2022 International trade restrictions; and\n\u2022 International conflict.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or the OECD, in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy, and weak corporate governance and the lack of a flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the OECD member countries.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, most of our executive officers and directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiary.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nMost of our assets are located outside of the United States and most of our current operations are conducted in China. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors.\nThere is also uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that although recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law, recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment by PRC courts depend on treaties or reciprocity between China and the country where the judgment is made. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements with U.S. that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of U.S. judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in China will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy and any regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales effectively.\nSubstantially all of our sales are settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investments and loans, is subject to governmental approval and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividends we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nCurrently, some of our raw materials and major equipment are imported. In addition, we incur interest expense for our U.S. dollar denominated loans. In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against RMB, our costs will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, if our sales to international customers grow, we will be increasingly subject to the risk of foreign currency depreciation.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions, pay dividends to you and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nSubstantially all of our profits are earned by our PRC subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent companies.\nPRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nPursuant to the Circular on Relevant Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration of Overseas Investment and Financing and Return Investments Conducted by Domestic Residents through Overseas Special Purpose Vehicle, or Circular 37, which was promulgated by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, and became effective on July 4, 2014, (i) a PRC resident must register with the local SAFE branch before he or she contributes assets or equity interests in an overseas special purpose vehicle, or an Overseas SPV, that is directly established or controlled by the PRC resident for the purpose of conducting investment or financing; and (ii) following the initial registration, the PRC resident is also required to register with the local SAFE branch for any major change, in respect of the Overseas SPV, including, among other things, a change in the Overseas SPV\u2019s PRC resident shareholder, name of the Overseas SPV, term of operation, or any increase or reduction of the Overseas SPV\u2019s registered capital, share transfer or swap, and merger or division.\nWe have requested the beneficial holders of our stock who are PRC residents to register with the relevant branch of SAFE in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries pursuant to Circular 37 or the predecessor regulation of Circular 37, namely the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, as the case may be. As Circular 37 was recently promulgated, it remains unclear how it will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us. Therefore, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, the ability of our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 37 by our PRC resident beneficial holders.\nIn addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 37. We also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. Failure of our present or future PRC resident beneficial holders to comply with Circular 37 could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations.\nIn August 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or Circular 10, which became effective in September 2006 and was amended in June 2009. This regulation, among other things, governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, Circular 10 requires the PRC parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with Circular 10 is likely to be more time-consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to Circular 10, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction.\nCircular 10 allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders\u2019 economic interests.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nThe Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, SAT issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation on non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a Chinese natural person. Nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares. Finally, if we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax. We are actively monitoring the possibility of \u201cresident enterprise\u201d treatment for the 2014 tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.\nWe face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nSAT released a circular on December 15, 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares by nonresident companies, generally referred to as Circular 698. Circular 698, which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China. Circular 698 has the effect of taxing foreign companies on gains derived from the indirect sale of a PRC company. Where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by selling the shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country or jurisdiction that has an effective tax rate less than 12.5% or does not tax foreign income of its residents, the foreign investor must report this indirect transfer to the tax authority in charge of that PRC resident enterprise. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%.\nSAT subsequently released public notices to clarify issues relating to Circular 698, including the Announcement on Several Issues concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on the Indirect Transfers of Properties by Non-resident Enterprises, or SAT Notice 7, which became effective on February 3, 2015. SAT Notice 7 abolished the compulsive reporting obligations originally set out in Circular 698. Under SAT Notice 7, if a non-resident enterprise transfers its shares in an overseas holding company, which directly or indirectly owns PRC taxable properties, including shares in a PRC company, via an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose, such transfer shall be deemed as direct transfer of the underlying PRC taxable properties. Accordingly, the transferee shall be deemed as a witholding agent with the obligation to withhold and remit the EIT to the competent PRC tax authorities. Factors that may be taken into consideration when determining whether there is a \u201creasonable commercial purpose\u201d include, among other factors, the economic essence of the transferred shares, the economic essence of the assets held by the overseas holding company, the taxability of the transaction in offshore jurisdictions, and economic essence and duration of the offshore structure. SAT Notice 7 also sets out safe harbors for the \u201creasonable commercial purpose\u201d test.\nThere is little guidance and practical experience regarding the application of Circular 698 and the related SAT notices. For example, while the term \u201cindirectly transfer\u201d is not defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how to calculate the effective tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result, we may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and the related SAT notices and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and the related SAT notices or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698 and the related SAT notices, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other U.S. laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the relevant statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. PRC anti-corruption laws also strictly prohibit bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of the Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of the Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Particularly, most of the hospitals and inoculation centers in China are state-owned entities, which employees may be recognized as foreign government officials for the purpose of FCPA. Therefore, any payments, expensive gifts or other benefits provided to an employee of the state-owned hospital or inoculation center may be deemed violation of FCPA. Violations of FCPA or PRC anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold the Company liable for successor liability under FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nIf we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nIn recent years, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed the so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on the Company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing the Company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, the Company and business operations will be severely impacted and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in China. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located have conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the CSRC, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on the Company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nThe Chinese member firm of the KPMG network, of which our independent registered public accounting firm is also a member, may be temporarily suspended from practicing before the SEC if unable to continue to satisfy SEC investigation requests in the future. If a delay in completion of our audit process occurs as a result, we could be unable to timely file certain reports with the SEC, which may lead to the delisting of our stock.\nThe vast majority of our sales are to customers in China, and we have all of our operations in China. Certain of our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in our annual reports may be located in China, and certain audit procedures may take place within China\u2019s borders. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, is currently unable to conduct inspections in China or review audit documentation located within China without the approval of Chinese authorities. Like many U.S. companies with significant operations in China, our independent registered public accounting firm may rely on a Chinese member firm for assistance in completing the audit work associated with our operations in China.\nOn January 22, 2014, Judge Cameron Elliot, an SEC administrative law judge, issued an initial decision suspending the Chinese member firms of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, among others, from practicing before the SEC for six months as a result of their failure to provide certain including KPMG documents to the SEC because to do so would violate Chinese law. On February 12, 2014, the accounting firms filed an appeal with the SEC regarding the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. On February 6, 2015, the accounting firms agreed to pay $500,000 each to settle this yearlong dispute with the SEC, which allows them to avoid a temporary suspension of their right to audit U.S.-traded firms. As part of the settlement, the SEC censures the accounting firms, which eventually began providing the documents, and requires them to perform specific steps to satisfy SEC requests for similar materials over the next four years.\nWe cannot assure you, however, that the accounting firms, including the Chinese member firm of KPMG, will be able to continue to satisfy SEC investigation requests to its satisfaction in the future due to compliance with the PRC laws and regulations. A delay in completion of the audit process could delay the timely filing of our quarterly or Annual Reports with the SEC. A delinquency in our filings with the SEC may result in NASDAQ initiating delisting procedures, which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports included in our Annual Report may include audit documentation located in China. PCAOB currently cannot inspect audit documentation located in China and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in our Annual Report filed with the SEC. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, work papers located in China are not currently inspected by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities.\nInspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. However, the PCAOB is currently unable to inspect an auditor\u2019s audit work related to a company\u2019s operations in China and where such documentation of the audit work is located in China. As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB\u2019s oversight of our auditors through such inspections.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditors\u2019 work papers in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections. Investors may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR STOCK\nAlthough publicly traded, the trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and this low trading volume may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cCBPO.\u201d The trading market in our common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three months immediately prior to March 1, 2014, was approximately 76,179. Limited trading volume will subject our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to you.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you want to sell your holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, and this volatility may continue. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include, among others:\nl\nour earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;\nl\nchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\nl\nspeculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\nl\nsignificant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers;\nl\nstock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in our industry;\nl\ncustomer demand for our products;\nl\ninvestor perceptions of our industry in general and the Company in particular;\nl\nthe operating and stock performance of comparable companies;\nl\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\nl\nmajor catastrophic events;\nl\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\nl\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;\nl\nloss of external funding sources;\nl\nsales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders;\nl\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\nl\ninvestor perception of litigation, investigation or other legal proceedings involving us or certain of our individual stockholders or their family members.\nSecurities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. For example, in July 2008, the securities markets in the United States, China and other jurisdictions experienced the largest decline in share prices since September 2001. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us.\nOur stockholder rights plan and provisions in our currently effective certificate of incorporation and bylaws or of Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore depress the trading price of the common stock.\nUpon stockholders\u2019 approval on July 20, 2012, we have adopted amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which contained provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.\nThese provisions include, among others:\nl\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\nl\ndivision of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\nl\nelimination of the right of our stockholders to act by written consent;\nl\nprohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of the stockholders;\nl\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and\nl\nrequiring super majority stockholder vote to amend certain provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nOn January 8, 2015, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan, which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our stockholders will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created series of preferred stock. The preferred stock purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of (i) 10 business days (or a later date determined by our board of directors before the rights are separated from our common stock) after the public announcement that a person or group has become an \u201cacquiring person\u201d by acquiring beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock or (ii) 10 business days (or a later date determined by our board of directors before the rights are separated from our common stock) after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer that, if completed, would result in that person or group becoming an acquiring person. The issuance of preferred stock pursuant to this stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors. Our board of directors had previously adopted a similar sotckholder rights plan on November 19, 2012, which expired on November 20, 2014.\nIn addition, our currently-in-effect bylaws authorize our stockholders who hold 25% of our entire capital stock issued and outstanding and are entitled to vote to call a special meeting of the stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nStock prices of companies with business operations primarily in China have fluctuated widely in recent years, and the trading prices of our common stock are likely to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors.\nThe trading prices of our common stock are likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to factors beyond our control. For example, if one or more of the industry analysts or ratings agencies who cover us downgrades us or our common stock, or publishes unfavorable research about us, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts or agencies cease to cover the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline. In addition, the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other China-based, U.S.-listed health care companies may affect the volatility in the price of and trading volume for our common stock. In recent years, a number of PRC companies have listed their securities, or are in the process of preparing for listing their securities, on U.S. stock markets. Some of these companies have experienced significant volatility, including significant price declines following their initial public offerings. The trading performances of these PRC companies\u2019 securities at the time of or after their offerings may affect the overall investor sentiment towards PRC companies listed in the United States and consequently may impact the trading performance of our common stock. These broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price and volatility of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our common stock may be highly volatile for specific business reasons. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our common stock will trade. We cannot give any assurance that these factors will not occur in the future again. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we were involved in a class action lawsuit, it could divert the attention of senior management, and, if adversely determined, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 93189, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CBPO"}
