{"cik": "1091596", "company": "Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not yet known or currently believed to be immaterial may also impair Nuo Therapeutics\u2019 business. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of its common stock could decline. You should consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to Nuo Therapeutics securities.\nWe Have Limited Sources of Working Capital\nWorking capital required to implement our business plan will most likely be provided by funds obtained through offerings of our equity, debt, debt-linked securities, and/or equity-linked securities, and revenues generated by us. We may not have revenues sufficient to support and sustain our operations or that we would be able to obtain equity/debt financing in the current economic environment. If we do not have sufficient working capital and are unable to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional funds, we may delay the completion of, or significantly reduce the scope of, our current business plan; delay some of our development and clinical or marketing efforts; delay our plans to penetrate the market serving Medicare beneficiaries and fulfill the related data gathering requirement as stipulated by the Medicare CED coverage determination; delay the pursuit of commercial insurance reimbursement for our wound treatment technologies; or postpone the hiring of new personnel; or, under certain dire financial circumstances, cease our operations.\nWe May Need Substantial Additional Financing\nWe will need substantial additional capital to fund our operations. To date, we have relied almost exclusively on financing transactions to fund losses from our operations. Our inability to obtain sufficient additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and, as a result, could require us to significantly curtail or potentially cease our operations. At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.9 million, total current assets of approximately $21.9 million and total current liabilities of approximately $8.5 million. In connection with the convertible credit facility agreement we entered into with Deerfield, or the Deerfield Facility (See Note 7 - Debt for additional details), the Company is required to maintain a compensating cash balance of $5,000,000 in deposit accounts subject to control agreements in favor of the lenders. In March 2015, we received an upfront payment from Rohto of $3.0 million in exchange for an exclusive license and the right to develop and commercialize Aurix in the Japanese market. In order to do so, we paid a one-time fee of $1.5 million to Millennia to terminate their September 2009 license and distribution agreement with the Company for the Japanese market. We estimate that our current resources, expected revenue from current products, including additional revenue expected to be generated from our increased marketing efforts, royalty revenue and license fee revenue will be adequate to maintain our operations through at least 2015. However, if we are unable to increase our revenue as much as expected, or at all, we intend to consider implementing all necessary cost saving efforts which may include reductions in force or reduction of sales, marketing and related commercialization activities, to allow us to maintain operations through at least 2015. Based on our current operating plan, we would anticipate needing additional capital in early 2016. If we fail to obtain this funding we may be forced to curtail our operations. Such financing transactions may well cause substantial dilution to our shareholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the outstanding shares. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering, market reception of the Company and the likelihood of the success of its business model, of the offering terms, etc. We may not be able to obtain any such additional capital as we need to finance our efforts, through asset sales, equity or debt financing, or any combination thereof, on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, any such financing, if at all obtained, may not be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our operations. If adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, our revenues and operations and the value of our Common stock and common stock equivalents would be materially negatively impacted and we may cease our operations.\nWe Have a History of Losses and Expect to Incur Losses for the Foreseeable Future\nWe have a history of losses, are not currently profitable, and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows in the future. Although, prior to the Aldagen acquisition, we were targeting operational cash flow break-even within the foreseeable future, the acquisition of Aldagen, and the expenditures necessary to fund the discontinued clinical trial and related activities, caused us to continue to generate losses. We may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We will continue to incur expenses at current or increased levels as we seek to expand our operations, pursue development of our technologies, work to increase our sales, implement internal systems and infrastructure, and hire additional personnel. These ongoing financial losses may adversely affect our stock price.\nWe have a substantial amount of senior indebtedness. The inability to repay such indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of the date of this report, we had approximately $36.5 million of principal owing under senior secured indebtedness, evidenced by a convertible secured note held by Deerfield. The Deerfield Facility is structured as a purchase of senior secured convertible notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears in cash or, at our election, registered shares of our common stock; provided, that during the first five quarters following the closing, we have the option of having all, or any portion of accrued interest, added to the principal balance of the Deerfield Facility. The Company elected to have all of the accrued interest added to the principal balance of the Deerfield Facility until September 30, 2015 beginning with interest for the third quarter of 2014. Deerfield has the right, subject to a 9.98% beneficial ownership limitation, to convert the principal amount of the Deerfield Facility into shares of our common stock at a per share price equal to $0.52. In addition, we granted Deerfield the option to require us to redeem up to 33.33% of the total amount drawn under the Deerfield Facility, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on each of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversaries of its closing, with the option right triggered upon our net revenues failing to be equal to, or in excess of, certain quarterly milestone amounts. We also granted Deerfield the option to require us to apply 35% of the proceeds received by us in equity-raising transaction(s) to redeem outstanding principal and interest of these senior convertible notes, provided that the first $10 million so raised by us will be exempt from this put option. The note is secured by substantially all of our assets. In addition, if our net sales for any of the quarters ended September 30, 2015 or December 31, 2015 is less than the amount required by the Deerfield Facility, the lenders thereunder, in their sole discretion, may require us to prepay one-third of the aggregate amount of the first and second disbursements thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on March 31, 2016. Further, if our net sales for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2016 is less than the amount required by the Deerfield Facility, the lenders thereunder, in their sole discretion, may require us to prepay one-third of the aggregate amount of the first and second disbursements thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on March 31, 2017. If we do not have sufficient capital to pay interest and/or repay principal under the notes when they become due, then we would be in default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to raise capital in the future and our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe Have a Short Operating History and Limited Operating Experience\nWe have, only in the past few years, implemented our commercialization strategy for Aurix and have only four years\u2019 experience operating the fully integrated Angel and activAT business. Thus, we have a very limited operating history. Continued operating losses, together with the risks associated with our ability to gain new customers for our product offerings, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. We may also be forced to respond to unforeseen difficulties, such as a decreased demand for our products and services, downward pricing trends, regulatory requirements and unanticipated market pressures. Since emerging from bankruptcy and continuing through today, we are developing a business model that includes protecting our patent position, addressing our third-party reimbursement issues, developing and executing a sales and marketing program, acquiring synergistic technologies and product lines, developing other technologies covered by, or derived from, our intellectual property, and seeking strategic partnerships. Our current business model may not be able to accomplish our stated goals.\nWe May Not Be Able to Comply with the Debt Service and Loan Covenant Requirements of the Deerfield Facility Agreement, Which Could Place the Business Assets of the Company in Jeopardy\nThe Deerfield security agreement, which secures as collateral all of our assets, and which was entered into in connection with the Deerfield Facility, requires interest payments and compliance with certain covenants, including with respect to maintenance of available cash of at least $5,000,000, product revenue and others. In addition, we will have to recognize continued sales growth to satisfy our requirements under the Deerfield Facility. Failure to comply with the covenants could allow Deerfield to accelerate payment or trigger a default under the agreement, which in turn could allow Deerfield to seize all of our assets if we are unable to make required payments when required. If any key assets are seized, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the complete cessation of operations, and/or bankruptcy.\nWe Are Traded on the Over-the-Counter Market Which May Decrease the Liquidity of Our Common Stock\nOver-the-counter markets are generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, a stock exchange. There may be a limited market for our stock, which is quoted on the OTCQX, trading in our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease. Specifically, shareholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price paid for such shares or at all. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired because of the less liquid nature of the over-the-counter markets. We may not be able to complete an equity financing on acceptable terms, or at all, but if we do, the dilution from any equity financing while our shares are quoted on an over-the-counter market could be greater than if we were to complete a financing while our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange. Further, since our stock is not traded on an exchange, we are not eligible to use short-form registration statements on Form S-3 for the registration of our securities unless our market capitalization increases substantially, which could impair our ability to raise additional capital as needed.\nWe May Not Be Able to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Aldagen Acquisition\nThe acquisition of Aldagen, pursuant to which we acquired the ALD-401 RECOVER-Stroke trial and ALDH \u201cBright Cell\u201d platform, represented a significant investment by the Company. In September 2013, we announced our decision to begin a strategic reorganization of our research and development operations that involved discontinuing clinical trials of ALD-401, which focused on the RECOVER-Stroke trial and one component of the technology present in the ALDH Bright Cell platform. This discontinuation of funding was limited to the above mentioned clinical trial of RECOVER-Stroke, and does not represent a discontinuation of our efforts to develop and commercialize Bright Cell technology. Our efforts to further develop assets acquired from Aldagen, including Bright Cell technologies, will require attention and resources of non-Aldagen Nuo Therapeutics personnel, which could reduce the likelihood of achievement of other corporate goals. We may not successfully manage the various aspects of the Aldagen business, including but not limited to the clinical trial, regulatory, and other functions. Failure to maintain the Aldagen business could lead to a reduction in revenue for the Angel, activAT, and Aurix, products compared to historical levels, generate ill-will among our customer base, and therefore have a material adverse effect on us, our operations or the price of our common stock. The development efforts underway with the remaining Aldagen technology may not be successful.\nWe Rely on Several Single Source Suppliers and an Interruption in Our Supply Chain Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business\nNuo Therapeutics outsources the manufacturing of our various products, including component parts, composing the Angel Product Line, to contract manufacturers. While we believe these manufacturers to demonstrate competency, reliability and stability, one or more of them may experience an interruption or inability to provide us with the products needed to satisfy customer demand. During 2014 and 2015, we devoted substantial resources to enhancing and improving the Angel Product Line to meet new and additional regulatory requirements. During the period that we have been implementing the modifications, we were unable to meet our customer\u2019s demand for Angel devices. As a result, our sales were lower than expected and in addition, we incurred a charge to earnings of $600,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014, reflecting our expected costs for refurbishment and design improvements for the units in circulation. Although we believe that we have completed all necessary design modifications to the Angel Products, if further modifications are required, we may experience manufacturing delays and additional costs in the future. Additionally, while most of the components of Aurix are generally readily available on the open market, the reagent, bovine thrombin, is available exclusively through Pfizer. Our single source suppliers may also unilaterally raise the prices charged to use for their services. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of our products were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by our suppliers exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. While we are formulating plans to develop redundant capabilities, such capabilities will not take effect for the foreseeable future. While the Company maintains business interruption insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses which may occur as a result of any interruption in supply.\nAdverse Conditions in the Global Economy and Disruption of Financial Markets May Significantly Restrict Our Ability to Generate Revenues or Obtain Debt or Equity Financing\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty. Such conditions could reduce demand for our products which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve meaningful market penetration for Aurix and continued sales of Angel and activAT products. These conditions could also affect our potential strategic partners, which, in turn, could make it much more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration, and therefore significantly jeopardize our ability to fully develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. Global credit and capital markets continue to be relatively challenging. We may be unable to obtain capital through issuance of our equity and/or equity-linked securities, which have been a significant source of funding for us throughout our history. If we are unable to secure funding through strategic collaborations, equity investments, or debt financing, we may not be able to achieve profitability, or fund our R&D, which may result in a cessation of our operations.\nBusiness credit and liquidity have tightened in much of the world. Volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner, or to maintain operations, and result in a decrease in sales volume. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors, and business in general. Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.\nEconomic downturns or other adverse economic changes (local, regional, or national) could result in losses of portions of principal in our investment portfolio. While our investment policy requires us to invest only in short-term, low risk investments, our principal investment may be eroded, as a significant portion of these investments are in excess of federally mandated insurance.\nOur Intellectual Property Assets Are Critical to Our Success\nWe regard our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secret and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We attempt to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets by restricting access to sensitive information and requiring employees, consultants, and other persons with access to our sensitive information to sign confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology in the future. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property assets is difficult and expensive. Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future in order to protect our intellectual property assets. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any litigation matter relating to our intellectual property assets. Continuing litigation or other challenges could result in one or more of our patents being declared invalid. In such a case, any royalty revenues from the affected patents would be adversely affected although we may still be able to continue to develop and market our products. Furthermore, the unauthorized use of our patented technology by otherwise potential customers in our target markets may significantly undermine our ability to generate sales. Any infringement on or challenge to our patents or other misappropriation of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales of our commercial products and/or continue the development of our pipeline candidates.\nOur Products are Subject to Governmental Regulation\nOur success is also impacted by factors outside of our control. Our current technology and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., both federal and state, and in foreign countries by various regulatory agencies. Specifically, our devices and bio-pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the FDA and state regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and biologics that move in interstate commerce and requires that such products receive clearance or pre-marketing approval based on evidence of safety and efficacy. The regulations of government health ministries in foreign countries are analogous to those of the FDA in both application and scope. In addition, any change in current regulatory interpretations by, or positions of, state regulatory officials where our products are used could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states. The FDA will require us to obtain clearance or approval of new devices when used for treating specific wounds or marketed with specific wound-healing claims, or for other products under development.\nWe believe all our products for sale are legally marketed. As we expand and offer and/or develop additional products in the U.S. and in foreign countries, clearance or approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to introduction of any such products into the market may be required. We provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals from the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries for these products. Failure to obtain the required approvals would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nCompliance with FDA and other governmental requirements imposes significant costs and expenses. Further, our failure to comply with these requirements could result in sanctions, limitations on promotional or other business activities, or other adverse effects on our business. Further, recent efforts to control healthcare costs could negatively affect demand for our products and services.\nWe Must Comply With the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal healthcare programs to report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period for which manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by March 31, 2014. We did not timely file our required report under the Sunshine Act for this first period, and our failure to do so could subject us to certain fines and penalties as set forth below. Manufacturers are required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. If we fail to accurately and timely report this information in the future, we could suffer severe penalties. We cannot assure you that we will collect and report all data timely and accurately. If we fail to accurately report this information, we could suffer severe penalties. Any applicable manufacturer that fails to timely, accurately, or completely report the information required in accordance with the rules of the Sunshine Act is subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000, but not more than $10,000, for each payment or other transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not reported timely, accurately or completely (up to $150,000). For \u201cknowing\u201d failures to report, the penalties increase to not less than $10,000, but not more than $100,000, for each such failure (up to $1,000,000). The amount of civil monetary penalties imposed on each applicable manufacturer or applicable group purchasing organization is aggregated separately. Subject to separate aggregate totals, the maximum combined annual total is $1,150,000.\nClinical Trials May Fail to Demonstrate the Safety or Efficacy of Our Product Candidates\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of biotherapeutic products. The results of early-stage clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully progressed through initial clinical testing. For example, we discontinued further funding of the ALD-401 development program following results which demonstrated that observed improvements in the primary endpoint of the trial were not clinically or statistically significant. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates is promising, this data may not be sufficient to support approval by the U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the regulatory officials could reach different conclusions in assessing such data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the U.S. regulatory authorities, or we, may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for product candidates, or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any product candidates, has the potential to materially harm our business, and may prevent it from raising necessary, additional financing that may be needed in the future.\nA Disruption in Healthcare Provider Networks Could Have an Adverse Effect on Operations and Profitability\nOur operations and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon the ability to contract with healthcare providers on favorable terms. In any particular service area, healthcare providers could refuse to contract with Nuo Therapeutics or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, or create difficulties in meeting our regulatory requirements. In some service areas, certain healthcare providers may have a significant market presence. If healthcare providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market services or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. Provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large healthcare provider group. Any disruption in provider networks could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we have one significant customer, economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies or patterns of that customer could have a significant impact on our business and operating results.\nOne of our customer accounts for a large share of our net sales. In 2014, Arthrex, our largest customer, accounted for approximately 91% of our product sales. The concentration of our business with this customer may expose us to a material adverse effect if this customer were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason, favor competitors or new entrants, or increase their direct competition with us by expanding their own private-label business. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes. Any customer could reduce its overall purchases of our products, or otherwise seek to materially change the terms of the business relationship at any time. Any such change could significantly harm our business and operating results.\nLiquidity problems or bankruptcy of our key customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that key customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, contraction of credit availability to such customers, weak sales or other factors beyond our control, which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if our key customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce their orders from us, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract a Strategic Partner for the Further Development of Certain of Our Product Candidates\nDue to our limited resources, we have determined that the best vehicle to ultimately commercialize the various potential indications for ALDHbr, is through strategic partnerships, out-licensing, or other similar arrangements. Even if positive clinical data is eventually achieved in future clinical trials, we may not be able to come to any such agreements, or even have the resources necessary to seek such arrangements. Furthermore, even if such a strategic relationship regarding any of our products or product candidates is reached, development milestones, clinical data, or other such benchmarks may not be achieved. Therefore, these products and product candidates may never proceed toward commercialization or drive cash infusions for us, and we may ultimately not be able to monetize the patents, existing clinical data, and other intellectual property.\nThe Successful Continued Commercialization of Our Aurix System and Angel and of Any Future Product Candidates Will Depend on Obtaining Reimbursement from Third-party Payors\nIn the U.S., the market for any pharmaceutical or biologic product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies. If we cannot demonstrate a favorable cost-benefit relationship, we may have difficulty obtaining adequate reimbursement for our products from these payors. Third-party payors may also deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement for any of our products if they determine that the product is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Should we seek to expand our commercialization internationally, we would be subject to the international regulations, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement may be subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. Conducting one or more of these clinical trials would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our products.\nManaging and reducing healthcare costs has become a major priority of federal and state governments in the U.S. As a result of healthcare reform efforts, we might become subject to future regulations or other cost-control initiatives that materially restrict the price we can receive for our products. Third-party payors may also limit access and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products generally or limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nOur Efforts to Secure Unrestricted Medicare Reimbursement in a Timely and Efficient Manner May Not be Successful\nThe Aurix\u2122 system is marketed to healthcare providers. Some of these providers, in turn, seek reimbursement from third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurers. Under such healthcare systems, reimbursement is often a determining factor in predicting a product\u2019s success, with some physicians and patients strongly favoring only those products for which they will be reimbursed. In light of the foregoing and other related factors, we may not ultimately be successful with our reimbursement strategy, including, without limitation, obtaining additional necessary CMS or other regulatory approvals. For example, CMS may not determine that the evidence collected under CED is sufficient to provide unrestricted Medicare coverage for the Aurix\u2122 system and autologous PRP, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial state and business operations. If it is later determined that a new randomized, controlled trial is necessary, it could cost several millions of dollars and take multiple years to complete. We would almost certainly need to obtain additional, outside financing to fund such a trial. In any case, we may never be successful in securing unrestricted Medicare coverage for our products.\nOur Sales and Marketing Strategy for the Aurix System May Not Succeed\nIn October 2014, we relaunched our AutoloGel chronic wound care system under the Aurix\u2122 brand, as a part of our marketing plan for the commercialization of Aurix\u2122 in the U.S. chronic wound care market. Since January 2009, the sales and marketing strategy for this system was focused on intensive clinician to clinician interaction, with both prospective and existing customers, and the scientific explanation of the system\u2019s mechanism of action. However, the primary goal of this effort was to help secure the additional data necessary to obtain Medicare coverage. Following the 2012 determination by the CMS which, in essence, permitted coverage of Aurix\u2122 under its CED program, we have been positioning the Company to expand its sales efforts to address the Medicare beneficiary population. This will require selling to wound care clinics, individual physician practices, and other venues that have traditionally not been available to us due to the previously standing non-coverage determination by CMS. The Company\u2019s efforts in this new sales channel may not be successful, and even if successful, they may not yield sufficient sales and profits to realize the Company\u2019s goals and conform to its plans. If and to the extent CMS makes significant changes to its previously issued approval determinations, or we are unable to reverse the October 2014 protocol denial determination, or the currently approved protocols are not enrolled in a timely manner, our sales and marketing strategy may be adversely affected.\nOur Efforts to Secure Commercial Partners May Not Be Successful\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with larger companies regarding potential strategic partnerships involving the broad commercialization of Aurix\u2122. The resources and expertise of such a partner would greatly facilitate the capture of market share within the wound care market, but would require that the economic benefits of such a broad penetration would be shared with said partner. We may not be successful in securing such a partner. Furthermore, even if a partner is secured, the partnership may not attain the market penetration contemplated, and the profits ultimately realized by Nuo Therapeutics, if any, may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our business strategy.\nWe May Use Third-party Collaborators and Service Providers to Help us Support, Develop or Commercialize Our Product Candidates, and Our Ability to Commercialize Such Candidates May be Impaired or Delayed if such Collaborations or Engagements are Unsuccessful\nWe do presently and may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations or engagements for, among other purposes, development, data collection, analysis, and/or commercialization of our product candidates, domestically or otherwise. There can be no assurance as to our ability to utilize the data from such engagements to their potential. Nor can there be any assurance, in general, that we will be able to identify future suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In any current or future third-party collaborations, we are and would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation and engagement. For a variety of reasons outside of our control, our collaborators or third-party providers may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nThe Success of Our Products Is Dependent on Acceptance by the Medical Community\nThe commercial success of our products and processes will depend upon the medical community and patients accepting the therapies as safe and effective. The willingness of the medical community to accept or evaluate our products and processes may be impacted by our ability to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. We may not have the resources necessary to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept the therapies as safe and effective, or we are unable to raise awareness of our products and processes, our ability to sell the products may be materially and adversely affected, and the results of our operations may be adversely effected.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract and Retain Key Personnel\nOur future success depends on the ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, including sales representatives. We have retained a team of highly qualified officers and consultants, but may not be able to successfully retain all of them, or be successful in recruiting additional personnel as needed. Our inability to do so will materially and adversely affect the business prospects, operating results and financial condition of the Company. Our ability to maintain and provide additional services to our customers depends upon our ability to hire and retain business development and scientific and technical personnel with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in regenerative biological therapy technologies. Competition for such personnel is intense; we compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies with greater access to resources. Our inability to hire additional qualified personnel may lead to higher recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such personnel. These increased costs may reduce our profit margins or make hiring new key personnel impractical.\nLegislative and Administrative Action May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Company\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. We cannot predict what other legislation relating to our business or to the health care industry may be enacted, including legislation relating to third-party reimbursement, or what effect such legislation may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We expect federal and state legislators to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems, and possibly adopt legislation affecting further changes in the health care delivery system. Such laws may contain provisions that may change the operating environment for hospitals and managed care organizations. Health care industry participants may react to such legislation by curtailing or deferring expenditures and initiatives, including those relating to our products. Future legislation could result in modifications to the existing public and private health care insurance systems that would have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement policies discussed above. With growing pressures on government budgets due to the current economic downturn, government efforts to contain or reduce health care spending are likely to gain increasing emphasis. Several members of the current presidential administration and Congress are espousing support for cost-containment measures that could have significant implications for healthcare therapies, including our current and future products. If enacted and implemented, such measures could result in decreased revenue from our products and decrease potential returns from our research and development initiatives. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully neutralize any lobbying efforts against any initiatives we may have with governmental agencies.\nWe Could Be Affected by Malpractice or Product Liability Claims\nProviding medical care entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other claims. We do not control or direct the practice of medicine by physicians or health care providers who use our products and do not assume responsibility for compliance with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to physicians. There is no assurance that claims, suits or complaints relating to the use of our products, and treatment administered by physicians, will not be asserted against us in the future. The production, marketing and sale, and use of our products entails risks that product liability claims will be asserted against us. These risks cannot be eliminated, and we could be held liable for any damages that result from adverse reactions or infectious disease transmission. Such liability could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We currently maintain professional and product liability insurance coverage, but the coverage limits of this insurance may not be adequate to protect against all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain professional and product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nOur Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace\nIn the market for biotechnology products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors. Other companies have developed or are developing products that may be in direct competition with our current product line. Biotechnology development projects are characterized by intense competition. Thus, we may not be the first to the market with any newly developed products and we may not successfully be able to market these products. If we are not able to participate and compete in the regenerative biological therapy market, our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. Recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, may be the basis for developments that will compete with our products.\nDevelopment of Our Aldagen Product Candidates is Subject to Uncertainty Because Each is Derived from Human Bone Marrow, a Source Material That is Inherently Variable\nThe number of ALDHbr \u201cBright Cell\u201d cells and the composition of the ALDHbr cell population from bone-marrow vary from patient to patient. Such variability in composition could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our Aldagen product candidates derived from a patient\u2019s bone-marrow or to establish and meet acceptable specifications for release of the product candidate for treatment of a particular patient. As a consequence, the development and regulatory approval process for these product candidates could be delayed or may never be completed.\nIf We Determine That Our Intangible Assets Have Become Impaired in the Future, Our Total Assets and Earnings Could Be Adversely Affected.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had recorded goodwill of $1.1 million and intangible assets, net of $28.7 million, primarily as a result of the February 2012 acquisition of Aldagen. In June 2014, following the discontinuance of our ALD-401 trials, we concluded that the initial fair value of the Aldagen related trademarks of approximately $1.8 million, and IPR&D of approximately $3.7 million, was impaired. As a result an impairment charge of approximately $4.7 million was taken in the three months period ending June 30, 2014. Goodwill represents the purchase price of acquisitions in excess of the amounts assigned to acquired tangible or intangible assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. Finite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets indicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe Have Only Limited Experience Manufacturing Our Aldagen Product Candidates. We May Not Be Able to Manufacture Our Aldagen Product Candidates in Compliance With Evolving Regulatory Standards or in Quantities Sufficient for Commercial Sale\nComponents of therapeutic products approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP as required by the FDA. Manufacturers of cell-based product candidates, such as our Aldagen product candidates, also must comply with the FDA\u2019s current good tissue practices, or cGTP. In addition, we may be required to modify our manufacturing process from time-to-time for our product candidates in response to FDA requests. Manufacture of live cellular-based products is complex and subjects us to significant regulatory burdens that may change over time. We may encounter difficulties in the production of our Aldagen product candidates due to our limited manufacturing capabilities. We have only limited manufacturing experience with our Aldagen product candidates, and we currently do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support commercialization of any of our Aldagen product candidates. These difficulties could reduce sales of our Aldagen products, if they are approved for marketing, increase our costs or cause production delays, any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability.\nIf we successfully obtain marketing approval for any Aldagen product candidates, we may not be able to efficiently produce sufficient quantities of these products to meet potential commercial demand. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential demand for these products. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. We may also encounter difficulties in the commercial-scale manufacture of all of our product candidates. We are currently developing new processes and are in discussions with other companies to develop new instruments to improve our manufacturing efficiency. Improving the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing process and the cell sorters and other instruments we use is a key element of our business plan. However, we may not be able to develop process enhancements on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to develop these improvements, we could face significantly higher capital expenditures than we anticipate, increased facility and personnel costs and other increased operating expenses. We may need to demonstrate that our product candidates manufactured using any new processes or instruments are comparable to our product candidates used in clinical trials. Depending on the type and degree of differences, we may be required to conduct additional studies or clinical trials to demonstrate comparability.\nIn addition, some changes in our manufacturing processes or procedures, including a change in the location where a product candidate is manufactured, generally require prior FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval for determining our compliance with cGMP and cGTP. We may need to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of Aldagen our product candidates.\nWe May Use Third-party Collaborators to Help us Develop or Commercialize Our Product Candidates, and Our Ability to Commercialize Such Candidates May be Impaired or Delayed if Collaborations are Unsuccessful\nWe may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and for the international development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, we may not be able to commercialize ALD-201 successfully without entering into an arrangement with a third party to provide an approved method of administration. We may not be able to identify suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In any future third-party collaboration, we would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nEthical and Other Concerns Surrounding the Use of Stem Cell-based Therapy May Negatively Affect Public Perception of Us or Our Product Candidates, thereby Reducing Potential Demand for Our Products\nThe commercial success of our product candidates, which are based on adult stem cells, will depend in part on general public acceptance of the use of stem cell-based therapy for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. The use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue for research and stem cell therapy has been the subject of substantial national and international debate regarding related ethical, legal and social issues. We do not use embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue in any of our product candidates, but the public may not be able to, or may fail to, differentiate our use of adult stem cells from the use by others of embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue. This could result in a negative perception of our company or our product candidates. Some people have raised ethical concerns about the use of donated human tissue in a commercial setting, which could also negatively affect the perception of our product candidates and inhibit their commercialization in a successful manner.\nIf Our Patent Position Does Not Adequately Protect Our Product Candidates or Any Future Products, Others Could Compete Against Us More Directly, Which Would Harm Our Business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates. Issued patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or a third party may circumvent any such issued patents. The patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation and recent court decisions introduce uncertainty in the strength of patents owned by biotechnology companies. The legal systems of some foreign countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.\nThe claims of the issued patents that are licensed to us, and the claims of any patents which may issue in the future and be owned by or licensed to us, may not confer on us significant commercial protection against competing products. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. For instance, the two issued U.S. patents relating to our product candidates are limited to a particular chemistry in the manufacturing process. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. To the extent a competitor can develop similar products using a different chemistry, these patents will not prevent others from directly competing with us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of our product candidates, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. For instance, one of our patents relating to our technology will expire in 2019. To the extent our product candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such product candidates, those product candidates would not be protected by patents beyond 2019 and we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which may provide less protection of our competitive position. Similar considerations apply in any other country where we are prosecuting patents, have been issued patents, or have licensed patents or patent applications relating to our technology. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do laws of the U.S.\nIf We Are Unable to Protect the Confidentiality of Our Proprietary Information and Know-how, Our Competitive Position Would be Impaired\nA significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. The background technologies used in the development of our product candidates are known in the scientific community, and it is possible to duplicate the methods we use to create our product candidates. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position.\nIf We Infringe, or Are Alleged to Infringe, Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties, Our Business Could be Harmed\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties, and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.\nFurther, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our research, development or commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the licensee would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also affect our potential collaborators to the extent we have any collaborations then in place, which would also affect the success of the collaboration and therefore us. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and technology.\nUncertainties Resulting from the Initiation and Continuation of Patent Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Ability to Compete in the Marketplace\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the following:\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs that we expect to be promising;\n\u00b7 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 our third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7 we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 we may be subject to a more complex regulatory process, since stem cell-based therapies are relatively new and regulatory agencies have less experience with them than with traditional pharmaceutical products;\n\u00b7 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u00b7 our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to halt or terminate the trials.\nAny Product for Which We Obtain Marketing Approval Will be Subject to Extensive Ongoing Regulatory Requirements, and We May Be Subject to Penalties if We Fail to Comply with Regulatory Requirements or if We Experience Unanticipated Problems with Our Products, When and if Any of Them Are Approved\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP and cGTP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements relating to product labeling, advertising and promotion, and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to additional limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval. In addition, approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u00b7 restrictions on product distribution;\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 recall of products;\n\u00b7 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure;\n\u00b7 injunctions; or\n\u00b7 imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nFailure to Obtain Regulatory Approval in International Jurisdictions Would Prevent Us from Marketing Products Abroad\nWe may in the future seek to market some of our product candidates outside the U.S. In order to market our product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must submit clinical data concerning our product candidates and obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval from foreign regulators may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product candidate be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases this may include approval of the price we intend to charge for our product, if approved. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively affect the regulatory process in other countries. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize any products in any market and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.\nOur Business Involves the Use of Hazardous Materials That Could Expose Us to Environmental and Other Liability\nOur manufacturing facility located in Durham, North Carolina (currently under sublease) is subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including chemicals, micro-organisms and various radioactive compounds used in connection with our R&D activities. In the U.S., these laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Test Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In the European Union, these laws include RoHS. Accidental contamination or injury to our employees and third parties from hazardous materials may occur. If our products do not comply with the European substance restrictions, we could become subject to fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and contract damage claims. In addition, we could be prohibited from shipping non-compliant products into the European Union, and be required to recall and replace any products already shipped, if such products were found to be non-compliant which would disrupt our ability to ship products and result in reduced revenue. We do not have insurance to cover claims arising from our use and disposal of these hazardous substances other than limited clean-up expense coverage for environmental contamination due to an otherwise insured peril, such as fire.\nThe Sale of Our Common Stock to Lincoln Park May Cause Substantial Dilution to Our Existing Stockholders and the Sale of the Shares of Common Stock Acquired by Lincoln Park Could Cause the Price of Our Common Stock to Decline\nIn February 2013, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lincoln Park whereby we could, but are not required to, sell shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park over 30 month period up to a maximum aggregate amount of $15 million. The number of shares ultimately offered for sale by Lincoln Park is dependent upon the number of shares we elect to sell to Lincoln Park under the purchase agreement and the availability of the resale registration statement. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, sales of shares of our common stock by Lincoln Park may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. After it has acquired shares under the purchase agreement, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Sales to Lincoln Park by us pursuant to the purchase agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by Lincoln Park , or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park and the purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us.\nVolatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, and fluctuates widely in price in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially include, among others:\n\u00b7 our ability or inability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 the dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional equity financings;\n\u00b7 investor perception of our company and of the industry;\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the U.S. or overseas;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u00b7 general economic, political and market conditions.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nWe May Likely Issue Additional Equity or Debt Securities Which May Materially and Adversely Affect the Price of Our Common Stock\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have used, and will likely continue to use, our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock to fund working capital needs or to acquire technology, product rights or businesses, or for other purposes. If additional equity and/or equity-linked securities are issued, particularly during times when our common stock is trading at relatively low price levels, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Exercise of Warrants or Certain Conversion Features Issued to Deerfield in Connection with the Facility Agreement May Cause Substantial Dilution to Our Existing Stockholders,\nWe issued Deerfield warrants to purchase a total of 92,615,385 shares of our common stock in connection with the Facility Agreement. Warrants to purchase 25,115,385 shares were issued to Deerfield on March 31, 2014, and warrants to purchase 67,500,000 shares of common stock were issued to Deerfield on June 25, 2014. Each warrant has an expiration date of seven years from the applicable date of issuance, is initially exercisable at $0.52 per share, and the number of shares issuable upon their exercise is subject to certain adjustments. Deerfield also has the right to convert the principal amount of the Facility Agreement into shares of our common stock at a per share price equal to $0.52. The maximum number of shares of our common stock that can be issued pursuant to the conversion of the Deerfield facility is 67,307,692 shares; the maximum number of shares of our common stock that can be issued pursuant to the terms of the Deerfield warrants is 92,615,385 shares. The exercise of these warrants or conversion rights may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nThere is a Limited Public Trading Market for Our Common Stock\nThe average daily trading volume in our common stock has historically been relatively low. If low trading volume is persistent, it could be difficult to sell a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time at the market prices prevailing immediately before such shares are offered. Shareholders may be required to hold shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of common stock could lower the prevailing market price of our common stock. This would limit or perhaps prevent our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities. Additionally, we have significant numbers of outstanding warrants and options that, if exercised and sold, could put additional downward pressure on the common stock price. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for life sciences companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and it may adversely affect the price of our common stock. These broad market fluctuations may reduce the demand for our stock and therefore adversely affect the price of our securities, regardless of operating performance.\nWe are Subject to Anti-Takeover Provisions and Laws\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock or delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer or proxy contest, which may negatively affect our common stock price.", "PERMNO": 90750, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUOTQ"}
