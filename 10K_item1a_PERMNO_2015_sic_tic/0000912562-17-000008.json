{"cik": "912562", "company": "GIBRALTAR INDUSTRIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nFuture results and the market price for the Company's common shares are subject to numerous risks, many which are driven by factors that cannot be controlled or predicted. The following discussion, as well as, other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cPart II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,\u201d describe certain business and other risks affecting the Company. Consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the Safe Harbor Statement at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in conjunction with reviewing the forward-looking statements and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business operations and market for our securities could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial in our operations.\nMacroeconomic factors outside of our control may adversely affect our business, our industry, and the businesses and industries of many of our customer and suppliers.\nMacroeconomic factors have a significant impact on our business, including our ability to generate profitable margins, customer demand and the availability of credit and other capital. Our operations are subject to the effects of domestic and international economic conditions including government monetary and trade policies, as well as, the relative debt levels of the U.S. and the other countries which form the market for our products. The changing costs of energy, in particular the depressed price of oil plus other commodities, has, and may continue to, negatively impact demand for our expanded metal products. In addition, the recent fluctuation of the U.S. dollar impacts the prices we charge and costs we incur to export and import products. We are unable to predict the impact on our business of changes in domestic and international economic conditions. The construction market appears to have stabilized. However, as discussed in this and prior reports, the markets in which we operate have been challenging over the past few years and the possibility remains that the domestic or global economies, or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales, may continue to be slow or could deteriorate, which could result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur amount of leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nWe had total indebtedness of $209.6 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $209.2 million is long-term debt. Our current level of indebtedness and the debt we may need to incur in the future to fund strategic acquisitions, investments or for other purposes could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because the loans under our Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate. Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nOur significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors which have less debt; and\n\u2022\nAny increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specific financial ratios.\nOur debt instruments impose operational and financial restrictive covenants on us which restrict our ability to respond to changes or take certain actions and may adversely affect our operations.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our 6.25% Notes contain several financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends.\nA significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate these covenants. A covenant violation would require a waiver from our lenders, which could result in incurring additional financing fees that would be costly and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. If a waiver was not provided, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nWe make estimates in accounting for contracts and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings.\nRevenue representing approximately 26% and 17% of 2016 and 2015 sales, respectively, were accounted for using the percentage of completion, cost-to-cost method of accounting. Under this method, we recognize revenue as work progresses toward completion as determined by the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. Changes in these required estimates could have a material adverse effect on sales and profits. Any adjustments are recognized in the period in which the change becomes known using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. For contracts with anticipated losses at completion, we establish a provision for the entire amount of the estimated remaining loss and charge it against income in the period in which the loss becomes known. Amounts representing performance incentives, penalties, contract claims and the impacts of scope change negotiations are considered in estimating revenues, costs and profits when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Due to the substantial judgmental estimates involved with this process, our actual results could differ materially or could be settled unfavorably from our estimates.\nWe rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our net sales. The loss of those customers would adversely affect our business.\nOur ten largest customers accounted for approximately 30%, 34%, and 31%, of our net sales during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, with our largest customer, a retail home improvement center, accounting for approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales during both 2016 and 2015 and 12% of our consolidated net sales for 2014.\nA loss of sales due to decreased demand from the construction market, the home repair and remodel market, any significant customer in these markets, or a decrease in the prices that we can realize from sales of our products to customers in these markets could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. The end markets we serve have been and are expected to continue to be cyclical, with product demand based on numerous factors such as seasonal weather, availability of credit and capital, interest rates, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, unemployment levels, and other factors beyond our control. Although our customers periodically provide indications of their product needs and purchases, they generally purchase our products on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can be terminated at any time. The loss, bankruptcy, or significant decrease in business from any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our gross profit, net income, and cash flow.\nThe principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on product functionality, quality, price, raw material and inventory availability, and the ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by customers. We compete in our principal markets with companies of various sizes, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do and some of which have better established brand names in the markets we serve. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services or enhanced products at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross profit, net income, and cash flow and cause us to lose market share.\nOur future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material costs. We may not be able to pass on increased raw material costs to our customers.\nOur principal raw materials are commodity products consisting of steel, aluminum, and resins, which we purchase from multiple primary suppliers. The commodity market as a whole is cyclical, and, at times, availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs.\nIn an environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will impact the amount of any commodity price increases we can pass on to our customers. In the event of rapidly decreasing raw material prices, we may be left to absorb the cost of higher cost inventory as customers receive reduced pricing related to decreases in raw material costs. To the extent we are unable to match our costs to purchase raw materials to prices given to our customers, the profitability of our business and resulting cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to information system security risks and cyber intrusions and other information system threats could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon information systems technology and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, in which we distribute information internally and also to our customers and suppliers. We use this distributed information for a number of important functions, including among other things inventory procurement and control, management of production, scheduling of deliveries, human resource and legal compliance matters, and recording and reporting financial and other disclosures required by the SEC. In addition, we collect and store significant amounts of confidential data and information regarding our employees, customers and suppliers, some of which is personally identifiable. This information technology and data is subject to theft, damage, or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, malicious computer code, such as worms, viruses and Trojan horses, security breaches, and defects in design. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends upon the security, reliability and functionality of our information systems and networks.\nWe have taken various measures to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions, to secure our systems and networks from damage from malicious computer code, and to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems and networks. Nevertheless, such measures cannot provide absolute security due to software defects, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Advanced cyber-security threats, sometimes developed and exploited by criminal enterprises and foreign government intelligence agencies, are constantly evolving to attack newly discovered flaws in the security design of software. The vendors of the software we use support their products by developing updates that address security flaws, but they may not become aware of the flaw until after a number of companies experience an intrusion through means of the flaw. Therefore we cannot assure you that we can detect or prevent all attempts to access our systems and networks and misappropriate or damage our data. A security breach, system failure, or corruption of our systems and networks could prevent us from conducting our business or otherwise negatively impact our operations and financial results. In addition, cyber attacks could threaten, or even impair, the integrity and value of our trade secrets and other sensitive intellectual property, as well as reveal personally identifiable information of our employees and customers.\nWe rely on subcontractors and suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.\nSome of our contracts with customers involve subcontracts with other companies, on which we rely for performing a portion of the services we provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by our subcontractors or customer concerns with the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Similarly, failure by our suppliers to deliver raw materials, components or equipment parts may affect our ability to meet our customers' needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability. Failure of our raw materials or components to conform to our specification could also result in delays in our ability to timely deliver and may have an adverse impact on our relationships with our customers, and our ability to fully realize the revenue expected from sales to those customers.\nOur strategy depends on identification, management and successful integration of future acquisitions.\nHistorically, we have grown through a combination of internal growth plus external expansion through acquisitions. Although we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities in accordance with our business strategy, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, or, if we do, that we will be able to negotiate successfully the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or integrate the acquisition into our existing operations. Failure to integrate any acquisition successfully may cause significant operating inefficiencies, incur unforeseen obligations, loss of customers, and could adversely affect our profitability. Consummating an acquisition could require us to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing, which could increase our interest expense and reduce our cash flows and available funds.\nSystems integration and implementation issues could disrupt our internal operations.\nIn connection with the acquisitions we make, we customarily must integrate legacy information technology systems of the acquired business with our information technology infrastructure, and in some cases, implement new information technology systems for the business. In addition, as the functionality of available information systems increases, we may need to implement significant upgrades or even replace some of our primary information technology systems across significant parts of our businesses and operations. The implementation of new information technology solutions could lead to interruptions of information flow internally and to our customers and suppliers while the implementation project is being completed. Any failure to integrate legacy systems of acquisitions or to implement new systems properly could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the unexpected loss of any member could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior executive and divisional management teams. The unexpected loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed. We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel other than Frank G. Heard, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nWe could incur substantial costs in order to comply with, or to address any violations of, environmental, health and safety laws.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations sometimes involves substantial operating costs and capital expenditures, and any failure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations, including claims arising from the businesses and facilities that we have sold. We sometimes use hazardous and regulated substances such as petroleum products, hydraulic fluids, and solvents in our operations and are responsible for the proper handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. For certain businesses we have divested, we have provided limited indemnifications for environmental contamination to the successor owners. We have also acquired and continue to acquire businesses and facilities to add to our operations. While we sometimes receive indemnification for pre-existing environmental contamination, the party providing the indemnification may not have sufficient resources to cover the cost of any required measures. Certain facilities of ours have been in operation for many years and we may be liable for remediation of any contamination at our current or former facilities; or at off-site locations where wastes have been sent for disposal, regardless of fault or whether we, our predecessors or others are responsible for such contamination. We have been responsible for remediation of contamination at some of our locations and, while such costs have not been material to date, the cost of remediation of any these and newly-discovered contamination cannot be quantified, and we cannot assure you that it will not materially affect our profits or cash flows. Changes in environmental laws, regulations or enforcement policies, including without limitation new or more stringent regulations affecting disposal of hazardous substances and waste, greenhouse gas emissions or use of fossil fuels, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nLabor disruptions at any of our major customers or at our own manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nMany of our customers have unionized workforces and could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, slow-downs, and strikes. A labor disruption at one or more of our customers could interrupt production or sales by that customer and cause the customer to halt or limit orders for our products and services. Any such reduction in the demand for our products and services would adversely affect our net sales, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn addition, approximately 11% of our own employees are represented by unions through various CBAs. Three of the Company's six CBAs expired and were successfully renegotiated in 2016. None of our CBAs expire until April 30, 2018. It is likely that our unionized employees will seek an increase in wages and benefits at the expiration of these agreements, and we may be unable to negotiate new agreements without labor disruption or on terms favorable to us. In addition, labor organizing activities could occur at any of our facilities. If any labor disruption were to occur at our facilities, we could lose sales due to interruptions in production and could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our net sales, results of operations, and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations that may impact our cash flow.\nOur net sales are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters primarily as a result of reduced activity in the building industry due to inclement weather. In addition, quarterly results may be affected by the timing of shipments of large customer orders. Therefore, our cash flow from operations may vary from quarter to quarter. If, as a result of any such fluctuation, our quarterly cash flows were significantly reduced, we may not be able to service our indebtedness or maintain covenant compliance.\nEconomic, political, and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our financial results.\nAlthough the large majority of our business activity takes place in the United States, we derive a portion of our revenues and earnings from operations in other countries, and are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales during the year ended December 31, 2016. We have facilities in Canada, China and Japan. We believe that our business activities outside of the United States involve a higher degree of risk than our domestic activities. The risks of doing business in foreign countries include deterioration of foreign economic conditions, uncertainty over the stability of the Eurozone and China, the potential for adverse changes in the local political climates, in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the United States or in governmental policies, laws or regulations, terrorist activity that may cause social disruption, logistical and communications challenges, costs of complying with a variety of differing laws and regulations, difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations, deterioration of foreign economic conditions, currency rate fluctuations, foreign exchange restrictions, differing local business practices and cultural considerations, restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply, and changes in duties or taxes. Adverse changes in any of these risks could adversely affect our net sales, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFuture terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nTerror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could lead to economic instability, decreased capacity to produce our products and decreased demand for our products. From time to time, terrorist attacks worldwide have caused instability in global financial markets. Also, our facilities could be subject to damage from fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters. Such interruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial results.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability, product warranty and other claims, and other legal proceedings.\nWe are involved in product liability, product warranty and other claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our Company. We cannot assure you that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIf we are required to take additional non-cash impairment charges to earnings, such charges could be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We also test goodwill in each of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite-lives for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value. In recent years, we have recorded significant non-cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of reductions in the estimated fair values of certain businesses. Should the markets for our products deteriorate or should we decide to invest capital differently than as expected, or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to our earnings in the future, which could be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe expiration, elimination or reduction of solar rebates, credits and incentives may adversely impact our business.\nA variety of federal, state and local government agencies provide incentives to promote electricity generation from renewable sources such as solar power. These incentives are in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives which help to motivate end users, distributors, system integrators and others to install solar powered generating systems. Any changes to reduce, shorten or eliminate the scope and availability of these incentive programs could materially impact the demand for our related products, our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79862, "SIC": 3310, "TIC": "ROCK"}
