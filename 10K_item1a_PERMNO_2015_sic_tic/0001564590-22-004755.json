Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIndustry Environment and Operations Related\nWe are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is volatile and has caused, and may cause future, fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility. Demand for our products and services depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well completions, capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity. Drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period, particularly in the United States and Canada. The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including the:\n\u2022\ncurrent and anticipated future prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nvolatility of prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nability or willingness of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other countries, such as Russia, to maintain or influence price stability through voluntary production limits;\n\u2022\nsanctions and other restrictions placed on certain oil producing countries, such as Russia, Iran, and Venezuela;\n\u2022\nlevel of production by non-OPEC countries including production from U.S. shale plays;\n\u2022\nlevel of excess production capacity;\n\u2022\ncost of exploring for and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022\nlevel of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic activity and associated demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\npublic health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\navailability and access to potential hydrocarbon resources;\n\u2022\ngovernmental political requirements, regulation and energy policies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in political conditions in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of alternate energy sources; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations.\nExpectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, and other service companies, particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture. Oil and gas prices, which are determined by the marketplace, may remain below a range that is acceptable to certain of our customers, which could continue the reduced demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with certain contracts for our equipment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of capital equipment to be manufactured, assembled, tested and delivered by Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies in the amount of $1.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, could reduce our margins on these contracts, adversely impact completion of these contracts, adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties:\n\u2022\nfinancial challenges for consumers of our capital equipment;\n\u2022\ncredit market conditions for consumers of our capital equipment;\n\u2022\nour failure to adequately estimate costs for making this equipment;\n\u2022\nour inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nour inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes;\n\u2022\nunexpected increases in the costs of raw materials;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather, shipyard access, labor shortages or other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs or duties between countries, which could materially affect our global supply chain. For example, section 232 tariffs on steel may increase our costs, reduce margins or otherwise adversely affect the Company; and\n\u2022\nexport sanctions, controls or other trade restrictions, which could affect our ability to manufacture, sell, or receive payment for our equipment and/or services.\nThe Company\u2019s existing contracts for rig and production equipment generally carry significant down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and the majority do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. However, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition in our industry, including the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors, as well as the expiration of the intellectual property rights protecting our products and technologies, could ultimately lead to lower revenue and earnings.\nThe oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive. We compete with national, regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines. Certain of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us, and may be in a better competitive position. The following can each affect our revenue and earnings:\n\u2022\nprice changes;\n\u2022\nimprovements in the availability and delivery of products and services by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe expiration of intellectual property rights protecting our products and technologies.\nWe are a leader in the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the safety and productivity of drilling and well servicing processes. If we are unable to maintain our technology leadership position, it could adversely affect our competitive advantage for certain products and services. Our revenues and operating results have been dependent, in part, upon the successful introduction of new or improved products. Through our internal development programs and acquisitions, we have assembled an array of technologies protected by a substantial number of trade and service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, which expire after a prescribed duration, some at varying times in the near future. The expiration of these rights could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nFurthermore, while the Company stresses the importance of its research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new products are such that there can be no assurance that the Company will realize future revenue from new products.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, certain foreign jurisdictions and government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages. Actions taken by our competitors and changes in local policies, preferences or regulations could impact our ability to compete in certain markets and adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the 61 countries in which we operate.\nApproximately 68% of our revenues in 2021 were derived from operations outside the United States (based on revenue destination). Our foreign operations include significant operations in every oil producing region in the world. Our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\nuncertain political, social and economic environments;\n\u2022\nsocial unrest, acts of terrorism, war and other armed conflict;\n\u2022\npublic health crises and other catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ntrade and economic sanctions, export controls, and other restrictions imposed by the United States, European Union or other countries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar legislation, as well as foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nconfiscatory taxation, tax duties, complex and everchanging tax regimes or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022\nexposure to expropriation of our assets and other actions by foreign governments;\n\u2022\ndeprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;\n\u2022\ninflation; and\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company may be exposed to additional liabilities and risks. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the oil and gas industry over the last two years.\nIn 2020, oil demand significantly deteriorated because of the virus outbreak and corresponding governmental regulations implemented around the world to mitigate the spread of the virus. Physical markets became distressed as spot prices were negatively impacted by a lack of available storage capacity. The COVID-19 virus continued to spread during 2020, extending depressed demand, uncertainty and additional spending reductions by the entire oil and gas industry. During 2021, as COVID-19 curtailment efforts lessened in severity in certain geographies and the global\neconomy began to re-open, oil demand rebounded to approximately pre-pandemic levels. Driven by improved demand and reduced global supply, oil and gas prices have recovered to levels that incentivize re-investment.\nThe forced shutdown of economic activity directly affected our business and has exacerbated the potential negative impact from many of the risks described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, including those relating to our customers\u2019 capital spending and sharply reduced oil and natural gas prices. Demand for our products and services declined as our customers continued to revise their capital budgets downwards and swiftly adjusted their operations in response to lower commodity prices. Energy prices rebounded during 2021, but numerous COVID-19 related problems have persisted, especially as first the Delta and then the Omicron variants occurred in late 2021 and early 2022. The consequences of continued COVID-19 disruption included:\n\u2022\nInability to access raw materials and components;\n\u2022\nSuppliers putting the Company on allocations;\n\u2022\nHigher prices for raw materials and components;\n\u2022\nDelays and higher costs for shipping and transportation;\n\u2022\nOther supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022\nLabor shortages and absences;\n\u2022\nWage and other labor cost inflation;\n\u2022\nGovernment regulation; and\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions.\n\u2022\nincreased labor costs.\nA worsening of the virus or its variants could result in further mitigation efforts and a reduction in demand for oil and gas and our services and products.\nGiven the nature, scale, and scope of the above-described events we are not able to identify all potential risks to our business, however, we believe that the well-known impacts described above, and other potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nDisruption to our supply chain for materials essential to our business, including restrictions on importing and exporting products and inflationary pressure;\n\u2022\nCustomers may attempt to cancel or delay projects or may attempt to invoke force majeure clauses in certain contracts resulting in a decreased on delayed demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nCustomers may also seek to delay payments, may default on payment obligations and/or seek bankruptcy protection that could delay or prevent collections of certain accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nA credit rating downgrade of our corporate debt and potentially higher borrowing costs in the future;\n\u2022\nA need to preserve liquidity;\n\u2022\nReduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees as market conditions improve;\n\u2022\nLiabilities resulting from operational delays due to decreased productivity resulting from stay-at-home orders affecting its work force or facility closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nCyber security issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyber-attacks in the current environment of remote connectivity;\n\u2022\nLiabilities resulting from an inability to perform services due to limited manpower availability or an inability to travel to perform the services;\n\u2022\nOther contractual or other legal claims from our customers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with rationalization of our portfolio of real estate facilities, including possible exit of leases and facility closures to align with expected activity and workforce capacity;\n\u2022\nAdditional asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill, along with other accounting charges as demand for our services and products decreases;\n\u2022\nA structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel, and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression; and\n\u2022\nInfections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties.\nCybersecurity risks and threats could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of our information systems, or information systems owned by others that we use and rely on, could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger systems and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that any breach or interruption will be sufficiently limited. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of our intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may suffer business disruption from direct or indirect cyber-attacks. These take many forms, including ransomware directed at us, our vendors or our customers. For example, our operations were affected by the well-publicized shutdown of the Kronos Company\u2019s cloud-based employee work time keeping system, to which certain of our operations subscribe for recording hours worked. Our Human Resources and Operations management were able to quickly implement alternate procedures until the Kronos system was restored. We suffered no material loss due to the outage, and our employee data was not compromised. As with virtually all other large companies, we receive numerous phishing efforts, and other attempted cyber-attacks such as efforts to hack our systems or use distributed denial-of-service attacks. These cyber-security risks have not resulted in any material adverse interruption in our business to date but pose an ongoing threat of material interruption to our business activities.\nOur ability to hire and retain qualified personnel at competitive cost could materially affect our operations and growth potential.\nMany of the products we sell, and related services that we provide, are complex and technologically advanced, which enable them to perform in challenging conditions. Our ability to succeed is, in part, dependent on our success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to provide service and to design, manufacture, use, install and commission our products. A significant increase in wages paid by competitors, both within and outside the energy industry, for such highly skilled personnel could result in insufficient availability of skilled labor or increase our labor costs, or both. If the supply of skilled labor is constrained or our costs increase, our margins could decrease, and our growth potential could be impaired.\nSevere or unseasonable weather conditions may adversely affect our operations.\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Many experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services; inability to deliver material to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; decreases in demand for oil and natural gas during unseasonably warm winters; and loss of productivity. In addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nThe Company has approximately $1.5 billion of goodwill and $0.5 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2021. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate they might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant sustained reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant sustained reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a significant sustained reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas. The timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge, which could be material, would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgement. If we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was\nimpaired, we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity; resulting in a possible increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.\nSee additional discussion on \u201cGoodwill and Other Indefinite - Lived Intangible Assets\u201d in Critical Accounting Estimates of Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe have expanded and grown our businesses through acquisitions and continue to pursue a growth strategy but we cannot assure that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all.\nWe cannot assure that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to effectively manage any new lines of business. Any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased interest expense, increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the Company, any of which could cause our business to suffer.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nVarious federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as actions in other countries, have been or could be undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in many U.S. states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that generally include protections for proprietary information. Legislation, regulations and/or policies have also been adopted at the state level that impose other types of requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations (such as limits on operations in the event of certain levels of seismic activity). Additional legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations. Four states (New York, Maryland, Washington, and Vermont) have banned the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Oregon has adopted a five-year moratorium and Colorado has enacted legislation providing local governments with regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing operations. Local jurisdictions in some states have adopted ordinances that restrict or in certain cases prohibit the use of hydraulic fracturing, although many of these ordinances have been challenged and some have been overturned. In addition, governmental authorities in various foreign countries where we have provided or may provide hydraulic fracturing services have imposed or are considering imposing various restrictions or conditions that may affect hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Related\nOur failure to comply with existing or future U.S. and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with various complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, various trade control regulations, and human rights and anti-slavery legislation is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to effectively supervise and train our employees to deter prohibited practices. These various laws and regulations can change frequently and significantly. We may become involved in a governmental investigation even if the Company has complied with these laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulation, we could be subject to investigations, sanctions, and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business. Supply chain\nrestrictions such as the U.K. Modern Slavery Act and other similar legislation could also materially affect our supply chain, cost of production, and ability to manufacture our products.\nWe are also required to comply with various complex U.S. and foreign tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties can change frequently and significantly, and it is reasonable to expect changes in the future. If we fail to comply with any of these tax laws, regulations or treaties, we could be subject to, among other things, civil and criminal prosecution, fines, penalties and confiscation of our assets, which could disrupt our ability to provide our products and services to our customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, in some instances, direct or indirect consumers of our products and services, entities providing financing for purchases of our products and services or members of the supply chain for our products and services may become involved in governmental investigations, internal investigations, political or other enforcement matters. In such circumstances, such investigations may adversely impact the ability of consumers of our products, entities providing financial support to such consumers or entities in the supply chain to timely perform their business plans or to timely perform under agreements with us. The Company could also become involved in investigations of consumers of our products at significant cost to the Company.\nFocus and attention by advocacy groups and regulatory agencies on climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States and the European Union has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors, customers, governance pundits and government officials have increased focus on sustainability, stakeholder governance and the energy transition. As a result, there has been increased promotion of alternative energy sources and increased negative attitudes or perceptions of fossil fuels. The combination of these factors may significantly reduce demand for production of oil and gas and for our products and services. Furthermore, we face increased reputational risk and demand for our stock could be negatively impacted based on societal perceptions of our industry sector and our response to sustainability issues.\nWe could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies governing environmental protection, zoning and other matters. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future. If existing regulatory requirements change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. We cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations. Governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nOur businesses expose us to potential environmental, product or personal injury liability.\nOur businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment or a product could fail to perform or cause personal injury, or individuals may assert claims due to exposure to chemicals, harmful substances, environmental conditions any of which could result in:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property; or\n\u2022\nenvironmental damage and suspension of operations.\nOur current and past activities, as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries, could result in our facing substantial environmental, regulatory, personnel injury, class action, mass tort and other litigation and liabilities. These could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations. These liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories:\n\u2022\nnegligence;\n\u2022\nstrict liability;\n\u2022\nproducts liability;\n\u2022\nbreach of contract with customers; or\n\u2022\nas a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business, which is normally the case.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental, product or personal injury liabilities.\nWhile we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limits. In addition, certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination or may exclude coverage for other reasons. We face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nwe may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;\n\u2022\nour insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or\n\u2022\nthe dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.\nEven a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation, restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases, or other environmental regulations could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. State, national, and international governments and agencies in areas in which we conduct business continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. The President of the United States has issued Executive Orders seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and to suspend, revise, or rescind prior agency actions that the administration identified as conflicting with its climate policies. These include Executive Orders requiring a review of current U.S. federal lands leasing and permitting practices, as well as a temporary halt of new leasing of U.S. federal lands and offshore waters available for oil and gas exploration. The Executive Orders halting the leasing of U.S. federal lands were challenged in court and remain subject to litigation. As a result of the review of leasing and permitting practices, the U.S. Department of the Interior has recommended increasing the royalty rate payable to the U.S. government by operators, as well as bonding requirements and emissions requirements for operators. Some form of these recommendations may become applicable to operations on U.S. federal leases, which could have a negative effect on exploration and production of oil and natural gas given the increased costs associated with any such changes. In February 2021, the United States formally re-joined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gases emission reduction goals, every five years. Though we are closely following developments in this area and changes in the regulatory landscape in the United States, we cannot predict how or when those challenges may ultimately impact our business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide. The efforts we have taken, and may undertake in the future, to respond to these evolving or new regulations and to environmental initiatives of customers, investors, and others may increase our costs. These and other environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nLocal content requirements imposed in certain jurisdictions may increase the complexity of our operations and impact the demand for our services.\nA growing number of nations are requiring equipment providers and contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards. To meet many of these local content and other requirements, we are required to attract and retain qualified local personnel. If we are unable to do so because the supply of qualified local personnel is constrained for any reason, the growth and profitability of our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to work in certain jurisdictions is sometimes subject to our ability to successfully negotiate and agree upon acceptable joint venture agreements. The failure to reach acceptable agreements could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations in certain countries. Additionally, we may share control of joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties. Differences in views, and disagreements, among joint venture parties may result in delayed decision making and disputes on important issues. In some instances, we could suffer a material adverse effect to the results of our joint ventures and our consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation, tax audits, or exposure to additional tax liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions where we operate and our subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. In addition, our tax returns are subject to examination by the U.S. and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the examinations. An increase in tax rates, particularly in the U.S., changes in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our tax returns could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nGLOSSARY OF OILFIELD TERMS\n(Sources: Company management; \u201cA Dictionary for the Petroleum Industry,\u201d The University of Texas at Austin, 2001.)\nAPI\nAbbr: American Petroleum Institute\nAnnular Blowout Preventer\nA large valve, usually installed above the ram blowout preventers, that forms a seal in the annular space between the pipe and the wellbore or, if no pipe is present, in the wellbore itself.\nAnnulus\nThe open space around pipe in a wellbore through which fluids may pass.\nAutomatic Pipe Handling\nSystems (Automatic Pipe\nRacker)\nA device used on a drilling rig to automatically remove and insert drill stem components from and into the hole. It replaces the need for a person to be in the derrick or mast when tripping pipe into or out of the hole.\nAutomatic Roughneck\nA large, self-contained pipe-handling machine used by drilling crew members to make up and break out tubulars. The device combines a spinning wrench, torque wrench, and backup wrenches.\nBeam pump\nSurface pump that raise and lowers sucker rods continually, so as to operate a downhole pump.\nBit\nThe cutting or boring element used in drilling oil and gas wells. The bit consists of a cutting element and a circulating element. The cutting element is steel teeth, tungsten carbide buttons, industrial diamonds, or polycrystalline diamonds (\u201cPDCs\u201d). These teeth, buttons, or diamonds penetrate and gouge or scrape the formation to remove it. The circulating element permits the passage of drilling fluid and utilizes the hydraulic force of the fluid stream to improve drilling rates. In rotary drilling, several drill collars are joined to the bottom end of the drill pipe column, and the bit is attached to the end of the drill collars. Drill collars provide weight on the bit to keep it in firm contact with the bottom of the hole.\nBlowout\nAn uncontrolled flow of gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere. A blowout, or gusher, occurs when formation pressure exceeds the pressure applied to it by the column of drilling fluid. A kick warns of an impending blowout.\nBlowout Preventer (BOP)\nSeries of valves installed at the wellhead while drilling to prevent the escape of pressurized fluids.\nBlowout Preventer (BOP) Stack\nThe assembly of well-control equipment including preventers, spools, valves, and nipples connected to the top of the wellhead.\nBorehole Enlargement (\u201cBHE\u201d)\nThe process of opening up or enlarging the internal diameter of the wellbore. This is typically done with under-reamers, reamers, or hole openers.\nBottomhole Assembly (\u201cBHA\u201d)\nThe lower portion of the drillstring including (if used): the bit, bit sub, mud motor, stabilizers, drillcollar, heavy-weight drillpipe, jarring devices, and crossovers for various thread forms.\nCarbon-Neutral\nThe state of achieving net zero carbon dioxide emissions with removal or simply eliminating carbon dioxide emissions altogether.\nClosed Loop Drilling Systems\nA solids control system in which the drilling mud is reconditioned and recycled through the drilling process on the rig itself.\nCoiled Tubing\nA continuous string of flexible steel tubing, often hundreds or thousands of feet long, that is wound onto a reel, often dozens of feet in diameter. The reel is an integral part of the coiled tubing unit, which consists of several devices that ensure the tubing can be safely and efficiently inserted into the well from the surface. Because tubing can be lowered into a well without having to make up joints of tubing, running coiled tubing into the well is faster and less expensive than running conventional tubing. Rapid advances in the use of coiled tubing make it a popular way in which to run tubing into and out of a well. Also called reeled tubing.\nCuttings\nFragments of rock dislodged by the bit and brought to the surface in the drilling mud. Washed and dried cutting samples are analyzed by geologist to obtain information about the formations drilled.\nDirectional Well\nWell drilled in an orientation other than vertical in order to access broader portions of the formation.\nDrawworks\nThe hoisting mechanism on a drilling rig. It is essentially a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line and thus raises or lowers the drill stem and bit.\nDrill Pipe Elevator (Elevator)\nOn conventional rotary rigs and top-drive rigs, hinged steel devices with manual operating handles that crew members latch onto a tool joint (or a sub). Since the elevators are directly connected to the traveling block, or to the integrated traveling block in the top drive, when the driller raises or lowers the block or the top-drive unit, the drill pipe is also raised or lowered.\nDrilling jars\nA percussion tool operated manually or hydraulically to deliver a heavy downward blow to free a stuck drill stem.\nDrilling mud\nA specially compounded liquid circulated through the wellbore during rotary drilling operations.\nDrilling riser\nA conduit used in offshore drilling through which the drill bit and other tools are passed from the rig on the water\u2019s surface to the sea floor.\nDrill stem\nAll members in the assembly used for rotary drilling from the swivel to the bit, including the Kelly, the drill pipe and tool joints, the drill collars, the stabilizers, and various specialty items.\nFiberglass-reinforced spoolable pipe\nA spoolable glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite tubular product for onshore oil and gas gathering and injection systems, with superior corrosion resistant properties and lower installed cost than steel.\nFlexible pipe\nA dynamic riser that connects subsea production equipment to a topside facility allowing for the flow of oil, gas, and/or water. Also used on the seafloor to tie wells and subsea equipment together.\nFormation\nA bed or deposit composed throughout of substantially the same kind of rock; often a lithologic unit. Each formation is given a name, frequently as a result of the study of the formation outcrop at the surface and sometimes based on fossils found in the formation.\nFPSO\nA Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel used to receive hydrocarbons from subsea wells, and then produce and store the hydrocarbons until they can be offloaded to a tanker or pipeline.\nHardbanding\nA special wear-resistant material often applied to tool joints to prevent abrasive wear to the area when the pipe is being rotated downhole.\nHub Height\nThe distance from the turbine platform to the rotor of an installed wind turbine and indicates how high the turbine stands above the ground (or water), not including the length of the wind blades.\nHydraulic Fracturing\nThe process of creating fractures in a formation by pumping fluids, at high pressures, into the reservoir, which allows or enhances the flow of hydrocarbons.\nIron Roughneck\nA floor-mounted combination of a spinning wrench and a torque wrench. The Iron Roughneck moves into position hydraulically and eliminates the manual handling involved with suspended individual tools.\nJack-up rig\nA mobile bottom-supported offshore drilling structure with columnar or open-truss legs that support the deck and hull. When positioned over the drilling site, the bottoms of the legs penetrate the seafloor.\nJar\nA mechanical device placed near the top of the drill stem which allows the driller to strike a very heavy blow upward or downward on stuck pipe.\nJoint\n1. In drilling, a single length (from 16 feet to 45 feet, or 5 meters to 14.5 meters, depending on its range length) of drill pipe, drill collar, casing or tubing that has threaded connections at both ends. Several joints screwed together constitute a stand of pipe. 2. In pipelining, a single length (usually 40 feet-12 meters) of pipe. 3. In sucker rod pumping, a single length of sucker rod that has threaded connections at both ends.\nKelly\nThe heavy steel tubular device, four-or six-sided, suspended from the swivel through the rotary table and connected to the top joint of drill pipe to turn the drill stem as the rotary table turns. It has a bored passageway that permits fluid to be circulated into the drill stem and up the annulus, or vice versa. Kellys manufactured to API specifications are available only in four-or six-sided versions, are either 40 or 54 feet (12 or 16 meters) long, and have diameters as small as 2.5 inches (6 centimeters) and as large as 6 inches (15 centimeters).\nKelly bushing\nA special device placed around the kelly that mates with the kelly flats and fits into the master bushing of the rotary table. The kelly bushing is designed so that the kelly is free to move up or down through it. The bottom of the bushing may be shaped to fit the opening in the master bushing or it may have pins that fit into the master bushing. In either case, when the kelly bushing is inserted into the master bushing and the master bushing is turned, the kelly bushing also turns. Since the kelly bushing fits onto the kelly, the kelly turns, and since the kelly is made up to the drill stem, the drill stem turns. Also called the drive bushing.\nKelly spinner\nA pneumatically operated device mounted on top of the kelly that, when actuated, causes the kelly to turn or spin. It is useful when the kelly or a joint of pipe attached to it must be spun up, that is, rotated rapidly for being made up.\nKick\nAn entry of water, gas, oil, or other formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. If prompt action is not taken to control the kick, or kill the well, a blowout may occur.\nLevelized Cost of Energy\n(\u201cLCOE\u201d)\nA measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generating plant over its lifetime. The LCOE is calculated as the ratio between all the discounted costs over the lifetime on an electricity generating plant divided by a discounted sum of the actual energy amounts delivered. LCOE is used to compare different methods of electricity generation on a consistent basis.\nMaking-up\n1. To assemble and join parts to form a complete unit (e.g., to make up a string of drill pipe). 2. To screw together two threaded pieces. 3. To mix or prepare (e.g., to make up a tank of mud). 4. To compensate for (e.g., to make up for lost time).\nManual tongs (Tongs)\nThe large wrenches used for turning when making up or breaking out drill pipe, casing, tubing, or other pipe; variously called casing tongs, pipe tongs, and so forth, according to the specific use. Power tongs or power wrenches are pneumatically or hydraulically operated tools that serve to spin the pipe up tight and, in some instances to apply the final makeup torque.\nMaster bushing\nA device that fits into the rotary table to accommodate the slips and drive the kelly bushing so that the rotating motion of the rotary table can be transmitted to the kelly. Also called rotary bushing.\nMooring system\nThe method by which a vessel or buoy is fixed to a certain position, whether permanently or temporarily.\nMotion compensation\nequipment\nAny device (such as a bumper sub or heave compensator) that serves to maintain constant weight on the bit in spite of vertical motion of a floating offshore drilling rig.\nMud pump\nA large, high-pressure reciprocating pump used to circulate the mud on a drilling rig.\nNacelle\nA cover housing that houses all of the generating components in a wind turbine, including the generator, gearbox, drive train, and brake assembly. The nacelle must be easily accessible for maintenance and repair work.\nPlug gauging\nThe mechanical process of ensuring that the inside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards.\nPressure control equipment\nEquipment used in: 1. The act of preventing the entry of formation fluids into a wellbore. 2. The act of controlling high pressures encountered in a well.\nPressure pumping\nPumping fluids into a well by applying pressure at the surface.\nRam blowout preventer\nA blowout preventer that uses rams to seal off pressure on a hole that is with or without pipe. Also called a ram preventer.\nRing gauging\nThe mechanical process of ensuring that the outside threads on a piece of drill pipe comply with API standards.\nRiser pipe\nThe pipe and special fitting used on floating offshore drilling rigs to establish a seal between the top of the wellbore, which is on the ocean floor, and the drilling equipment located above the surface of the water. A riser pipe serves as a guide for the drill stem from the drilling vessel to the wellhead and as a conductor for drilling fluid from the well to the vessel. The riser consists of several sections of pipe and includes special devices to compensate for any movement of the drilling rig caused by waves. Also called marine riser pipe, riser joint.\nRotary table\nThe principal piece of equipment in the rotary table assembly; a turning device used to impart rotational power to the drill stem while permitting vertical movement of the pipe for rotary drilling. The master bushing fits inside the opening of the rotary table; it turns the kelly bushing, which permits vertical movement of the kelly while the stem is turning.\nRotating blowout\npreventer (Rotating Head)\nA sealing device used to close off the annular space around the kelly in drilling with pressure at the surface, usually installed above the main blowout preventers. A rotating head makes it possible to drill ahead even when there is pressure in the annulus that the weight of the drilling fluid is not overcoming; the head prevents the well from blowing out. It is used mainly in the drilling of formations that have low permeability. The rate of penetration through such formations is usually rapid.\nSafety clamps\nA clamp placed very tightly around a drill collar that is suspended in the rotary table by drill collar slips. Should the slips fail, the clamp is too large to go through the opening in the rotary table and therefore prevents the drill collar string from falling into the hole. Also called drill collar clamp.\nShale shaker\nA piece of drilling rig equipment that uses a vibrating screen to remove cuttings from the circulating fluid in rotary drilling operations. The size of the openings in the screen should be selected carefully to be the smallest size possible to allow 100 per cent flow of the fluid. Also called a shaker.\nSlim-hole completions\n(Slim-hole Drilling)\nDrilling in which the size of the hole is smaller than the conventional hole diameter for a given depth. This decrease in hole size enables the operator to run smaller casing, thereby lessening the cost of completion.\nSlips\nWedge-shaped pieces of metal with serrated inserts (dies) or other gripping elements, such as serrated buttons, that suspend the drill pipe or drill collars in the master bushing of the rotary table when it is necessary to disconnect the drill stem from the kelly or from the top-drive unit\u2019s drive shaft. Rotary slips fit around the drill pipe and wedge against the master bushing to support the pipe. Drill collar slips fit around a drill collar and wedge against the master bushing to support the drill collar. Power slips are pneumatically or hydraulically actuated devices that allow the crew to dispense with the manual handling of slips when making a connection.\nSolids\nSee \u201cCuttings\u201d\nSpinning wrench\nAir-powered or hydraulically powered wrench used to spin drill pipe in making or breaking connections.\nSpinning-in\nThe rapid turning of the drill stem when one length of pipe is being joined to another. \u201cSpinning-out\u201d refers to separating the pipe.\nStand\nThe connected joints of pipe racked in the derrick or mast when making a trip. On a rig, the usual stand is about 90 feet (about 27 meters) long (three lengths of drill pipe screwed together), or a treble.\nSteerable Technologies\nTools that allow for steering the BHA towards a target while rotating from surface.\nString\nThe entire length of casing, tubing, sucker rods, or drill pipe run into a hole.\nSucker rod\nA special steel pumping rod. Several rods screwed together make up the link between the pumping unit on the surface and the pump at the bottom of the well.\nTensioner\nA system of devices installed on a floating offshore drilling rig to maintain a constant tension on the riser pipe, despite any vertical motion made by the rig. The guidelines must also be tensioned, so a separate tensioner system is provided for them.\nThermal desorption\nThe process of removing drilling mud from cuttings by applying heat directly to drill cuttings.\nTiebacks (Subsea)\nA series of flowlines and pipes that connect numerous subsea wellheads to a single collection point.\nTop drive\nA device similar to a power swivel that is used in place of the rotary table to turn the drill stem. It also includes power tongs. Modern top drives combine the elevator, the tongs, the swivel, and the hook. Even though the rotary table assembly is not used to rotate the drill stem and bit, the top-drive system retains it to provide a place to set the slips to suspend the drill stem when drilling stops.\nTorque wrench\nSpinning wrench with a gauge for measuring the amount of torque being applied to the connection.\nTrouble cost\nCosts incurred as a result of unanticipated complications while drilling a well. These costs are often referred to as contingency costs during the planning phase of a well.\nTurret\nMechanical device that allows a floating vessel to rotate around stationary flowlines, umbilicals, and other associated risers.\nWell completion\n1. The activities and methods of preparing a well for the production of oil and gas or for other purposes, such as injection; the method by which one or more flow paths for hydrocarbons are established between the reservoir and the surface. 2. The system of tubulars, packers, and other tools installed beneath the wellhead in the production casing; that is, the tool assembly that provides the hydrocarbon flow path or paths.\nWellhead\nThe termination point of a wellbore at surface level or subsea, often incorporating various valves and control instruments.\nWell stimulation\nAny of several operations used to increase the production of a well, such as acidizing or fracturing.\nWell workover\nThe performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to increase production. Examples of workover jobs are deepening, plugging back, pulling and resetting liners, and squeeze cementing.\nWellbore\nA borehole; the hole drilled by the bit. A wellbore may have casing in it or it may be open (uncased); or part of it may be cased, and part of it may be open. Also called a borehole or hole.\nWireline\nA slender, rodlike or threadlike piece of metal usually small in diameter, that is used for lowering special tools (such as logging sondes, perforating guns, and so forth) into the well. Also called slick line.\nOverview of Oil and Gas Well-Construction Processes\nThe well-construction process starts with an oil and gas operator and its contractors designating a suitable drilling site and placing a drilling rig at the location. The rig\u2019s crew assembles the drill stem, which consists of drillpipe joints, specialized drilling components known as downhole tools, and a drill bit at the end. Modern rigs typically power the drill bit through a drilling motor, which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides rotational force directly to the bit, or a top drive, a device suspended from the derrick that turns the entire drill stem. The evolution of drilling motors and top drives has facilitated operators\u2019 abilities to drill directionally and horizontally as opposed to being limited to the traditional vertical trajectory. The Company sells and rents drilling motors, agitators, drill bits, downhole tools and drill pipe through Wellbore Technologies, and sells top drives through Rig Technologies.\nHeavy drilling fluids, or \u201cdrilling muds,\u201d are pumped down the drill stem and forced out through jets in the bit. The drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem, carrying with it the rock cuttings drilled out by the bit. The cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids control system (which can include shakers, centrifuges, and other specialized equipment) and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The solids control system permits the mud, which is often comprised of expensive compounds, to be continuously reused and re-circulated back into the hole. Rig Technologies sells the large \u201cmud pumps\u201d that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem, down, and back up the hole. Wellbore Technologies sells and rents solids control equipment and provides solids control, waste management and drilling fluids services.\nMany operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from the corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling; have hard-facing alloys applied to drillpipe joints, collars, and other components to protect tool joints and casing against wear; and inspect and assess the integrity of the drillpipe from time to time. Wellbore Technologies manufactures and sells drillpipe and provides coating, \u201chardfacing,\u201d and drillpipe inspection and repair. As hole depth increases, additional joints of drillpipe are continuously added to the drill stem. When the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem - including the drilling motors - otherwise requires servicing, the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drillpipe. These are set aside or \u201cracked,\u201d the old bit is replaced or service is performed, and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole (a process called \u201ctripping\u201d). During drilling and tripping operations, joints of drillpipe must be screwed together and tightened (\u201cmade up\u201d), and loosened and unscrewed (\u201cspun out\u201d), a process that can create a considerable amount of stress on the pipe connections while also being quite time consuming. Rig Technologies provides drilling equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drillpipe in an efficient and safe manner, and Wellbore Technologies manufactures premium connections that are designed to reduce failure downhole and improve the rate of connection on the rig floor. When the hole has reached a specified depth, all the drillpipe is pulled out of the hole, and larger-diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented in place to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole. The casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole, another service provided by Wellbore Technologies. Hole openers from Wellbore Technologies, which mount above the drill bits in the drill stem, open the tolerance of the hole to allow for easier and faster casing installation. Completion & Production Solutions manufactures cement mixing and pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place. The rig\u2019s hoisting system raises and lowers the drill stem while drilling or tripping, and lowers casing into the wellbore. A conventional hoisting system is a block-and-tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rig\u2019s derrick. The mechanism is lifted by a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick. Rig Technologies sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting-systems.\nDuring the course of normal drilling operations, the drill stem passes through different geological formations that exhibit varying pressure characteristics. If this pressure is not contained, oil, gas, and/or water would flow out of these formations to the surface. Containing reservoir pressures is accomplished primarily by the circulation of heavy drilling muds and secondarily by blowout preventers (\u201cBOPs\u201d), should the mud prove inadequate. Drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that optimize the drilling process. In addition to containing formation pressure, they must provide power to the drilling motor; carry drilled solids to the surface; protect the drilled formations from being damaged; and cool the drill bit. Achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well, requires a high level of cleanliness for better bottomhole assembly, and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials, such as certain types of clay. The fluid itself is often oil or more expensive synthetic mud. Given the cost, it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible. Solids control equipment such as shale shakers, centrifuges, cuttings dryers, and mud cleaners help accomplish this objective. Wellbore Technologies provides drilling fluids and rents, sells, operates, and services solids control equipment. Rig Technologies manufactures pumps that power the flow of the mud and fluid downhole and back to the surface. Drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions. However, as the hole is drilled, the drill stem may encounter a high-pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure. Should efforts to \u201cweight up\u201d the mud to contain such a pressure kick fail, a blowout could result, whereby reservoir fluids would flow uncontrolled into the well. A series of BOPs are positioned at the top of the well and, when activated, form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids to the surface. Conventional BOPs prevent normal rig operations when closed so the BOPs are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure. Rig Technologies engineers and manufactures BOPs.\nThe operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors, which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rig\u2019s hook, the incidence of pressure kicks, the operation of the drilling mud pumps, weight on bit, etc. Wellbore Technologies sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions as well as additional sensors that continuously collect downhole data that can be transmitted back to the surface via wired drill pipe. Wellbore Technologies\u2019 also offers drilling optimization and automation software and services that utilize this downhole data to maximize drilling performance by mitigating vibrations, dynamic and impact loading, and stick-slip, which ensures longer bit runs, and reduces the number of necessary trips.\nDuring drilling operations, the drilling rig and related equipment and tools are subject to severe stresses, pressures, and temperatures, as well as a corrosive environment, and require regular repair and maintenance. Rig Technologies supplies spare parts and can dispatch field service engineers with the expertise to quickly repair and maintain equipment, minimizing down time.\nOnce a well has been drilled, cased, and cemented, and the operator determines hydrocarbons are present in commercial quantities, the well is then completed, and sometimes stimulated. After the casing is cemented in place, the well undergoes one of several completion processes to open the bottom of the wellbore and allow hydrocarbons to flow from the reservoir and up the well to the surface. The most commonly used technique is known as perforation. The perforating process entails lowering a string of shaped charges to the desired depth in the well using an electric wireline unit and firing the charges to perforate the casing or liner. Wireline units are also used to perform logging operations and other intervention services. At this point, the operator may decide, based on well design and flow rate, to further enhance production by stimulating the well. Unconventional wells almost always require stimulation through multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, a process by which a fluid or slurry is pumped down the well by large pumping units. This causes the underground formation to crack or fracture, opening up space for hydrocarbons to flow more freely out of tight rock formations. A proppant is suspended in the fluid and lodges in the cracks, propping them open and allowing hydrocarbons to flow after the fluid is gone. A coiled tubing unit is often used to drill out bridge plugs that isolate the many stages needed to stimulate a horizontal well. A coiled tubing unit utilizes a large continuous length of steel tubing to enter and traverse long laterals and perform completion and well remediation operations. As drilling laterals have lengthened in recent years, many operators are electing to use larger high-specification well service rigs to assist in several phases of the completion phase by conveying tools downhole and drilling out completion plugs. Workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated. Completion & Production Solutions provides the essential equipment necessary for the entirety of the completion and stimulation process, designing and manufacturing coiled tubing units, wireline units, pressure pumping equipment, completion tools, snubbing units, nitrogen units, and treating iron. In addition, the well completion process creates a large amount of wear and tear on the equipment used, which creates healthy demand for Completion & Production Solutions\u2019 aftermarket services. The use of coiled tubing and wireline equipment typically requires the use of a BOP to ensure safety during operations. Completion & Production Solutions manufactures this well control equipment. Due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids, production tubing is often inspected and coated, services offered by Wellbore Technologies. Increasingly, operators choose to use corrosion-resistant composite materials or alloys in the process, which are also sold by Completion & Production Solutions.\nOnce the well has been stimulated, it is usually ready to be capped with a production wellhead and linked up to a gathering system where it can begin producing and generating cash flow for the operator. This process is significantly more involved offshore, where pipes are often required to reach thousands of feet from the wellhead back to the surface, contending with tides, debris, and weather. The development of flexible pipe solved many of the issues associated with linking offshore wells back to their respective FPSOs, which serve as gathering hubs, sometimes in some of the most remote areas of the world. Completion & Production Solutions manufactures flexible subsea pipe in addition to offering turret mooring systems and topside process modules for FPSOs.\nNatural decline rates set in as a well ages, and workover procedures and other services may be necessary to extend its life and increase its production rate. Over time, downhole equipment, casing, or tubing may need to be serviced or replaced. When producing wells require anything from routine maintenance to major modifications and repair, a well servicing rig is typically needed. Workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead, tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate or remediate the well. As a well continues to mature, its natural reservoir pressure may no longer be enough to force fluids to the surface. Artificial lift equipment is then typically installed, which adds energy to the fluid column in a wellbore using one of several types of pumps. In addition to reduced pressure, the water cut of a well\u2019s production tends to increase as the well ages,\nwhich typically requires the addition of water treatment and separation equipment. The Company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through Rig Technologies. Tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well, a service Wellbore Technologies provides. Completion & Production Solutions offers several types of artificial lift and related support systems as well as integrated systems that provide water treatment, separation, hydrate inhibition, and gas processing.", "PERMNO": 84032, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "NOV"}
