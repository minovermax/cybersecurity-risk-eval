{"cik": "1103021", "company": "BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as all other information contained in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and as such, you cannot rely upon our historical operating performance to make an investment decision regarding our company.\nFrom our inception in January 1997 and through December 31, 2019, we recorded significant losses. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net income of $25.7 million. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was approximately $340.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $129.4 million. Our ability\nto generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to effectively market and sell our products, secure and maintain payer access and manufacture our products to meet demand. We may be unable to achieve any or all of these goals consistently and there is no guarantee that we will continue to generate revenue in the future.\nWe have generated licensing-related revenue for ONSOLIS outside the US, and we have generated revenue from the commercial sales of our approved products, BELBUCA, in addition to generating revenue from the commercial sales of Symproic. In the case of BELBUCA, our approval initially generated milestone revenue from our prior commercial partner Endo. However, in January 2017, we re-acquired the commercialization rights for BELBUCA and are utilizing our internal sales force to sell our product. In the case of Symproic, we acquired rights to the product in April 2019, and commenced the commercial launch of the product using our own sales force shortly thereafter. We have also historically generated revenue from the commercial sale of BUNAVAIL however, in June 2020, we subsequently discontinued marketing for BUNAVAIL and do not expect to generate revenue from sales of BUNAVAIL in the future. In the case of ONSOLIS, as of the date of this report, we do not have any plans to launch ONSOLIS in the U.S.\nIf our competitors are successful in obtaining approval for Abbreviated New Drug Applications for products that have the same active ingredients as BELBUCA or Symproic, sales of BELBUCA or Symproic may be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may submit for approval certain Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, which provide for the marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as a drug product already listed with the FDA, and which has been shown to be bioequivalent to such FDA-listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic versions of a listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for an original listed drug. Any applicant filing an ANDA is required to make patent certifications to the FDA, such as certification to the FDA that the new product that is subject to the ANDA will not infringe an already approved product\u2019s listed patents or that such patents are invalid (otherwise known as a Paragraph IV Certification).\nIn the past, we have initiated litigation with generic competitors that have filed Paragraph IV Certifications challenging certain of our patents. While we have entered in to settlement agreements with certain competitors, we are still pursuing litigation to defend against Patent IV Certifications related to BELBUCA. For more information, see Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV of this Report on Form 10-K. We believe that we will continue to be subject to ANDA-related litigation, which is costly and distracting and has the potential to impair the long-term value of our products.\nWe may need to raise additional funding to fund certain strategic initiatives. Depending on the nature of those initiatives, if we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to pursue certain initiatives..\nWe expect to spend substantial amounts of our financial resources on our commercialization efforts going forward. Our business currently generates revenue from product sales, and such current sources of revenue may not be sufficient to meet potential capital requirements to support such strategic priorities. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are unavailable, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more potential strategic opportunities.\nOur long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks.\nOur long-term capital requirements are expected to depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products\n\u2022costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing (through litigation or other means) our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property;\n\u2022costs involved in expanding manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our products;\n\u2022costs we may incur in acquiring new technologies or products;\n\u2022competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants; and\n\u2022legal, accounting, insurance and other professional and business-related costs.\nWe may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources, which may have a material effect on our current or future business prospects.\nOur term loan agreement with Pharmakon contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We may be required to make a prepayment or repay the outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect under our loan agreement if a prepayment event or an event of default occurs, including a material adverse change with respect to us, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOur agreement with Pharmakon contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into a merger, consolidation or certain changing of control events without complying with the terms of the loan agreement;\n\u2022change the nature of our business;\n\u2022change our organizational structure or type;\n\u2022amend, modify or waive any of our material agreements or organizational documents;\n\u2022grant certain types of liens on our assets;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022pay cash dividends; and\n\u2022enter into material transactions with affiliates.\nThe restrictive covenants of the term loan agreement could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the term loan agreement. An event of default will also occur if, among other things, a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition occurs, or a material impairment of the prospect of our repayment of any portion of the amounts we owe under the term loan agreement occurs. In the case of a continuing event of default under the agreement, Pharmakon could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, proceed against the collateral in which we granted Pharmakon a security interest under the term loan agreement and related agreements, or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the term loan agreement are secured by all of our existing and future assets (excluding certain intellectual property).\nWe may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds on satisfactory terms, if at all, through equity or debt financings to make any required prepayment or repay such indebtedness at the time any such prepayment event or event of default occurs. In such an event, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to market our products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result.\nSocial issues around the abuse of opioids, including law enforcement and other legal concerns over diversion of opioids and regulatory efforts to combat abuse, misuse and addiction, could impact the potential market for BELBUCA.\nOpioid abuse in the U.S. is a significant healthcare issue, and the active ingredient in BELBUCA is an opioid. Media reports regarding prescription drug abuse and the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies have and will likely continue to apply policies and guidelines that seek to limit the availability or use of opioids. In addition, federal, state and local governments have and may enact legislation or executive orders with similar goals. State and local governments have also taken legal action against opioid manufacturers to recoup alleged damages arising out of the abuse and misuse of opioids. Such efforts have challenged and could inhibit our ability to successfully market BELBUCA.\nAggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of oxycodone or other opioid drugs; the limitations of abuse-resistant formulations; the ability of drug abusers to discover previously unknown ways to abuse opioid drugs; public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse; litigation; or regulatory activity regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioid drugs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, there may be continued reluctance of some regulators and third-party payers to pay a premium for abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids or opioids such as BELBUCA with less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids. These factors could reduce the potential size of the market for BELBUCA and decrease the revenues we are able to generate from its sale.\nEfforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat abuse of opioids may negatively impact the market for BELBUCA. For example, in February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA\u2019s approach to opioid medications. The plan identifies FDA\u2019s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA\u2019s plan include strengthening\npost marketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic-abuse deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA\u2019s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The FDA\u2019s Scientific Advisory Board met to address these issues on March 1, 2016. The FDA\u2019s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the HHS to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative\u2019s focus is on improving physician\u2019s use of opioids through education and resources to address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling and behavioral therapies with medication to address substance abuse. Also, as part of this initiative, the CDC has launched a state grant program to offer state health departments resources to assist with abuse prevention efforts, including efforts to track opioid prescribing through state-run electronic databases. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. The guideline does not specifically address the use of buprenorphine for chronic pain or make treatment recommendations about the use of abuse-deterrent opioids.\nIn June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This was the first time the agency took steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDA\u2019s decision was based on a review of all available post-marketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product\u2019s reformulation.\nIn September 2017, the CDC removed the MME conversion factors for buprenorphine from its online oral MME data file. And, in 2018, it included a statement in the MME data file noting \u201cBuprenorphine doses are not expected to be associated with overdose risk in the same dose-dependent manner as doses for full agonist opioids.\u201d\nIn May 2019, the Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force issued their Final Report on Pain Management Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, Inconsistencies, and Recommendations. The report identified that one of the barriers in pain management best practices \u201cincludes lack of coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine as well as the lack of education and training on the proper usage of buprenorphine. There has been a lack of access to buprenorphine treatment for chronic pain.\u201d The report then makes recommendations that third-party payers should provide coverage and reimbursement for buprenorphine treatment approaches. The report also encouraged the primary use of buprenorphine when opioids are appropriate for chronic pain. In October 2019, the HHS issued a guide for clinicians on how to appropriately reduce the dose for patients on long-term opioids. Within this guidance, it was noted that if patients on high opioid dosages are unable to taper despite worsening pain and/or function with opioids, clinicians should consider transitioning the patient to buprenorphine. The guide also noted that in addition to treating pain, buprenorphine has other properties that may be helpful, including less opioid-induced hyperalgesia and easier withdrawal than full mu-agonist opioids, and less respiratory depression than other long-acting opioids.\nIn addition, at least 49 U.S. states and many cities and counties have filed civil suits or instituted other proceedings against opioid manufacturers and wholesalers of opioid drugs seeking damages under various claims for contributing to the opioid crisis. Such litigations could further damage the market for opioid products like BELBUCA. To the extent our company is named in such lawsuits, we could be required to participate in the settlement of such litigations or the payment of damages, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business, deplete our financial resources, and damage our reputation.\nGovernment agencies may establish and promulgate usage guidelines that could limit the use of our products and drug candidates.\nNational and state level government agencies, professional and medical societies, and other groups may establish usage guidelines that apply to our products and drug candidates. These guidelines could address such matters as usage and dose, among other factors. Application of such guidelines could limit the clinical use or commercial appeal of our products or drug candidates.\nAs such, in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted a soft edit of 90 MME per day for patients, aligning with the 2016 CDC Guideline recommendation. A medication soft edit can be used to alert the pharmacist to a potential safety risk for the patient, but can often be overridden after consulting with the prescriber.\nIf we are unable to convince physicians as to the benefits of our products, we may incur delays or additional expense in our attempt to establish market acceptance.\nUse of our products will require physicians to be informed regarding the intended benefits of our products. The time and cost of such an educational process may be substantial. Inability to carry out this physician education process may adversely affect market acceptance of our proposed formulations or products. We may be unable to timely educate physicians regarding our intended pharmaceutical formulations or products in sufficient numbers to achieve our marketing plans or to achieve product acceptance. Any delay in physician education may materially delay or reduce demand for our formulations or products. Nonetheless, even with our best efforts, certain physicians may never prescribe our product.\nWe have been and expect to be significantly dependent on our collaboration agreements for the manufacturing of our products, which expose us to the risk of reliance on the performance of third parties.\nIn conducting our operations, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on numerous collaborative agreements with third parties such as manufacturers, commercial partners, governmental agencies and not-for-profit organizations for both strategic and financial resources.\nThe termination of these relationships, or failure to perform by us or our partners (who are subject to regulatory, competitive and other risks) under their applicable agreements or arrangements with us, or our failure to secure additional agreements for our products, would substantially disrupt or delay our development activities. Any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time.\nOur ability to achieve our corporate objectives will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management, particularly our senior executive officers. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to loss of sales and diversion of management resources. In addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our commercialization programs. Additionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals.\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur business strategy involves growth and expansion as we continue our evolution as a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company. As we in-license or acquire additional product candidates, we will likely have to expand existing operations to increase our contract manufacturing capabilities, hire and train new personnel to handle the marketing and sales of our products and assist patients in obtaining reimbursement for the use of our products. We may also need to grow to support our commercial activities for BELBUCA and Symproic. This growth may place significant strain on our management, financial and operational resources. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls, systems and procedures. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our success in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, for which the competition may be intense. If we fail to manage these challenges effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe are exposed to product liability and, non-clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. It is possible that such claims could be asserted against us at some point. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have a general liability/product liability policy which includes coverage for our commercially marketed products. Annual aggregate limits include $2 million for general liability, with $1 million for each occurrence, with umbrella liability in the amount of an additional $5 million aggregate and $5 million per occurrence; product liability is $10 million for aggregate and $10 million per occurrence. It is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims. Under our agreements, our partners are required to carry comprehensive general product liability and tort liability insurance, each in amounts not less than $2 million per incident and $2 million annual aggregate and to name us as an additional insured thereon. However, we or our commercial partners may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential liabilities. Furthermore, our current and potential partners with whom we have collaborative agreements, or our future licensees may not be willing to indemnify us against these types of liabilities and may not themselves be sufficiently insured or have sufficient assets to satisfy any product liability claims. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage\nthat may be obtained by us or our partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, product liability insurance is costly, and due to the nature of the pharmaceutical products underlying BELBUCA, Symproic, and ONSOLIS, we or our partners may not be able to obtain such insurance, or, if obtained, we or our partners may not be able to maintain such insurance on economically feasible terms. If a product related action is brought against us, or liability is found against us prior to our obtaining product liability insurance for any product, or should we have liability found against us for any other matter in excess of any insurance coverage we may carry, we could face significant difficulty continuing operations.\nWe are presently a party to lawsuits by third parties who claim that our products, methods of manufacture or methods of use infringe on their intellectual property rights, and we may be exposed to these types of claims in the future.\nWe are presently, and may continue to be, exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our technologies, processes, formulations, methods, or products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in pharmaceutical patents is, in most instances, uncertain and highly complex. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, would result in substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial and human resources and could harm our reputation. Such a situation may force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022incur significant costs in legal expenses for defending against an intellectual property infringement suit;\n\u2022cease selling, making, importing, incorporating or using one or more or all of our technologies and/or formulations or products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;\n\u2022obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or\n\u2022redesign our formulations or products, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nWith respect to our BEMA delivery technology, the thin film drug delivery technology space is highly competitive. There is a risk that a court of law in the U.S. or elsewhere could determine that one or more of our BEMA based products conflicts with or covered by external patents. This risk presently exists in our litigation with Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as MonoSol Rx LLC, or Aquestive) relating to our BELBUCA product which was filed in January 2017. If the courts in these cases were to rule against us and our partner in these cases, we could be forced to license technology from Aquestive or be prevented from marketing BELBUCA, or otherwise incur liability for damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability for us or our partners to market and sell BELBUCA.\nWe have been granted non-exclusive license rights to European Patent No. 949 925, which is controlled by LTS to market BELBUCA and ONSOLIS within the countries of the European Union. We are required to pay a low single digit royalty on sales of products that are covered by this patent in the European Union. We have not conducted freedom to operate searches and analyses for our other proposed products. Moreover, the possibility exists that a patent could issue that would cover one or more of our products, requiring us to defend a patent infringement suit or necessitating a patent validity challenge that would be costly, time consuming and possibly unsuccessful.\nOur lawsuits with Aquestive and Indivior have caused us to incur significant legal costs to defend ourselves, and we would be subject to similar costs if we are a party to similar lawsuits in the future Furthermore, if a court were to determine that we infringe any other patents and that such patents are valid, we might be required to seek one or more licenses to commercialize our BEMA products. We may be unable to obtain such licenses from the patent holders, which could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or secure rights to third-party patents, we may lose valuable rights, experience reduced market share, assuming there is any market share, or incur costly litigation to, enforce, maintain or protect such rights.\nOur ability to license, enforce and maintain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others will be important to our commercializing any formulations or products under development. The current and future development of our drug delivery technologies is contingent upon whether we are able to maintain licenses and access patented technologies. Without these licenses, the use of technologies would be limited and the sales of our products could be prohibited. Therefore, any disruption in access to the technologies could substantially delay the development and sale of our products.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including ours, which involve licensing agreements, are frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a\npatent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and licensed rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop drug delivery technologies or products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements provide that materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and assign the ownership of relevant inventions created during the course of employment to us. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets, technical know-how and other non-patented technology.\nIn addition, we may have to resort to costly and time consuming litigation to protect or enforce our rights under certain intellectual property, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending our rights could be expensive, could cause significant diversion of our resources and may not prove successful. Any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technologies to develop or sell competing products.\nWe are dependent on third party suppliers for key components of our delivery technologies and products.\nWe rely on certain materials used in our development and third-party manufacturing processes, most of which are procured from five contract manufacturers and three active pharmaceutical ingredient (\u201cAPI\u201d) suppliers for BELBUCA and Symproic. We purchase our pharmaceutical ingredients pursuant to long-term supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers. The failure of a supplier, including a subcontractor, to deliver on schedule could delay or interrupt the development or commercialization process and thereby adversely affect our operating results. In addition, a disruption in the commercial supply of or a significant increase in the cost of the API from any of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our BELBUCA and Symproic business, which would affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn 2020, we utilized only one contract manufacturer to create the BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL laminates and an additional two contract manufacturer to package the laminates into final product. We utilize only one contract manufacturer to create the Symproic tablets and only one contract manufacturer to package the tablets into final product. We have made significant progress during 2020 in developing additional secondary suppliers for all products. Although we have long term supply agreements with these vendors, any problems or regulatory issues at any of these vendors could create significant BELBUCA and Symproic supply delays. The reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in:\n\u2022delays associated with development and non-clinical and clinical trials due to an inability to timely obtain a single or limited source component;\n\u2022inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of API and an adequate supply of required components; and\n\u2022reduced control over pricing, quality and timely delivery.\nOur relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers are particularly important to us and any loss of or material diminution of their capabilities due to factors such as regulatory issues, accidents, acts of God, extreme weather events, pandemics, labor issues and strikes, or any other factor beyond our reasonable control would have a material adverse effect on our company. Any loss of or interruption in the supply of components from our suppliers or other third-party suppliers would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or require us to manufacture these components internally, which we are currently not able to do.\nIf the supply of any components is lost or interrupted, API, product or components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient quality or in volumes within required time frames, if at all, to meet our or our partners\u2019 needs. This could delay our ability to complete clinical trials, obtain approval for commercialization or commence marketing or cause us to lose sales, force us into breach of other agreements, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or harm our reputation. Furthermore, product or components from a new supplier may not be identical to those provided by the original supplier. Such differences could have material effects on our overall business plan and timing, could fall outside of regulatory requirements, affect product formulations or the safety and effectiveness of our products that are being developed.\nThere are risks associated with our reliance on third parties for managed care, distribution infrastructure and channels.\nWe have entered into agreements with commercial partners to engage in marketing and distribution efforts around our products. We may be unable to establish or maintain third-party relationships on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, these third parties may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors.\nWe may be unable to continue to engage qualified distributors. Even if engaged, these distributors may:\n\u2022fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us;\n\u2022fail to adequately market our formulations or products;\n\u2022cease operations with little or no notice to us; or\n\u2022offer, design, manufacture or promote competing formulations or products.\nIf we fail to develop sales, managed care, marketing and distribution channels, we would experience delays in generating sales and incur increased costs, which would harm our expected financial results.\nThe class-wide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for all transmucosal fentanyl products, and similar programs for other narcotic products, may slow sales and marketing efforts for products that contain narcotics, which could impact our royalty and sales revenue from such products.\nOur approved product ONSOLIS is formulated with the potent narcotic fentanyl. On December 29, 2011, FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all approved transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program and was implemented in March 2012. Additionally, the FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid class. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA falls within the existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors, and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents, or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, and our business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of any product could be delayed.\nActions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and how our company is governed or may seek to acquire control over our company. Some investors (commonly known as \u201cactivist investors\u201d) seek to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. Activist campaigns can also seek to change the composition of our board of directors, and campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction that can arise from potential changes to the composition of our board of directors sought by activists may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business or cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our company.\nCOVID-19 may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our operations, including our efforts to market BELBUCA and Symproic. Any decrease in sales or interruption in supply of any of our products could increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, social distancing and business shutdowns. We have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all home-office employees to work remotely. We have suspended non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and are discouraging employee attendance at other gatherings. These measures could negatively affect our business, although to date that has not been the case. For instance, temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely may induce absenteeism, disrupt our operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. COVID-19 has also caused volatility in the global financial markets and threatened a slowdown in the global economy, which may negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital on attractive terms or at all.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19, including vaccination programs, particularly in the geographies where we or our third party suppliers and contract manufacturers or contract research organizations operate. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nOur failure to obtain government approvals or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations relating to our technologies could delay or limit introduction of any proposed formulations and products and result in failure to achieve revenues or maintain our ongoing business.\nThe manufacture and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the U.S. and abroad. Before receiving FDA or foreign regulatory clearance to market our proposed formulations and products, we will have to demonstrate that our formulations and products are safe and effective in the patient population and for the diseases that are to be treated. Clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing of drugs are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices. As a result, regulatory approvals can take a number of years or longer to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial financial, managerial and other resources.\nIf users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty relating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products.\nThe ability of our company to commercialize BELBUCA and Symproic, or any partners with which we have a licensing arrangement to sell ONSOLIS, will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our proposed formulations and products and related treatments are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and medical services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., which could control or significantly influence the\npurchase of healthcare services and drugs, as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for or rejection of our drugs.\nOur business involves environmental risks related to handling regulated substances which could severely affect our ability to develop our drug delivery technology.\nIn connection with the manufacture of materials and products, we and our partners are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We and our partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. The activities of our manufacturing and commercial partners, both now and in the future, may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals and narcotics. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nGovernment and other efforts to reform the healthcare industry could have adverse effects on our company, including the inability of users of our current and future approved products to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, which could lead to diminished market acceptance of, and revenues from, such products.\nOur ability to commercialize BELBUCA and Symproic alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the product will be available from:\n\u2022government and health administration authorities;\n\u2022private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u2022other healthcare payers.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict what actions the Biden administration will implement in connection with the Affordable Care Act. However, it is possible that such initiatives could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize products in the United States in the future. For example, any changes that reduce, or impede the ability to obtain, reimbursement for the type of products we intend to commercialize in the United States or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business plan to introduce our products in the United States.\nIn addition, we are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013, or the DSCSA. The U.S. government has enacted DSCSA which requires development of an electronic product tracking and tracing of each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.\nIt remains to be seen whether these orders and resulting regulations will remain in force during the Biden Administration.\nWe may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement. Our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may also be subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022the federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock\nOur stock price is subject to market factors and market volatility, both generally and with respect to our industry and our company specifically. As such, there is a risk that your investment in our common stock could fluctuate in value\nThe overall market for securities in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies. In particular, the market prices of securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations (as well as market reactions to particular developments with our company) have and could continue to result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material and/or adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our assets.\nAs of the date of this Report, we have 5,000 issued and 443 outstanding shares of Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, or \u201cSeries B\u201d, which is convertible into 2,461,113 shares of our common stock. We issued the Series B in connection with our $50 million registered direct offering which closed on May 22, 2018. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, our assets will be available to pay obligations on our Series B, in preference to the holders of our common stock. We also have 2,285,700 shares of preferred stock remaining as undesignated shares of preferred stock.\nAdditional authorized shares of our common stock and preferred stock available for issuance may adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nAs of March 9, 2021, there are 101,582,398 shares of common stock issued and 100,861,848 shares of common stock outstanding.\nOn July 23, 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001, of our common stock from 175,000,000 to 225,000,000 shares. This increase in our authorized shares of common stock provides us with the flexibility to issue more shares in the future, which might cause dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. To the extent such options (including options under our stock incentive plan) or warrants are exercised, the holders of our common stock may experience further dilution.\nAdditionally, we have an effective shelf registration which registered up to $125 million of our securities for potential future issuance. To the extent we issue such shares of stock under this registration statement, the current holders of our common stock may experience further dilution.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control, which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of preserving our current management, such as:\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022permitting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022requiring a super-majority vote of our stockholders to remove directors of our company; and\n\u2022providing that our stockholders may only remove our directors for \u201ccause\u201d (as defined in our bylaws).\nThese provisions affect your rights as a stockholder since they permit our board of directors to make it more difficult for common stockholders to replace members of the board or undertake other significant corporate actions. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace our current management team.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to potential peak sales amounts, production and supply dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There may be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in (or incorporated by reference in) this Report should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not invest in our common stock with the expectation that you will receive dividends.", "PERMNO": 89445, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "BDSI"}
