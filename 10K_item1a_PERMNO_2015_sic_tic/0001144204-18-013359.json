{"cik": "1174850", "company": "NICOLET BANKSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. If any of the following risks, or other risks which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Nicolet\u2019s Business\nNicolet may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth, or may encounter issues associated with its growth, either of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and share price.\nWe have grown over the past several years and intend to continue to pursue a significant growth strategy for our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development. We may not be able to further expand our market presence in existing markets or to enter new markets successfully, nor can we guarantee that any such expansion would not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the business, future prospects, financial condition or results of our operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement business strategies. Also, if such growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and the ability to manage our growth. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to manage future growth successfully, there can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or that any growth will be managed successfully. In addition, our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur at any time. We seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management, and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded services.\nAs noted above in Item 1, Business, Nicolet completed its acquisition of First Menasha on April 28, 2017. In addition, Nicolet completed its acquisition of Baylake on April 29, 2016, and completed the hiring of a select group of financial advisors and purchase of their respective books of business and operating platform on April 1, 2016. As evidenced by these acquisitions, we intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business through attractive acquisition opportunities.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves potential adverse impact to our financial results and various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company, payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential volatility in reported income as goodwill impairment losses could occur irregularly and in varying amounts, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, inability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and / or other projected benefits, potential disruption to our business, potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention, and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company.\nAs a community bank, Nicolet\u2019s success depends upon local and regional economic conditions and has different lending risks than larger banks.\nWe provide services to our local communities. Our ability to diversify economic risks is limited by our own local markets and economies. We lend primarily to individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses, which may expose us to greater lending risks than those of banks lending to larger, better-capitalized businesses with longer operating histories.\nWe manage our credit exposure through careful monitoring of loan applicants and loan concentrations in particular industries, and through loan approval and review procedures. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the appropriateness of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses is an estimate based on experience, judgment and expectations regarding borrowers and economic conditions, as well as regulator judgments. We can make no assurance that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, profitability or financial condition.\nThe core industries in our market area are manufacturing, wholesaling, paper, packaging, food production and processing, agriculture, forest products, retail, service, and businesses supporting the general building industry. The area has a broad range of diversified equipment manufacturing services related to these core industries and others. The residential and commercial real estate markets throughout these areas depend primarily on the strength of these core industries. A material decline in any of these sectors will affect the communities we serve and could negatively impact our financial results and have a negative impact on profitability.\nIf the communities in which we operate do not grow or if the prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are less favorable than we have assumed, our ability to maintain our low volume of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned and implement our business strategies may be adversely affected and our actual financial performance may be materially different from our projections.\nNicolet may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, results of operations, and share price.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the quality of our assets, particularly loans. In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that we will experience credit losses. The risk of loss will vary with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\nIf management\u2019s assumptions are wrong, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses, and we may need to make adjustments to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease net income. We expect our allowance to continue to fluctuate; however, given current and future market conditions, we can make no assurance that our allowance will be appropriate to cover future loan losses.\nIn addition, the market value of the real estate securing our loans as collateral could be adversely affected by the economy and unfavorable changes in economic conditions in our market areas. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 40% of our loans were secured by commercial-based real estate, 2% of loans were secured by agriculture-based real estate, and 24% of our loans were secured by residential real estate. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses caused by adverse market and economic conditions, including another downturn in the real estate market, in our markets could adversely affect the value of our assets, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNicolet is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or share price.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations, including compliance with regulatory commitments, is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including the declaration and payment of cash dividends to stockholders, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits, and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth and operations.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry have recently changed and may continue to change, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Some or all of the changes, including the rulemaking authority granted to the CFPB, may result in greater reporting requirements, assessment fees, operational restrictions, capital requirements, and other regulatory burdens for us, and many of our competitors that are not banks or bank holding companies may remain free from such limitations. This could affect our ability to attract and retain depositors, to offer competitive products and services, and to expand our business. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nCongress may consider additional proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions, bank holding companies and financial holding companies. Such legislation may change existing banking statutes and regulations, as well as the current operating environment significantly. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNicolet\u2019s profitability is sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings significantly depend on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have material adverse effects on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nIn addition, we cannot predict whether interest rates will continue to remain at present levels, or the timing of any anticipated changes. Changes in interest rates may cause significant changes, up or down, in our net interest income. Depending on our portfolio of loans and investments, our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. If there is a substantial increase in interest rates, our investment portfolio is at risk of experiencing price declines that may negatively impact our total capital position through changes in other comprehensive income. In addition, any significant increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause customers to request fewer refinancing and purchase money mortgage originations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending or foreclosure practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct.\nCompetition in the banking industry is intense and Nicolet faces strong competition from larger, more established competitors.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience strong competition from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other financial institutions that operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, much larger financial institutions. While we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions, we may face a competitive disadvantage as compared to large national or regional banks as a result of our smaller size and relative lack of geographic diversification.\nAlthough we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary market area with local advertisements, personal contacts, and greater flexibility in working with local customers, we can give no assurance that this strategy will be successful.\nNicolet continually encounters technological change and we may have fewer resources than our competition to continue to invest in technological improvements, and Nicolet\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe banking and financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driving products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nIn addition, we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan functionality and the effective operation of other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Nicolet\u2019s Common Stock\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations or financial condition;\n\u2022 operating results and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022 perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and / or our competitors;\n\u2022 new technology used or services offered by competitors;\n\u2022 significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022 failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022 changes in government regulations;\n\u2022 geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\u2022 available supply and demand of investors interested in trading our common stock;\n\u2022 our own participation in the market through our buyback program; and\n\u2022 recommendations by securities analysts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results.\nNicolet has not historically paid dividends to our common shareholders, and we cannot guarantee that it will pay dividends to such shareholders in the future.\nThe holders of our common stock receive dividends if and when declared by the Nicolet board of directors out of legally available funds. Nicolet\u2019s board of directors has not declared a dividend on the common stock since our inception in 2000 and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of Nicolet\u2019s board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including the company\u2019s future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.\nOur principal business operations are conducted through the Bank. Cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid by the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, is subject to and limited by certain legal and regulatory restrictions, as well as contractual restrictions related to our junior subordinated debentures. Further, any lenders making loans to us may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends by us. There can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future.\nNicolet may need to raise additional capital in the future but that capital may not be available when it is needed or may be dilutive to our shareholders.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate capital levels to support our operations. In order to support our operations and comply with regulatory standards, we may need to raise capital in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on favorable terms. The capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If current levels of volatility worsen, our ability to raise additional capital may be disrupted. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, and our banking regulators may subject us to regulatory enforcement action, including receivership. In addition, the issuance of additional shares of our equity securities will dilute the economic ownership interest of our common shareholders.\nNicolet\u2019s directors and executive officers own a significant portion of our common stock and can influence shareholder decisions.\nOur directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 16% of our fully diluted issued and outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017. As a result of their ownership, our directors and executive officers have the ability, if they voted their shares in concert, to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nHolders of Nicolet\u2019s subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of its common shareholders.\nWe have supported our continued growth by issuing trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures and by assuming the trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures issued by companies we have acquired. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding trust preferred securities and associated junior subordinated debentures with an aggregate par principal amount of approximately $37.1 million and $38.2 million, respectively.\nWe have unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on our trust preferred securities. Also, the junior debentures issued to the special purpose trusts that relate to those trust preferred securities are senior to our common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before we can pay any dividends on our common stock, and in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, holders of our junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock. We do have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures (and related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, but during that time would not be able to pay dividends on our common stock.\nBecause Nicolet is a regulated bank holding company, your ability to obtain \u201ccontrol\u201d or to act in concert with others to obtain control over Nicolet without the prior consent of the Federal Reserve or other applicable bank regulatory authorities is limited and may subject you to regulatory oversight.\nNicolet is a bank holding company and, as such, is subject to significant regulation of its business and operations. In addition, under the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, certain regulatory provisions may become applicable to individuals or groups who are deemed by the regulatory authorities to \u201ccontrol\u201d Nicolet or our subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory authorities have very broad interpretive discretion in this regard and it is possible that the Federal Reserve or some other bank regulatory authority may, whether through a merger or through subsequent acquisition of Nicolet\u2019s shares, deem one or more of Nicolet\u2019s shareholders to control or to be acting in concert for purposes of gaining or exerting control over Nicolet. Such a determination may require a shareholder or group of shareholders, among other things, to make voluminous regulatory filings under the Change in Bank Control Act, including disclosure to the regulatory authorities of significant amounts of confidential personal or corporate financial information. In addition, certain groups or entities may also be required to either register as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, becoming themselves subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve under that Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which may include requirements to materially limit other operations or divest other business concerns, or to divest immediately their investments in Nicolet.\nIn addition, these limitations on the acquisition of our stock may generally serve to reduce the potential acquirers of our stock or to reduce the volume of our stock that any potential acquirer may be able to acquire. These restrictions may serve to generally limit the liquidity of our stock and, consequently, may adversely affect its value.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million) or if our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion in a fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nNicolet\u2019s securities are not FDIC insured.\nOur securities are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of the Bank, and are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, or any other agency or private entity and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of some or all of the value of your investment.", "PERMNO": 15948, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NCBS"}
