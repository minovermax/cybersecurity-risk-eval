{"cik": "1274644", "company": "Ocera Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of our Product Candidates\nWe depend substantially on the success of our product candidate, OCR-002, and we may not successfully complete the development of OCR-002, obtain regulatory approval or successfully commercialize the product candidate.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize OCR-002 for the treatment of hyperammonemia and associated hepatic encephalopathy, or HE, in patients with liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure and acute liver injury. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize OCR-002 is long, complex and costly.\nWe have not submitted a new drug application, or NDA, or received regulatory approval to market for OCR-002 in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing approval by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate's safety and efficacy. OCR-002 and any future product candidates we may develop, may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nOCR-002 and the activities associated with its development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. We are not permitted to market OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA for the product candidate in a particular indication from the FDA. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval.\nThe FDA, European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may form an opinion, after review of our data, that any NDA we may file with the FDA is insufficient to allow approval of OCR-002 for either HE or acute liver failure. The FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical, nonclinical, manufacturing validation or drug product quality studies and submit data from these studies before it will consider or reconsider any NDA we may file. Depending on the extent of these or any other studies, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve the use of OCR-002 for either HE or acute liver failure. If any of these outcomes occur, we may not receive regulatory approval for OCR-002. Even if we obtain FDA approval for OCR-002, the approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for certain age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to significant post-marketing studies or risk mitigation requirements. If we are unable to successfully commercialize OCR-002, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nAny safety or efficacy concerns, including our ability to show a statistically significant reduction in the clinical severity of HE, or delays in enrollment, in our Phase 2b clinical trial, and any future Phase 3 clinical trials we may conduct, could delay or prevent regulatory approval of OCR-002.\nWe are currently conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled double blind Phase 2b clinical trial in 140 patients to evaluate the efficacy of intravenously administered OCR-002 in reducing the severity of HE symptoms among hospitalized HE patients. We commenced this trial in the fourth quarter of 2013 and enrolled our first patient in January 2014. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is time to clinically meaningful improvement in HE symptoms. Secondary endpoints include severity of HE, ammonia reduction, length of hospital stay and time in the intensive care unit, among others. To date, the clinical trials relating to OCR-002 have studied, as a primary endpoint, the ability of OCR-002 to reduce plasma ammonia in patients with liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure. While we believe that a reduction in patient's plasma ammonia levels is linked to the time to clinically meaningful improvement in HE symptoms, which is the primary efficacy endpoint of our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial, and likely to be the primary efficacy endpoint of any future Phase 3 clinical trials we may conduct, the trial results may not bear this out. In addition, in the event that safety concerns are raised by this trial, we may no longer be able to pursue further development or commercialization efforts for OCR-002.\nIn April 2014, we amended the protocol for our Phase 2b clinical to increase patient dosage from up to 10 grams per day to up to 20 grams per day. There can be no assurance that the increased dosage will have a favorable impact on efficacy or that we will be able to meet our clinical endpoints. We intend to release interim analysis for futility and sample size after our observation of a predetermined number of events in our trial. If our interim analysis raises efficacy or safety concerns for OCR-002, or if the remaining sample size needed to achieve statistical significance is not feasible or too costly to undertake, we may need to alter or abandon our current Phase 2b trial, which could prevent us from receiving regulatory approval of intravenously administered OCR-002.\nEnrollment in our Phase 2b clinical trial is ongoing. To increase the pace of enrollment, we amended our trial protocol in March 2014 to broaden the eligible patient selection criteria. In October 2014, we further amended the protocol to broaden enrollment and clarify certain operational aspects of the trial. In addition, we expanded the scope of the trial to\ninclude up to 100 sites in the United States and Europe. In spite of these changes, there can be no assurance that enrollment will occur on a timely basis or that the trial will ever achieve full enrollment.\nAny safety or efficacy concerns, or delays in enrollment, relating to the lone remaining externally sponsored Phase 2a studies of OCR-002 may delay or prevent approval of OCR-002.\nThe Acute Liver Failure Study Group of the National Institutes of Health is funding a Phase 2a study of OCR-002, for the treatment of patients with acute liver injury, as well as those that have progressed to acute liver failure following acetaminophen overdose. Enrollment in this clinical trial is ongoing. In March 2013, the FDA approved less restrictive enrollment inclusion criteria for the study, which we believe will allow for a somewhat more rapid enrollment of patients. However, there can be no assurance that enrollment will occur on a timely basis or that the study will ever achieve full enrollment. In the event that safety or efficacy concerns are raised by this study, we may no longer be able to pursue an acute liver failure indication for OCR-002.\nAn additional Phase 2a investigator-sponsored study tested OCR-002 in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with liver cirrhosis. In the first part of this study, a 10-patient open label safety cohort, OCR-002 was shown to lower ammonia when administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of up to 10 grams per 24 hours. In February 2015, we announced the preliminary topline results of the second part of this study, which was a randomized, placebo-controlled cohort of 38 patients. The data showed that OCR-002 lowered ammonia by 19.6% over the first 12 hours, compared to 3.2% over the first 12 hours in the placebo group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. A statistically significant difference in urinary excretion of ammonia, as measured by phenylacetylglutamine, the key ammonia elimination pathway for OCR-002, was observed and OCR-002 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and appeared to be well tolerated. There can be no assurance that we will observe similar efficacy or safety date in our ongoing Phase 2b trial or that our data will be statistically significant. If the results of Phase 2b trial do not show sufficient safety and efficacy, we may be unable to achieve regulatory approval of intravenously administered OCR-002 for reducing the severity of HE symptoms among hospitalized HE patients.\nThe patient populations suffering from both HE and acute liver failure are small. If we are unable to timely enroll our clinical trials or reach the desired enrollment levels, our development program for OCR-002 will likely be delayed.\nWe estimate that in the United States, the annual number of hospitalizations that involve HE is approximately 175,000 cases, and the annual number of hospitalizations due to acute liver failure is approximately 2,000-3,000. We currently plan to enroll 140 patients in our Phase 2b clinical trial and, if the Phase 2b clinical trial is successful, any future Phase 3 clinical trials we may conduct might include a number of patients that is greater than what we plan to enroll in our Phase 2b clinical trial. If the enrollment in these studies is delayed, it will result in delays in our OCR-002 development program and the time to commercialization.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market OCR-002 in additional indications and formulations, additional costly and lengthy clinical studies will be required, and the results are uncertain.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process, we will conduct, at our own expense, nonclinical and clinical studies for each indication and formulation that we intend to pursue. For example, we are also developing an oral form of OCR-002 with the goal to provide continuity of care for HE patients, where the intravenous form would be used for hospital-based acute care and the oral form for chronic maintenance care post discharge. We are conducting in vitro and in vivo formulation studies of several prototypes of an orally deliverable form of OCR-002. We currently plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2015. We expect that the number of nonclinical and clinical studies that the regulatory authorities will require will vary. Generally, the number and size of clinical trials required for approval depends on the nature of the disease and size of the expected patient population that may be treated with a drug. We may need to perform additional nonclinical and clinical studies, which could result in delays in our ability to market OCR-002 for any additional indications, or in additional formulations.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude or limit approval of OCR-002 to treat HE or acute liver failure.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants or if preliminary data demonstrates that OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized. In addition, regulatory agencies or institutional review boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of OCR-002 to treat HE or acute liver failure, the\ncommercial prospects for OCR-002 will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from OCR-002 may be delayed or eliminated.\nEven though we have received orphan drug designation, we may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for OCR-002.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for OCR-002 for the treatment of both HE and acute liver failure. We have also obtained orphan drug designation in the European Union for OCR-002 for the treatment of acute liver failure and are considering whether to submit such a request for the HE indication in the near future. In the United States, the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in very limited circumstances, including when the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines \"same drug\" as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for OCR-002, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.\nEven if a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory requirements still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses and marketing and the FDA may impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance.\nOCR-002, if approved, will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in any jurisdiction in which we or a partner commercialize the product. In addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory bodies, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product's approved label. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which we do not have FDA or foreign approval, as applicable.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers' facilities; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues from OCR-002, if approved. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results\nwill be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenues from the sale of OCR-002, if approved, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we, OCR-002, any future product candidates we may develop, or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of product, or request us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry.\nIn addition, if OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop are approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, physicians may nevertheless prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and to commercialize OCR-002 and any future product candidates we may develop and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for OCR-002 and any future product candidates we may develop, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the\nmarketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, became law in the United States. The Health Care Reform law is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over OCR-002, our commercial opportunity for such product candidate will be reduced.\nWe face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat HE and acute liver failure. Even if we complete development, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize OCR-002 to treat HE, we will face competition from Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the manufacturer of rifaximin, as well as generic manufacturers of lactulose. Additionally, Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc., or Hyperion, completed a Phase 2 study of glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti\u00ae), or GPB, currently approved for the treatment of urea cycle disorder, for the treatment of HE, which we expect to compete with OCR-002. Hyperion reported that this study met its primary endpoint with significantly fewer patients treated with GPB experiencing HE events as compared to patients receiving placebo. In addition, Hyperion announced that it intends to begin enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study of GPB for the treatment of patients with HE in the second half of 2015. In addition, researchers are continually learning more about liver disease including HE, and new discoveries may lead to new therapies. As a result, OCR-002 may be rendered less competitive. Other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nOur commercial opportunity will be reduced if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than OCR-002. We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully and rapidly complete clinical trials and obtain all required regulatory approvals in a timely and cost- effective manner;\n\u2022\nmaintain patent protection for OCR-002 and otherwise prevent the introduction of generics of OCR-002;\n\u2022\nattract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nbuild an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nmaintain positive relationships with patient advocacy groups.\nThe commercial success of OCR-002 will depend upon the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payors and the medical community. If we fail to obtain and sustain adequate reimbursement of OCR-002 from commercial third-party and government payors, our revenue will be more limited and it will be more difficult to achieve profitability.\nOCR-002 may not gain sufficient market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payors and the medical community and our business may suffer. The degree of market acceptance of OCR-002 will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of OCR-002 as compared to other products indicated for HE or other similar disorders;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe market price and patient out-of-pocket costs of OCR-002 relative to other treatment options, including any generics;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nwillingness by patients to stop using current treatments and adopt a new treatment;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on healthcare provider prescribing of and patient access to our products due to a REMS;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our marketing and distribution organizations;\n\u2022\nthe quality of our relationship with patient advocacy groups; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for OCR-002 by commercial third-party and governmental payors, our sales, revenue and gross margins would be adversely affected, and we may not find it commercially viable. Third-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the United States health care industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nReimbursement in the European Union must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months.\nIf we are unable to establish an organization capable of successfully commercializing OCR-002 in the United States, our business may be harmed.\nWe currently do not have an organization capable of commercializing an approved drug candidate. If OCR-002 is approved by the FDA for commercial sale, we may choose to market OCR-002 directly to physicians in the United States through our own sales and marketing force and related internal commercialization infrastructure. We will need to incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to establish and train an internal sales and marketing force to market and sell OCR-002. We may not be able to successfully establish these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. We will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. In the event we are unable to successfully market and promote OCR-002, our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to establish an effective distribution process utilizing specialty pharmacies, our business could suffer materially and our stock price could decline.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products to patients. We intend to contract with a third-party logistics company to warehouse these products and distribute them to specialty pharmacies. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions which require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network will require significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. Failure to secure contracts with a logistics company and specialty pharmacies could negatively impact the distribution of our products, and failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact its ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively\nestablish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of our products will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, the use of specialty pharmacies involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these specialty pharmacies will:\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products, or complaints regarding our products;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support our products;\n\u2022\nreduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support our products;\n\u2022\nnot devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u2022\nnot comply with any requirements imposed on pharmacies through REMS;\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us; or\n\u2022\ncease operations.\nAny such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.\nEven if the FDA approves OCR-002 in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize OCR-002 outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.\nIn order to market OCR-002 outside of the United States, we must comply with the regulatory requirements of, and obtain the required regulatory approvals in, other countries. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of OCR-002 in those countries. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we are subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to grow and ultimately maintain our sales in foreign markets. We may rely on third parties to support our foreign operations.\nAny foreign operations we establish in the future subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nour customers' ability to obtain reimbursement for procedures using our products in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nour inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties who may not put the same priority on our products as we would;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection times;\n\u2022\nlonger lead times for shipping;\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers for technical training;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our products could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize OCR-002 outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf OCR-002 is approved outside the United States, we will likely enter into agreements with third parties to commercialize and distribute OCR-002 outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into or maintaining these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, conduct clinical trials and commercialize OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, as well as other senior scientists and members of our management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals or one or more of our other members of senior management could delay or prevent the successful development of OCR-002 or the commercialization of OCR-002 or any other product candidates we may develop. We need to hire and retain qualified personnel for the development, manufacture and commercialization of drugs. We could experience problems in the future attracting and retaining qualified employees. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals fields is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms who have the expertise we need to sustain and grow our business.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various federal and state health care \"fraud and abuse\" laws, including anti- kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors, including government payors, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that we are not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that GMP manufacturing violations or off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks has resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental health care programs. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as its relevant amendments, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors. In addition, California and a few other states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. In addition, several states impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are\nambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties.\nNeither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of its practices may be challenged under these laws. While we believe we has structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, it is possible that the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating, these laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts in the foreseeable future will be focused on completing the development and obtaining regulatory approval of OCR-002. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on stockholders' deficit and working capital.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our most advanced product candidates.\nWe will need to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, including the development and commercialization of OCR-002 and to support sales and marketing activities. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our current, planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of OCR-002 and any other product candidates we may develop;\n\u2022\npayments of milestones and royalties to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities in selected markets;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of establishing collaborations, license agreements and other partnerships on terms favorable to us;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nany changes made to, or new developments in, our restated collaboration agreement with UCL Business PLC, or UCL, or any new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish.\nWe have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products and do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may raise additional funds through collaborations and public or private debt or equity financings. Additional funds may not be available when needed on terms that are acceptable, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating requirements through at least the next twelve months. This estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove wrong, and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause the consumption of capital more rapidly than currently anticipated. Inability to obtain funding when needed could seriously harm the business.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nApplicable accounting standards requires that we test assets determined to have long lives for impairment on an annual, or on an interim basis if certain events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying value. In addition, long-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes\nin circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decrease in the fair value of a long-lived asset, an adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition or an expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated life are among several of the factors that could result in an impairment charge. We intend to evaluate the carrying value of our assets to determine if the merger and private placement indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Such a review could result in an impairment charge, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe currently depend on third parties to conduct some of the operations of our clinical trials in connection with the development and application for regulatory approval of OCR-002.\nWe rely on numerous third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to oversee some of the operations of our clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis. As a result, we may face additional delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in accordance with regulatory requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations and meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our financial results and the commercial prospects for OCR-002 or our other potential product candidates could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales could be delayed.\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of any product. We have no experience in drug formulation, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture OCR-002 on a clinical or commercial scale. We do not intend to develop facilities for the manufacture of drug substance for clinical trials or products for commercial purposes in the foreseeable future. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and drug products required for our clinical trial of OCR-002 and for developing the oral formulation of OCR-002. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our products if and when approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities. We have clinical supplies of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for OCR-002 manufactured for us by a single drug substance supplier Helsinn Chemicals SA. The OCR-002 finished product manufacturing and filling is undertaken by AAI Pharma Service Corp. on our behalf. We have not secured commercial supply agreements with any contract manufacturers and can give no assurance that we will enter commercial supply agreements with any contract manufacturers on favorable terms or at all. Our contract manufacturers' failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.\nOur existing manufacturer and any future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business. In the event of a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace a third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of our products would be interrupted, resulting in delays and additional costs.\nSome of the intellectual property necessary for the commercialization of our products is or will be licensed from third parties, which will require us to pay milestones and royalties.\nWe have a license agreement on OCR-002 with UCL for worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the product candidate and related technologies for any use. We may be required to make future milestone payments to UCL totaling up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of various milestones related to clinical and regulatory events for OCR-002. We may also be required to pay milestone payments totaling up to $35.0 million upon the achievement of various milestones related to future net sales of OCR-002. We may also be required to pay incremental milestone payments for an additional dosage form. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties in the low to mid-single digits on future net sales of the licensed product.\nWe may become obligated to make a milestone or royalty payments when we do not have the cash on hand to make these payments or have budgeted cash for our development efforts. This could cause us to delay our development efforts, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek additional capital to meet these obligations, which could be on terms unfavorable to us. Additionally, if we fail to make a required payment and do not cure\nthe failure within the required time period, the licensor may be able to terminate our license to use the licensed technology. If our license from UCL is terminated, it will likely be impossible for us to commercialize OCR-002.\nRisks Related to Product Liability\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we will incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit the commercialization of OCR-002 or other products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management's time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nIn addition, while we continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions, we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, our insurance may be inadequate.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We plan to maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of OCR-002, if approved for sale. We currently maintain insurance for the clinical trials of product candidates. Biopharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with clinical trials and commercial use of OCR-002 and other product candidates we may develop, for which existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.\nThe product liability insurance we will need to obtain in connection with the commercial sales of our product and product candidates, if and when they receive regulatory approval, may be unavailable in meaningful amounts or at a reasonable cost. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage obtained, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercial launch of product programs.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nWe place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes because our commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining patent protection for new technologies, products and processes, successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our patents against third party competitors. To that end, we file applications for patents covering compositions of matter or uses of our product candidates or our proprietary processes as well as other intellectual property important to our business.\nWhere appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available for some of the product candidates or technology we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or\nother proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed. We may not develop additional proprietary products which are patentable.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Accordingly, our patent applications may never be approved by U.S. or foreign patent offices and the patents and patent applications relating to our product candidates and technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies. Publication of information related to OCR-002 and future product candidates we may develop may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to these product candidates, including without limitation composition-of- matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nWe own, or have licensed, patents in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions related to OCR-002. Patents that we own or license do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to disclaim part of the term of one or more patents;\n\u2022\nthere may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022\nthere may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which, nonetheless ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022\nthere may be other patents existing in the patent landscape for OCR-002 that will affect our freedom to operate;\n\u2022\nif our patents are challenged, a court could determine that they are not valid or enforceable;\n\u2022\na court could determine that a competitor's technology or product does not infringe our patents; and\n\u2022\nour patents could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations, or could be subject to compulsory licensing.\nIf we encounter delays in our development or clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our products under patent protection would be reduced.\nOthers have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to ours, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or that we or our licensors will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before U.S. or foreign patent offices. In addition, under the America Invents Act of 2011, or AIA, the U.S. patent system, among other things, has transitioned from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file patent system, increases the scope of prior art available for patentability and invalidity determinations for patent applications filed under the first-to-file system, and introduces new procedures, including post-grant review and inter partes review, for challenging U.S. patents once they have granted. The various provisions of the AIA may impact our ability to secure meaningful patent protection for inventions that we develop in the future.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Our research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborators and advisors, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our in-licensed patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing OCR-002 or any future products we may develop.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications we filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. If a court held that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover OCR-002 and any future products we may develop or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize OCR-002 or any future products we may develop unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of OCR-002 or any future products we may develop or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend us or enforce our rights will be costly and time consuming.\nOur ability to defend our intellectual property may require us to initiate litigation to enforce our rights or defend our activities in response to alleged infringement of a third-party. In addition, we may be sued by others who hold intellectual property rights who claim that their issued patents are infringed by OCR-002 or any future products or product candidates. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally.\nIn addition, our patents and patent applications, or those of our licensors, could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, re-examination proceedings, inter-partes review proceedings, post-grant review proceedings, and derivation proceedings. Any of these challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management's time and attention.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at, or performed services for, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar foreign legislation by extending the patent terms and obtaining data exclusivity for OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Capital Stock\nOur principal stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert a significant control over matters submitted to the stockholders for approval.\nOur officers and directors, and stockholders who own more than 5% of our common stock beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. These stockholders, if they acted together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by the stockholders, including the election of directors. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock could be highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which it was purchased. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nresults of the development efforts involving OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop, those of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales of our stock by insiders and 5% or greater stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022\nexpiration or termination of our relationships with our collaborators; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies' stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u2022\naddition, modification or termination of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting OCR-002 or any future product candidates we may develop;\n\u2022\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements; and\n\u2022\nthe achievement and timing of milestone payments under our existing strategic partnership agreements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of the Merger and prior or future offerings of our stock.\nSection 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company's stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to offset future taxable income, if any, with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability.\nIt is likely that the Merger and other sales of our stock, either on a standalone bases or when combined with future transactions, have caused or will cause us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes. In that event, we generally would not be able to use our pre-change loss or credit carryovers or certain built-in losses prior to such ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 and those attributes already subject to limitations as a result of our prior ownership changes may be subject to more stringent limitations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which would increase the number of outstanding shares and could thwart a takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement of at least 75% of the outstanding common stock to amend any of the foregoing provisions.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no\nguarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after legal restrictions lapse, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, a relatively small number of our stockholders own large blocks of shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that public sales of these shares or the availability of these shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce accurate financial statements and on our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are subject to rules and regulations that require us to maintain the effectiveness of both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. In addition, beginning with this Annual Report, we became subject to the requirement to perform an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and obtain a report from our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are not able to maintain adequate compliance with these requirements in future years, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in SEC or other regulatory investigations or proceedings, violations of NASDAQ listing rules and loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, and, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could be required to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and significant management time in complying with these requirements, remediating any material weaknesses that may be identified in the future, or responding to any regulatory investigations or proceedings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts and may not maintain such coverage or obtain research coverage by additional securities and industry analysts. If we do not maintain such existing coverage, and additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 12698, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCRX"}
