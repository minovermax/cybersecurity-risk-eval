{"cik": "1178409", "company": "TIDELANDS BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks, or other risks that have not been identified or which we believe are immaterial or unlikely. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K and the information incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nIf the deferred interest on our junior subordinated debentures is not paid on December 30, 2015, the holders of the debentures may declare a default and exercise various remedies.\nWe supported our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from two special purpose trusts and an accompanying sale of $14.4 million junior subordinated debentures to these trusts. We conditionally guaranteed payment of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts.\nSince December 30, 2010, we have exercised our right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities). We must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before we can pay any dividends on our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the debentures, we may defer payment for up to 20 consecutive quarters without creating a default. Payment for the 20th quarter interest deferral period will be due on December 30, 2015. If we fail to make that payment, the trustees of the corresponding trusts, would have the right, after any applicable grace period, to declare a default and exercise various remedies, including demanding immediate payment in full of the entire balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest of the debentures and pursuing further remedies as a result of the default. We are pursuing available options to pay the interest in arrears, but cannot provide assurances that we will be able to pay these obligations.\nWe have become subject to a Consent Order that will require us to take certain actions.\nOn June 1, 2010, the FDIC and the State Board conducted their annual joint examination of the Bank. As a result of the examination, the Bank entered into a Consent Order, effective December 28, 2010, with the FDIC and the State Board, which contains, among other things, a requirement that our bank achieve and maintain minimum capital requirements that exceed the minimum regulatory capital ratios for \u201cwell capitalized\u201d banks. Under this enforcement action, the Bank may no longer accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. In addition, under the Consent Order, we are required to obtain FDIC approval before making certain payments to departing executives and before adding new directors or senior executives. Our regulators have considerable discretion in whether to grant required approvals, and no assurance can be given that such approvals would be forthcoming. In addition, we are required to take certain other actions in the areas of capital, liquidity, asset quality, and interest rate risk management, as well as to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the State Board regarding our progress in complying with the Consent Order. Any material failure to comply with the terms of the Consent Order could result in further enforcement action by the FDIC. While we intend to take such actions as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of the Consent Order and subsequent FDIC guidance, we may be unable to comply fully with the deadlines or other terms of the Consent Order. For further discussion of the Consent Order, please see below.\nOur Bank may become subject to a federal conservatorship or receivership if it cannot comply with the Consent Order, or if its condition continues to deteriorate.\nAs noted above, the Bank executed a Consent Order with the FDIC and the State Board. The Consent Order requires the Bank to, among other things, implement a plan to achieve and maintain minimum capital requirements. The condition of our loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate and thus continue to deplete our capital and other financial resources. Should we fail to comply with the capital and liquidity funding requirements in the Consent Order, or suffer a continued deterioration in our financial condition, we may be subject to being placed into a federal conservatorship or receivership by the FDIC, with the FDIC appointed as conservator or receiver. If these events occur, we probably would suffer a complete loss of the value of our ownership interest in the Bank, and we subsequently may be exposed to significant claims by the FDIC. Federal conservatorship or receivership would also result in a complete loss of your investment.\nMarket conditions in our markets and economic trends may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nOur business has been directly affected by market conditions, industry trends, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. The ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets has been greatly reduced in recent years. Difficult market conditions and the tightening of credit can lead to increased deficiencies in our loan portfolio and increased market volatility.\nOur future success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in the Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head markets. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the markets in which we operate do not grow as anticipated, our business could be negatively impacted.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively affect the real estate market could hurt our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 78.0% of our loans were secured by real estate mortgages. The real estate collateral for these loans provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability, asset quality and ultimately our capital levels. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and shareholder\u2019s equity could be adversely affected. Acts of nature, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction lending.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction lending usually involve higher credit risks than that of single-family residential lending. As of December 31, 2014, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio: commercial real estate - 46.8%, commercial and industrial - 7.1%, residential construction - 8.4%, and commercial construction - 5.5%. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nCommercial and industrial loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the collateral securing the loans have the following characteristics: (a) they depreciate over time, (b) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (c) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing, and the builder's ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our outstanding commercial real estate loans were equal to 384% of our total capital. The banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, or if credit delinquencies increase, our losses could increase.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans, that the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to assure repayment, and that we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining loan balances. The risk of loss varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, for many of our loans, the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio after considering these and other factors. Based in part on those assumptions and judgments, we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the allowance, we also rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information, including the results of external loan reviews. Despite our efforts, our loan assessment techniques may fail to properly account for potential loan losses, and, as a result, our established loan loss reserves may prove insufficient. If we are unable to generate income to compensate for these losses, they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Higher charge-off rates and an increase in our allowance for loan losses may hurt our overall financial performance and may increase our cost of funds. As of December 31, 2014, we had 24 loans on nonaccrual status totaling approximately $6.8 million, and our allowance for loan loss was $4.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $71,000 as a provision for loan losses, compared to $435,000 in 2013. Our current and future allowances for loan losses may not be adequate to cover future loan losses given current and future market conditions.\nInstitution-specific and/or broader industry-wide events may trigger a reduction in the availability of funding needed for day-to-day operations, resulting in a liquidity crisis.\nWe require a certain level of available funding each day to meet the liquidity demands of our operations. These demands include funding for new loan production, funding available for customer withdrawal requests and maturing time deposits not being renewed, and funding for settlement of investment portfolio transactions. Both institution specific events such as deterioration in our credit ratings resulting from a weakened capital position or from lack of earnings and industry-wide events such as a collapse of credit markets may result in a reduction of available funding sources sufficient to cover the liquidity demands. Such a crisis could significantly jeopardize our ability to continue operations.\nLegislation and administrative actions authorizing the U.S. government to take direct actions within the financial services industry may not stabilize the U.S. financial system.\nUnder the EESA, which was enacted on October 3, 2008, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions and purchase up to $700 billion of troubled assets and mortgages from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Under the Capital Purchase Program (\u201cCPP\u201d), the U.S. Treasury committed to purchase up to $250 billion of preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions. The EESA also temporarily increased FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2009, which was permanently increased to $250,000 under the Dodd-Frank Act.\nOn February 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced the Financial Stability Plan which, among other things, provides a forward-looking supervisory capital assessment program that is mandatory for banking institutions with over $100 billion of assets and makes capital available to financial institutions qualifying under a process and criteria similar to the CPP. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cARRA\u201d) was signed into law on February 17, 2009, and includes, among other things, extensive new restrictions on the compensation and governance arrangements of financial institutions.\nOn July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, a comprehensive regulatory framework that will affect every financial institution in the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other measures, changes to the deposit insurance and financial regulatory systems, enhanced bank capital requirements and provisions designed to protect consumers in financial transactions. Regulatory agencies will implement new regulations in the future which will establish the parameters of the new regulatory framework and provide a clearer understanding of the legislation\u2019s effect on banks. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity, and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, include, among others:\n\u25cf\na reduction in our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets as a result of compliance with heightened capital standards;\n\u25cf\nincreased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks and bank holding companies, and higher deposit insurance premiums;\n\u25cf\nthe limitation on our ability to raise capital through the use of trust preferred securities as these securities may no longer be included as Tier 1 capital going forward; and\n\u25cf\nthe limitation on our ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations.\nNumerous actions have been taken by the U.S. Congress, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, the FDIC, the SEC and others to address liquidity including the Financial Stability Program adopted by the U.S. Treasury. We cannot predict the actual effects of EESA, ARRA, the Dodd-Frank Act, and various other governmental, regulatory, monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the economy, the financial markets, or on us. The terms and costs of these activities, asset prices, and market liquidity, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nNegative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets may adversely affect our operations and results.\nCommercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages may continue to decline. Global securities markets and bank holding company stock prices in particular, have been negatively affected, as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. Negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments, may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and adversely impact our financial performance. We can provide no assurance regarding the manner in which any new laws and regulations will affect us.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to be traded in an active market.\nOur stock is currently quoted on the NASDAQ OTC US market under the symbol \u201cTDBK\u201d. Trading of securities on the OTC market is generally limited and is effected on a less regular basis than other exchanges, such as the NYSE, and accordingly investors who own or purchase our stock will find that the liquidity or transferability of the stock may be limited. Additionally, a shareholder may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our stock. If an active public trading market cannot be sustained, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected and your ability to transfer your shares of our common stock may be limited.\nBecause of our participation in the Treasury Department\u2019s Capital Purchase Program, we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives and other employees.\nUnder the terms of the CPP Purchase Agreement between us and the Treasury, we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the Treasury holds the equity we issued or may issue to the Treasury, including the common stock we may issue under the CPP Warrant. These standards generally apply to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers. The standards include (1) ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution; (2) required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive and the next 20 most highly compensated employees based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives and the next five most highly compensated employees; and (4) agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive. In particular, the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods and may make it more difficult to attract suitable candidates to serve as executive officers.\nLegislation or regulatory changes could cause us to seek to repurchase the preferred stock and warrant that we sold to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program.\nLegislation and regulation that have been adopted after we closed on our sale of Series T Preferred Stock and warrants to the Treasury for $14.4 million under the CPP on December 19, 2008, or any legislation or regulations that may be implemented in the future, may have a material effect on the terms of our CPP transaction with the Treasury. If we determine that any such legislation or any regulations alter the terms of our CPP transaction with the Treasury in ways that we believe are adverse to our ability to effectively manage our business, then we may seek to unwind, in whole or in part, the CPP transaction by repurchasing some or all of the preferred stock and the warrant that we sold to the Treasury. If we were to repurchase all or a portion of the preferred stock or warrant, then our capital levels could be materially reduced.\nOur continued operations and future growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when we need it.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Pursuant to the Consent Order, the Bank is required to achieve Tier 1 capital at least equal to 8% of total assets and Total Risk-Based capital at least equal to 10% of total risk-weighted assets within 150 days. As of December 31, 2014, the Bank is not in compliance with the capital requirements established in the Consent Order. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to comply with the Consent Order, support our operations, and protect against any further deterioration in our loan portfolio. We may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to continue our current operations or further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, your interest could be diluted.\nA large percentage of the loans in our portfolio currently include exceptions to our loan policies and supervisory guidelines.\nAll of the loans that we make are subject to written loan policies adopted by our board of directors and to supervisory guidelines imposed by our regulators. Our loan policies are designed to reduce the risks associated with the loans that we make by requiring our loan officers, before closing a loan, to take certain steps that vary depending on the type and amount of the loan. These steps include making sure the proper liens are documented and perfected on property securing a loan, and requiring proof of adequate insurance coverage on property securing loans. Loans that do not fully comply with our loan policies are known as \u201cexceptions.\u201d We generally underwrite the loans in our portfolio in accordance with our own internal underwriting guidelines and regulatory supervisory guidelines. We categorize exceptions as policy exceptions, financial statement exceptions and collateral exceptions. Interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies allow institutions to originate loans in excess of the supervisory loan to value limits; however, the aggregate amount of such loans should not exceed 100% of total capital.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately $81.2 million of our loans, or 256.5% of our bank\u2019s capital, had loan-to-value ratios that exceeded regulatory supervisory guidelines. In addition, supervisory limits on commercial loan to value exceptions are set at 30% of a bank\u2019s capital. At December 31, 2014, $56.9 million of our commercial loans, or 179.8% of our bank\u2019s capital, exceeded the supervisory loan to value ratio. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 5.3% of the loans in our portfolio included collateral exceptions to our loan policies. As a result of these exceptions, those loans may have a higher risk of loss than the other loans in our portfolio that fully comply with our loan policies. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory action by federal or state banking authorities if they believe the number of exceptions in our loan portfolio represents an unsafe banking practice.\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates, recent developments in the credit and real estate markets and competition in our primary market area.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings significantly depend upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and net income.\nInterest rates remained steady for 2014 and 2013. Approximately 31.0% of our loans were variable rate loans at December 31, 2014. The interest rates on a significant segment of these loans decrease when the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. However the interest that we earn on our assets may not change in the same amount or at the same rates as the interest rates we must pay on our sources of funds. Accordingly, increases in interest rates may reduce our net interest income due to increasing costs of funds. In addition, an increase in interest rates may decrease the demand for loans. Furthermore, increases in interest rates will add to the expenses of our borrowers, which may adversely affect their ability to repay their loans with us.\nAn increase in nonperforming loans and an increase in interest rates could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods. This reduction in net interest income may also be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market areas. Any significant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher FDIC Deposit Insurance premiums and assessments that we are required to pay could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay our liabilities as they come due.\nAlthough we cannot predict what the FDIC insurance assessment rates will be in the future, further deterioration in either risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nThe goal of liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this goal, our asset/liability committee establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding sources.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through traditional deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans, issuance of additional equity securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities and with terms acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that impact us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, a change in our status from well-capitalized to adequately capitalized, or regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets and negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nTraditionally, the primary sources of funds of our bank subsidiary have been customer deposits and loan repayments. As of December 31, 2014, we had no brokered deposits. Because of the Consent Order, we may not accept brokered deposits unless a waiver is granted by the FDIC. Secondary sources of liquidity may include proceeds from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. The Bank\u2019s credit risk rating at the FHLB has been negatively impacted, resulting in more restrictive borrowing requirements. Because we are adequately capitalized, we are required to pledge additional collateral for FHLB advances.\nWe actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances. We cannot provide assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal, and we diversify cash, due from banks, and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure relating to any one of these entities. We routinely review the financials of our counterparties as part of our risk management process. Balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. While we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the correspondent financial institutions fail.\nDue to the Consent Order, we may not accept brokered deposits unless a waiver is granted by the FDIC. Although we currently do not utilize brokered deposits as a funding source, if we were to seek to use such funding source, there is no assurance that the FDIC will grant us the approval when requested. These restrictions could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Additionally, we are restricted from offering an effective yield on deposits of more than 75 basis points over the national rates published by the FDIC weekly on their website.\nThere can be no assurance that our sources of funds will be adequate for our liquidity needs, and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. Specifically, we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that additional borrowings, if sought, would be available to us or, if available, would be on favorable terms. Bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively impacted by the recent adverse economic conditions, as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. If additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe depend on key individuals, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in our markets. The loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely affect our prospects.\nThomas H. Lyles, our president and chief executive officer has contributed significantly to our business. If we lose the services of Mr. Lyles, he would be difficult to replace, and our business and development could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo succeed in our markets, we must identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in these markets. We expect that competition for qualified management in our markets will be intense and that there will be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the community banking industry in these markets. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy requires both management and financial resources and is often lengthy. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage our offices effectively would limit our growth and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of the services of several key personnel could adversely affect our strategy and prospects to the extent we are unable to replace them.\nWe face strong competition for customers, which could prevent us from obtaining customers or may cause us to pay higher interest rates to attract customer deposits.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, this competitive industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services that we do not provide, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services. We also compete with local community banks in our market. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our market, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us.\nWe may not be able to compete with our larger competitors for larger customers because our lending limits are lower than theirs.\nWe are limited in the amount we can loan a single borrower by the amount of the Bank\u2019s capital. Our legal lending limit is 15% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus, or $4.8 million at December 31, 2014. This is significantly less than the limit for our larger competitors and may affect our ability to seek relationships with larger businesses in our market areas. We expect to sell participations only on a limited basis going forward.\nWe will face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisitions or mergers.\nAlthough we do not have any current plans to do so, we may seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nthe time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners;\n\u25cf\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u25cf\ndiluting our existing shareholders in an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nthe time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities before we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u25cf\ntaking a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u25cf\nthe time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations; and\n\u25cf\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nAlthough our management team has acquisition experience at other institutions, we have never acquired another institution before, so we lack experience as an organization in handling any of these risks. There is also a risk that any expansion effort will not be successful.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected because we are exposed to conditions or assumptions different from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which we summarize in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates about the future that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. For example, material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for losses on loans, including valuation allowances for impaired loans, and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe costs of being an SEC registered company are proportionately higher for smaller companies like Tidelands Bancshares because of the requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. These regulations are applicable to our company. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increasing compliance costs, including costs related to internal controls, as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These necessary costs are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors.\nWe are exposed to the possibility that customers may prepay theirs loans to pay down loan balances, which could reduce our interest income and profitability.\nPrepayment rates stem from consumer behavior, conditions in the housing and financial markets, general United States economic conditions, and the relative interest rates on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Therefore, changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. Recognition of deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans are normally recognized over the contractual life of each loan. As prepayments occur, the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed will accelerate. The effect of the acceleration of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment penalties paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time. If prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty, the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated. We recognize premiums paid on mortgage-backed securities as an adjustment from interest income over the expected life of the security based on the rate of repayment of the securities. Acceleration of prepayments on the loans underlying a mortgage-backed security shortens the life of the security, increases the rate at which premiums are expensed and further reduces interest income. We may not be able to reinvest loan and security prepayments at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in a period of declining interest rates.\nGiven the geographic concentration of our operations, we could be significantly affected by any hurricane that affects coastal South Carolina.\nOur operations are concentrated in and our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of loans to persons and businesses located in coastal South Carolina. The collateral for many of our loans consists of real and personal property located in this area, which is susceptible to hurricanes that can cause extensive damage to the general region. Disaster conditions resulting from any hurricane that hits in this area would adversely affect the local economies and real estate markets, which could negatively impact our business. Adverse economic conditions resulting from such a disaster could also negatively affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and could reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans. Furthermore, damage resulting from any hurricane could also result in continued economic uncertainty that could negatively impact businesses in those areas. Consequently, our ability to continue to originate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local and regional economic conditions in this area following any hurricane.\nOur ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock is restricted.\nSince our inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. However, the ability of our bank to pay cash dividends to our holding company is currently prohibited by the restrictions of the Consent Order with the State Board and the FDIC. Even if we decide to pay cash dividends in the future and our regulators permit us to do so, our ability to do so will be limited by the regulatory restrictions described in the following sentence, by the Bank\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends to us based on its capital position and profitability, and by our need to maintain sufficient capital to support the Bank\u2019s operations. The ability of the Bank to pay cash dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other restrictions on its cash dividends that are applicable to South Carolina state banks and banks that are regulated by the FDIC. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we will be unable to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, the CPP Purchase Agreement provides that before December 19, 2010, unless we have redeemed the Series T Preferred Stock or the Treasury has transferred the Series T Preferred Stock to a third party, we must obtain the consent of the Treasury to (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on our common stock, or (2) redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of our common stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the purchase agreement. These restrictions, together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant described in the next risk factor, could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock.\nThe warrant we issued to the Treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nThe ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the CPP Warrant is exercised. The shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately 11.8% of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 2, 2015 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding). Although Treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant, a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant will not be bound by this restriction.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, which may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf our competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.", "PERMNO": 91508, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TDBK"}
