{"cik": "1604738", "company": "Ashford Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe asset management, advisory and hospitality product and services businesses are highly competitive.\nThe asset management, advisory and hospitality product and services businesses are highly competitive. Competition in these businesses is driven by a variety of factors including: asset and investment performance; the quality of service provided to the companies we advise; investor perception of an asset and investment manager\u2019s drive, focus and alignment of interest; terms of investment, including the level of fees and expenses charged for services; our actual or perceived financial condition, liquidity and stability; the duration of relationships with investors; brand recognition; and business reputation. We expect to face competition primarily from other asset, service and investment management firms. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\nother asset managers or advisors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nother asset managers or advisors may offer more products and services than we do or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are;\n\u2022\nAshford Trust, Braemar, and other companies that we may advise may not perform as well as the clients of other asset managers;\n\u2022\nseveral other asset managers or advisors and their clients have significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar management and investment objectives to ours which may create additional competition for advisory opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset managers\u2019 or advisors\u2019 clients may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us or the companies that we advise, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to funding opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these other asset managers\u2019 or advisors\u2019 clients may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to facilitate the acquisition and management by their clients of a wider variety of assets and allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to advise their clients to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities on which we would advise our clients to bid;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset management or advisory companies and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset management businesses are expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome other asset managers or advisors may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets or investments;\n\u2022\nother asset managers or advisors may have more scalable platforms and may operate more efficiently than us;\n\u2022\nother asset managers or advisors may have better brand recognition than us and there is no assurance that we will maintain a positive brand in the future;\n\u2022\nother industry participants may from time to time seek to recruit members of our management or investment teams and other employees away from us;\n\u2022\nan increase in the allocation of capital to our asset strategies by institutional and individual investors could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that we may seek to exploit;\n\u2022\na decrease in the allocation of capital to our asset strategies could intensify competition for that capital and lead to difficulty in raising new capital; and\n\u2022\nthe market for qualified professionals is intensely competitive and our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees.\nOur inability to effectively compete on these and other areas may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe investments of the entities we currently advise and provide other products and services to are concentrated in the hotel industry. Our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector, and we will be significantly influenced by the economies and other conditions in the specific markets in which our asset management clients operate.\nSubstantially all of the investments of Ashford Trust and Braemar and the investments of clients we provide other products and services to are concentrated in the hotel industry. These concentrations may expose such entities, and therefore us, to the risk of economic downturns in the hotel real estate sector to a greater extent than if the investments of such entities were diversified across other sectors of the real estate or other industries. Similarly, we are particularly susceptible to adverse market conditions in areas in which our asset management clients have high concentrations of properties. Industry downturns, relocation of businesses, any oversupply of hotel rooms, a reduction in lodging demand or other adverse economic developments in the hotel industry generally or in areas where our asset management clients have a high concentration of properties could adversely affect us.\nFailure of the hotel industry to exhibit sustained improvement or to improve as expected may adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our business plan is based on management\u2019s belief that the lodging markets will continue to experience stable or improving economic fundamentals in the future. There can be no assurance as to whether or to what extent, lodging industry fundamentals will remain stable or continue to improve. If conditions in the industry do not remain stable or improve as expected, or deteriorate, we may be adversely affected.\nThe project management business acquisition may not be accretive to our stockholders.\nWhile it is intended that the acquisition of our project management business will be accretive to our performance metrics (including after taking into account the possible conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into our common stock), there can be no assurance that this will be the case, since, among other things, the expenses we have incurred as a result of the acquisition may be higher than we anticipated and revenue from the project management business may decrease in the near-term and/or long-term. The failure of the acquisition to be accretive to the Company's stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not manage the integration of the project management business effectively in such a manner that we realize the anticipated benefits of the project management business acquisition.\nWe may not manage the integration of our project management business effectively. The acquisition has been a time-consuming and costly process, and we may encounter difficulties, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the project management business into our existing business in a manner that permits us to operate effectively or efficiently, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nthe risk of not realizing all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays, or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by the completion of the acquisition and integrating the operations of the project management business.\nWe are exposed to risks to which the Company has not historically been exposed, including business risks inherent to the project management business.\nThe project management business exposes us to risks to which we have not historically been exposed. Addressing these risks could distract management, disrupt our ongoing business, or result in inconsistencies in our operations, services, standards, controls, procedures, and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with our lenders, joint venture partners, vendors, and employees or to achieve all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The acquisition of the project management business, and the incurrence of business risks inherent to the project management business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe may be a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the rules of NYSE American and, as a result, would qualify for, and could rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nFollowing the expiration of the voting restrictions in the Investor Rights Agreement, dated August 8, 2018, by and among Ashford Inc., Archie Bennett, Jr., Monty J. Bennett, MJB Investments, LP and Mark Sharkey and other related parties (the \u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d), the Bennetts could, under certain circumstances, potentially control a majority of the voting power of our\nequity securities. As a result, we may become a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NYSE American at such time. Currently, under the rules of NYSE American, a company of which more than 50% of the outstanding voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may be exempt from certain stock exchange corporate governance requirements, which, generally, include the following:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Company's nominating and corporate governance committee consists entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the Company's compensation committee consists entirely of independent directors.\nAccordingly, in the event we become a \"controlled company\" and elect to be exempt from some or all of these corporate governance requirements, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE American corporate governance requirements.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies and failure to comply with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries will be subject to substantial regulation, numerous contractual obligations and extensive internal policies. Given our organizational structure, we are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, and other federal, state and local governmental bodies and agencies. We also will be responsible for managing the regulatory aspects of Ashford Trust and Braemar, including compliance with applicable REIT rules. These regulations are extensive, complex and require substantial management time and attention. If we fail to comply with any of the regulations that apply to our business or the businesses of Ashford Trust, Braemar or other entities that we advise, we could be subjected to extensive investigations as well as substantial penalties, and our business and operations could be materially adversely affected. We also will have numerous contractual obligations that we must adhere to on a continuous basis to operate our business, the default of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. While we have designed policies to appropriately operate our business and the entities we advise, these internal policies may not be effective in all regards and, further, if we fail to comply with our internal policies, we could be subjected to additional risk and liability.\nWe may do business internationally, which may subject us to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited experience operating internationally but we may do so in the near future, in our capacity as advisor to an entity with international operations. As a result of any future international operations conducted by us, our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to currency fluctuations, social or judicial instability, acts or threats of terrorism, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, fund transfer restrictions, capital controls, exchange rate controls, taxes, inadequate intellectual property protection, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, changes in legislation or regulations and other additional international developments or restrictive actions. These risks are especially acute in emerging markets. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we may do business have been negatively impacted by recessionary conditions. These jurisdictions may continue to experience increasing levels of stress. In addition, the risk of default on sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations.\nWe may also experience difficulty entering new international markets due to regulatory barriers, the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems. These difficulties may prevent, or significantly increase the cost of, our international expansion.\nIn addition, changes in policies or laws of the U.S. or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, higher taxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international expansion. Any actions by countries in which we conduct business to reverse policies that encourage investment could adversely affect our business. If we fail to realize the anticipated growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nOur ability to raise capital and attract investors for our existing and potential advisory clients and our performance is critical to our ability to earn fees and grow our businesses.\nThe base advisory fees that we earn in our asset management business are based on the total market capitalization of the entities that we advise. Accordingly, our base fees are expected to increase if we are able to successfully raise capital in the equity\nmarkets for our existing and potential clients. Further, the incentive fees we earn in our asset management business will be primarily driven by the outperformance of our clients as compared with their respective peers, based on total stockholder return.\nOur ability to earn these fees is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions, political considerations and capital markets. To the extent that general capital markets activity slows down or comes to a halt, our clients may have difficulty growing. This risk is based on micro- and macro-economic market factors including but not limited to disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, resulting in the lack of access to capital or prohibitively high costs of obtaining or replacing capital. Despite recent improvements, the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge.\nWe are predominantly dependent on Ashford Trust and Braemar as our only current asset management clients for a substantial portion of our operating revenue, the loss of either of which, or their failure or inability to pay any amounts owed to us, including under their advisory agreements, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Ashford Trust and Braemar are also customers of our consolidated subsidiaries that provide products and services to the hospitality industry.\nAshford Trust and Braemar are the only companies for which we currently provide asset management advisory services. Ashford Trust and Braemar are also customers of our consolidated subsidiaries that provide products and services to the hospitality industry. Therefore, our business is subject to the risks of the businesses of each entity. The loss or failure of either company, termination of either advisory agreement, the failure or inability of either company to pay us any amounts owed under their respective advisory agreements or other contracts, and particularly their failure or inability to pay all or a portion of any applicable termination fee, would adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, these companies could sell assets over time, decreasing their market capitalization, and thereby cause our advisory fees and other revenues to decrease, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel with long-standing business relationships. The loss of such key personnel could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our management team and key employees of the businesses we have acquired and may in the future acquire. In particular, the hotel industry and/or investment experience of Messrs. Monty J. Bennett, Douglas A. Kessler, Richard J. Stockton, Robert G. Haiman, Deric S. Eubanks, Jeremy J. Welter, Mark L. Nunneley and J. Robison Hays, III, and the extent and nature of the relationships they have developed with hotel franchisors, operators, and owners and hotel lending and other financial institutions are critically important to the success of our business. The loss of services of one or more members of our management or investment teams could harm our business and our prospects.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we will eventually be required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on their audit of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may suffer.\nOur platform may not be as scalable as we anticipate and we could face difficulties growing our business without significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure.\nWhile we believe our platform for operating our business is highly scalable and can support significant growth without substantial new investment in personnel and infrastructure on a relative basis, we may be wrong in that assessment. It is possible that if our business grows substantially, we will need to make significant new investment in personnel and infrastructure to support that growth. We may be unable to make significant investments on a timely basis or at reasonable costs, and our failure in this regard could disrupt our business and operations.\nIf our portfolio management techniques and strategies are not effective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nOur portfolio management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of our operations in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Any failures in our portfolio management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in our operations and could result in losses.\nWe may grow our business through the acquisition of asset management services contracts, assets or companies, which entails substantial risk.\nWe may determine to grow our business through the acquisition of asset management, services contracts, assets or companies. Such acquisitions entail substantial risk. During our due diligence of such acquisitions, we may not discover all relevant liabilities and we may have limited, if any, recourse against the sellers. We also may not successfully integrate the asset contracts or companies that we acquire into our business and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, to the extent such acquisitions result in us entering new lines of business, we may become subject to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, potentially leading to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Moreover, we may grow our business through joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, control and personnel that are not under our control.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock or a \u201ccontrol premium\u201d for their shares or inhibit a transaction that might otherwise be viewed as being in the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose special stockholder voting requirements on these business combinations, unless certain fair price requirements set forth in the MGCL are satisfied; and\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nOur board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the business combination/moratorium provisions of the MGCL any business combination between us, on the one hand, and any of Archie Bennett, Monty Bennett, any present or future affiliate of Archie Bennett and Monty Bennett, and any entity advised through an advisory agreement by us or a controlled affiliate, including Ashford Trust or Braemar, provided that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors.\nOur bylaws opt out of the \u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions of the MGCL for control share acquisitions by Archie Bennett, Monty Bennett, any present or future affiliate of Archie Bennett and Monty Bennett, and any entity advised through an advisory agreement by us or a controlled affiliate, including Ashford Trust or Braemar.\nSubtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions: a classified board; a two-thirds stockholder vote requirement for removal of a director; a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors; a requirement that a vacancy on the board of directors be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred; and a requirement that the holders of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast request a special meeting of stockholders. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we already require that the number of directors be fixed only by our board of directors; the written request of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the then issued and outstanding shares of capital stock for our stockholders to call a special meeting; and that directors may be removed only for cause and only by the vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least 80% of the outstanding voting power.\nThe effect of the board resolution and by-law provisions is that the business combination/moratorium and control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL would apply to third parties seeking to engage in transactions with the Company unless our board took action in the future to modify these provisions or to approve in advance a transaction by which a third party would become an interested stockholder or to exempt a control share acquisition from the applicable provision of the MGCL. Additionally, our board has not taken any action to limit its ability to elect for us to become subject to any of the provisions of Subtitle 8 of the MGCL.\nIn addition, the MGCL provides that an act of a director relating to or affecting an acquisition or a potential acquisition of control of a corporation may not be subject to a higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director. Hence, directors of a Maryland corporation may not be required to act in certain takeover situations under the same standards of care or be subject to the same standard of judicial review as apply in Delaware and other corporate jurisdictions.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us while the plan remains in effect.\nWe have in effect a shareholder rights plan that is intended to protect us from efforts to obtain control of our company that our board of directors believe are inconsistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders. The rights will be exercisable ten days following the earlier of the public announcement that a stockholder (other than us, one of our subsidiaries or employee benefit plans or Mr. Monty J. Bennett and certain of his affiliates and associates (so long as they beneficially own 20% or less of our common stock)) has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors or the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in the ownership of 10% or more of our common stock by a person or group of persons (other than one or more of the excluded persons described above). The rights also become exercisable if a person or group that already beneficially owns 10% or more of our common stock (other than one or more of the excluded persons described above) acquires any additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. If the rights become exercisable, all rights holders (other than the person/entity triggering the rights) will be entitled to acquire certain of our securities at a substantial discount. The rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take over our company without the approval of our board of directors, and the rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire our company or a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock, without first negotiating with our board of directors.\nOur board of directors may create and issue a class or series of capital stock without stockholder approval.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock, common stock, and blank check stock in one or more classes and to establish the preferences and rights of any class of stock issued. These actions can be taken without soliciting stockholder approval. Our ability to classify and issue additional shares of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur board of directors can take many actions without stockholder approval.\nOur board of directors has overall authority to oversee our operations and determine our major corporate policies. This authority includes significant flexibility. For example, our board of directors can do the following:\n\u2022\namend or revise at any time and from time to time our investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, subject to the limitations and restrictions provided in our advisory agreement and mutual exclusivity agreement;\n\u2022\namend our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements;\n\u2022\nissue additional shares without obtaining stockholder approval, which could dilute the ownership of our then-current stockholders;\n\u2022\nclassify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock, blank check stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares, without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nemploy and compensate affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndirect our resources toward investments that do not ultimately appreciate over time\nAny of these actions could increase our operating expenses, impact our ability to make distributions or reduce the value of our assets without giving you, as a stockholder, the right to vote.\nStockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, which increases the uncertainty and risks they face as stockholders.\nOur board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding growth and distributions. Under the MGCL, the authority to manage our business and affairs is vested in our board of directors. Our board of directors may amend or revise our corporate policies without a vote of our stockholders. We may change our corporate policies without stockholder notice or consent, which could result in investments or activities that are different than, or in different proportion than, those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Under the MGCL, our charter and our bylaws, stockholders will have a right to vote only on limited matters. Our board of directors\u2019 broad discretion in setting policies and stockholders\u2019 inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks stockholders face.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe may, to the extent that market conditions permit, grow our business and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our organizational documents do not limit us to the management of assets or operation of service businesses within the hospitality industry. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through acquisitions of asset management and service contracts, assets or companies, acquisitions of critical business partners or other strategic initiatives. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with: (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls; and (iv) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nMaryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter eliminates our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment to have been material to the cause of action. Our charter requires us to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law for liability actually incurred in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made, or threatened to be made, a party, except to the extent that the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was either committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services, or, in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.\nOur charter designates the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if that Court does not have jurisdiction because the action asserts a federal claim, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if that Court does not have jurisdiction because the action asserts a federal claim, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division is the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders or any breach of a standard of conduct of directors; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL, our charter or bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our constituent documents described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our constituent documents inapplicable to, or\nunenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our charter cannot be amended unless our board of directors recommends an amendment and our stockholders approve the amendment.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies unless we opt to do so.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure unless we irrevocably opt to comply with such requirements. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to:\n\u2022\nprovide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\n\u2022\ncomply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer,\n\u2022\nprovide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation, or\n\u2022\nhold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation.\nWe have irrevocably opted into complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies and thus will be required to comply with such standards.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with accounting standards newly issued or revised after April 5, 2012, we may be less attractive to investors, and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting, internal audit and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared and we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nFollowing our separation from Ashford Trust, we became subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(a) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; expand our internal audit function; and hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nFor as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b). We will cease to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2019. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyber-attacks, security problems or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.\nThe protection of business partner, employee and company data is critically important to us. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a\nvariety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, billing and operating data. The collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. Privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to market the Company\u2019s properties and services.\nWe may purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend, and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and other customer information. We depend upon the secure transmission of this information over public networks. Our networks and storage applications are subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. Privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as ransomware, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. In light of the increased risks, we have dedicated additional resources to strengthening the security of our computer systems. In the future, we may expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Despite these steps, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on our systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. In some cases, it will be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, interruption or leakage of our systems could harm us or our reputation and brand and we may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, including, without limitation, loss related to the fact that agreements with our vendors, or our vendors\u2019 financial condition, may not allow us to recover all costs related to a cyber-breach for which they alone are responsible for or which we are jointly responsible for, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation. In addition, employees or others might disclose non-public sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels. The continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks.\nClimate change may adversely affect our business\nTo the extent that climate change does occur, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar located in the areas affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges in laws, regulations, or policies may adversely affect our business.\nThe laws and regulations governing our business or the businesses of our clients, or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the federal level or in any of the states in which we or our clients operate, may change at any time and may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as it is phased in over time, will significantly affect the administration of health care services and could significantly impact our cost of providing employees with health care insurance. The recently enacted tax cuts and JOBS Act may limit the future deductions of interest expense we may incur. We are unable to predict how these or any other future legislative or regulatory proposals or programs will be administered or implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the profitability of our subsidiaries and their ability to make cash distributions to us.\nWe are a holding company and, thus, do not conduct material activities other than activities incidental to holding equity interests of our subsidiaries and being a publicly-traded corporation. We are dependent on the profitability of our legacy advisory business and the acquired project management business, and the ability of our subsidiaries in which these businesses operate to generate cash. As a result, we are substantially dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to fund cash needs. If our subsidiaries are less profitable than anticipated, our cash flows will be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nCash distributions made by the operating companies to fund payments of dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may subject us to taxes to the extent such distributions are treated as a taxable dividend or distribution.\nBecause our ownership in Ashford Advisors Inc. (which owns Ashford LLC, Premier and Ashford Services) is held indirectly through Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC, an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will not be entitled to a 100% dividends received deduction on dividends paid by Ashford Advisors Inc., and instead will only be entitled to a partial dividends received deduction, with respect to amounts distributed by Ashford Advisors Inc. for our benefit that are treated as a taxable dividend. In general, a distribution by Ashford Advisors Inc. is treated as a taxable dividend to the extent any such distribution is made out of Ashford Advisors Inc.'s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). To the extent the amount of such distribution exceeds Ashford Advisors Inc.'s current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of Ashford Hospitality Holdings LLC's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Ashford Advisors Inc. and, to the extent the amount of such distribution exceeds such adjusted tax basis, will be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. Consequently, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of amounts distributed by Ashford Advisors Inc. for our benefit that are treated as a taxable dividend and on the full amount of any such distribution treated as a capital gain. Accordingly, in connection with any distributions made by the operating companies to fund payments of dividends on our preferred stock, additional distributions will likely be required to fund such taxes and any taxes payable on such additional distributions.\nThe representation of the Bennetts on our board of directors may increase if we fail to make certain dividend payments on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\nFor so long as the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock hold at least 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (on an as-converted basis), Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and Monty J. Bennett, during his lifetime, are each entitled to nominate two individuals as members of our board of directors, which are currently Monty J. Bennett and W. Michael Murphy. If we fail to make two consecutive dividend payments to the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, then Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and Monty J. Bennett, during his lifetime, will each be entitled to nominate two additional individuals as members of our board of directors and the size of our board of directors will be increased by two directors to accommodate these nominations. The Bennetts and certain of their affiliates, therefore, would likely have increased control over our operations and management.\nRisks Related to Conflicts of Interest\nCertain affiliated stockholders have the ability to control significant corporate activities of the Company and their interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Archie Bennett, Jr. and Monty J. Bennett (the \u201cBennetts\u201d) directly or indirectly beneficially owned approximately 45.1% of our outstanding common stock (including common units, all vested and unvested options and/or shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted or as-exercised basis), provided that prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing of the project management business acquisition, the voting power of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be limited to 25% of the combined voting power of all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote on any given matter. As a result, the Bennetts may be able to influence or effectively control the decisions of the Company and, following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the project management business acquisition, such holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may, depending on the circumstances at the time, have the voting power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs. In addition, at such time, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of the Company that could deprive our other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company.\nIn addition to their direct or indirect beneficial ownership of the shares of our common stock, the Bennetts are party to the Investor Rights Agreement, under which, for so long as the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and their affiliates continue to beneficially own no less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, they will have the ability to cause the election of two members of our board of directors plus an additional two directors in the event of the non-payment of dividends on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for two consecutive quarters. The Bennetts' interests may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders. The concentrated holdings of our common stock directly or indirectly by the Bennetts, the various provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, and the resulting representation and potential control of our board of directors by the Bennetts may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock if investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nOur separation and distribution agreement, our advisory agreements, our amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement, the tax matters agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with our separation from Ashford Trust, and the agreements entered into with Ashford Trust and Braemar in connection with our acquisition of Premier, were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis, and we may be unable to enforce or may pursue less vigorous enforcement of their terms because of conflicts of interest with certain of our executive officers and directors and key employees of Ashford Trust and Braemar and/or pending or future legal proceedings.\nBecause certain of our officers and one of our directors are also officers of Ashford Trust and Braemar and have ownership interests in Ashford Trust and Braemar, our separation and distribution agreement, our advisory agreements, our amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement, the tax matters agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with our separation from Ashford Trust, and the agreements entered into with Ashford Trust and Braemar in connection with our acquisition of Premier, were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis, and we did not have the benefit of arm\u2019s-length negotiations of the type normally conducted with an unaffiliated third party. As a result, the terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to us as an arm\u2019s-length agreement. Furthermore, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with Ashford Trust, Braemar and Remington Lodging.\nOur deferred compensation obligations may dilute your interest in our common stock.\nOur deferred compensation plan has only two participants, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our chairman and chief executive officer, and his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., chairman emeritus of Ashford Trust. Both Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. have elected to invest their deferred compensation accounts in our common stock. As a result, we have an obligation to issue approximately 196,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Monty J. Bennett over five years beginning in 2021, which is the end of Mr. Monty Bennett\u2019s deferral period. We also have an obligation to issue approximately 8,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., over three years beginning in 2019, which is the end of Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr.\u2019s, deferral period.\nOur relationships with Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust, and Braemar could create significant conflicts of interest.\nOur chief executive officer and chairman, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, serves as the chief executive officer of Remington Lodging, chairman of the board of Ashford Trust and chairman of the board of Braemar. Additionally, Mr. Monty J. Bennett and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., beneficially own 100% of Remington Lodging. Mr. Monty J. Bennett\u2019s obligations to Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust and Braemar reduce the time and effort he spends managing our company, and his duties to us as a director and officer may conflict with his duties to, and pecuniary interest in, Remington Lodging, Ashford Trust and Braemar.\nUnder the terms of our amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, we may be obligated to utilize Remington Lodging as a property manager for hotels, if any, we may acquire in the future as well as future platforms that we advise, to the extent we have the discretion to do so, even if the utilization of Remington Lodging for such property management may not be the most advantageous for our hotels or future clients.\nOur amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging requires us to utilize Remington Lodging to provide property management services (and not project management and development services for all hotels), if any, that we may acquire as well as all hotels that future companies we advise may acquire, to the extent that we have the right, or control the right, to direct such matters, unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously vote not to utilize Remington Lodging for such services or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Remington Lodging because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would be in our best interest not to engage Remington Lodging or that another manager or developer could perform the duties materially better. In exchange for our agreement to engage Remington Lodging for such services for all hotels, if any, that we may acquire as well as all future companies that we advise, Remington Lodging has agreed to grant to any such future clients a first right of refusal to purchase any investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that meet the initial investment criteria of such entities, as identified in the advisory agreement between us and such entities, subject to any prior rights granted by Remington Lodging to other entities, including Ashford Trust, Braemar and us. Mr. Monty J. Bennett will potentially benefit from the receipt of property management fees, project management fees and development fees by Remington Lodging from us and such future companies that we advise. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Our Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington Lodging, Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust, and Master Project Management Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust.\u201d Mr. Monty J. Bennett\u2019s ownership interests in and management obligations to Remington Lodging present him with conflicts of interest in making management decisions related to the commercial arrangements between us, the clients we advise and Remington Lodging.\nUnder the terms of our amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, Remington Lodging may be able to pursue lodging investment opportunities that compete with the businesses that we advise.\nPursuant to the terms of our amended and restated mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, if investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria of Ashford Trust, Braemar or one of our future clients are identified by Remington Lodging or its affiliates, Remington Lodging will give such entity a written notice and description of the investment opportunity. The applicable entity will generally have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If such entity rejects the opportunity, Remington Lodging may then pursue such investment opportunity, subject to any right of first refusal contractually granted by Remington Lodging to any other entity. As a result, it is possible that Remington Lodging could pursue an opportunity that fits within the investment criteria of an entity that we advise and compete with that entity or compete with us. In such a case, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our chief executive officer and chairman, in his capacity as chief executive officer of Remington Lodging could be in a position of directly competing with us or an entity that we advise.\nProvisions of our charter may result in certain corporate opportunities being assigned to Ashford Trust and Braemar.\nOur charter provides that our directors and executive officers who also serve as directors or officers, employees of Ashford Trust or Braemar may refer certain corporate opportunities to Ashford Trust or Braemar or their respective affiliates or successors. No director or officer of ours who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of Ashford Trust, Braemar or any of their subsidiaries will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in the applicable advisory agreement) to Ashford Trust, Braemar or any of their respective affiliates instead of us, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to us. Our charter also renounces all of our rights to business opportunities that are not offered to such directors and officers of Ashford Trust, Braemar or their affiliates exclusively in their capacity as directors or officers of these other entities.\nThe holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock, which may decrease the likelihood, frequency and amount of dividends to holders of our common stock.\nThe Series B Convertible Preferred Stock requires that dividends be paid on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock before any distributions can be paid to holders of our common stock and that, in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. In addition, if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will participate, on an as-converted basis, in such dividend with the holders of our common stock. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of our common stock as a single class on all matters, with the number of votes attributable to each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, subject to the voting restrictions set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement. As a result of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock's superior rights relative to our common stock, including its right to participate in any dividends to the holders of our common stock, the right of holders of our common stock to receive distributions from us may be diluted and is limited by such rights.\nThe holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are expected to benefit from significant cash flows that may create conflicts of interest in our management.\nThe Bennetts and other sellers of the project management business were issued Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in consideration for the sale of such business. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a cumulative dividend rate of 5.50% per year until the first anniversary of the closing of the project management business acquisition, 6.00% per year from the first anniversary of such closing until the second anniversary of such closing, and 6.50% per year after the second anniversary of such closing. As a result of this consideration, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to receive significant cash flow that might otherwise have been used for general corporate purposes. The holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may be incentivized by this consideration to maximize our cash flow, and thus Monty J. Bennett may have conflicts of interest in making management decisions that might be to the detriment of our long-term strategy and success. The cash flow generated by the project management business may not be equal to or in excess of the dividends payable to the holders of the shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in any period.\nCertain of our executive officers, who are also executive officers or board members of Ashford Trust, Braemar, or both, including our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, who is also an executive officer of Remington Lodging and chairman of the board of Ashford Trust and Braemar, face competing demands relating to their time as well as potential conflicts of interest, and this may adversely affect our operations.\nCertain of our executive officers are also executive officers or board members of Ashford Trust, Braemar, or both. Because our executive officers have duties to Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, as well as to our company, we do not have their\nundivided attention. They face conflicts in allocating their time and resources between our company, Ashford Trust and Braemar, as applicable, and they will continue to face increasing conflicts as we advise additional companies and platforms.\nThe organization and management of Ashford Trust and Braemar and any companies we may advise in the future may create conflicts of interest.\nWe are or will be party to advisory and other agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar. These entities, along with any other businesses we may advise in the future will acquire assets consistent with their respective initial investment guidelines, but in each case, we will have discretion to determine which investment opportunities satisfy each such entity\u2019s initial investment guidelines. If, however, either Ashford Trust or Braemar materially changes its investment guidelines without our express consent, we are required to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Ashford Trust, Braemar and other entities we advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any then-existing obligations we may have to such other entities. If a portfolio investment opportunity cannot be equitably divided by asset type and acquired on the basis of such asset types in satisfaction of each such entity\u2019s investment guidelines, we will allocate investment opportunities between Ashford Trust, Braemar and any other businesses we advise in a fair and equitable manner, consistent with such entities\u2019 investment objectives. When determining the entity for which such a portfolio investment opportunity would be the most suitable, our investment professionals have substantial discretions and may consider, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022\ninvestment strategy and guidelines;\n\u2022\nportfolio concentrations;\n\u2022\ntax consequences;\n\u2022\nregulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nliquidity requirements; and\n\u2022\nfinancing availability.\nWe may manage additional investment vehicles in the future and, in connection with the creation of such investment vehicles, may revise these allocation procedures. The result of a revision to the allocation procedures may, among other things, be to increase the number of parties who have the right to participate in investment opportunities sourced by us, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest.\nThe decision of how any potential investment should be allocated among Ashford Trust, Braemar and any other companies we may advise in the future, in many cases, may be a matter of subjective judgment, which will be made by us.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Litigation in connection with conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles.\nOur fiduciary duties as the sole manager of our operating company could create conflicts of interest with our fiduciary duties to our stockholders.\nWe, as the sole manager of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC, which wholly owns our operating company, have fiduciary duties to the other members of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. The operating agreement of Ashford LLC provides that, in the event of a conflict in the fiduciary duties owed by us to our stockholders and, in our capacity as manager of our operating company, to the members of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC, we may act in the best interest of our stockholders without violating our fiduciary duties to the members of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC or being liable for any resulting breach of our duties to the members, subject in all cases to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing which, pursuant to Maryland law, cannot be waived. In addition, those persons holding Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC common units will have the right to vote on certain amendments to the operating agreement (which require approval by a majority in interest of the members, including us) and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. These voting rights may be exercised in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. For example, we are unable to modify the rights of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC members to receive distributions as set forth in the operating agreement in a manner that adversely affects their rights without their consent, even though such modification might be in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, conflicts may arise when the interests of our stockholders and the members of Ashford Hospitality Holdings, LLC diverge, particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the members.\nOur conflicts of interest policy may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our activities.\nIn order to minimize any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our directors, officers or employees, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to address specifically some of the conflicts relating to our activities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of our disinterested directors is required to approve any transaction, agreement or relationship in which any of our directors, officers, or employees, Ashford Trust or Braemar has an interest, there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise. In addition, the transactions and agreements entered into in connection with our formation prior to the separation and distribution have not been approved by any independent or disinterested persons.\nRisks Related to Debt Financing\nAlthough we do not currently have any debt at the corporate level, we have a corporate level revolving credit facility in place and may incur debt in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we currently do not use leverage at the corporate level, we have a corporate level revolving credit facility in place. Also certain of our subsidiaries that provide products and services to the lodging industry use debt, some of which has recourse to Ashford Inc. or Ashford LLC. Our organizational documents do not limit our capacity to use leverage or limit the amount of debt that we may incur. We may, at any time, decide to use leverage to meet future capital needs. We may guarantee, at the corporate level, debt incurred by our subsidiaries. We may also, from time to time, use derivative instruments primarily to manage interest rate risk. Future indebtedness will increase our operating costs, particularly in periods of rising interest rates, and we cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses that may reduce the overall return on your investment.", "PERMNO": 15028, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "AINC"}
