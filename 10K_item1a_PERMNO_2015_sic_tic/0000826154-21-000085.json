{"cik": "826154", "company": "ORRSTOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Credit\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings would decrease.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. The required level of reserves, and the related provision for loan losses, can fluctuate from year to year, based on charge-offs and/or recoveries, loan volume, credit administration practices, and local and national economic conditions, among other factors. The ALL, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired loans, historical loss experience, delinquency, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our ALL.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ALL and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of, or information not available to, management. If loan charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, there would be a need to record additional provisions to increase our ALL. Furthermore, growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. Generally, increases in our ALL will result in a decrease in net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe deterioration of one or more of our significant lending relationships could result in a significant increase in the nonperforming loans and the provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations. A significant portion of our loan customers have been negatively impacted by protocols either required or recommended due to COVID-19. Some industries or sectors have been impacted more than others. In many cases, the projects supporting these loans are not generating adequate cash flow to service the debt. If conditions do not improve or more government assistance is not provided, we may have to look to secondary sources of repayment, including liquidation of collateral or collection from guarantors. Going to secondary sources of repayment typically increases our risk of loss. Some of the industries most impacted and our related loan volume to such industries are in the hospitality sector and commercial real estate.\nFurther, we have elected to delay implementation of ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, under the three-year delay permitted by the FASB in 2019. For a more complete description of the potential impact ASU 2016-13 may have on our financial statements and ALL, please refer to the \"Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition\" risk factor below and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nCommercial real estate lending may expose us to a greater risk of loss and impact our earnings and profitability.\nOur business strategy includes making loans secured by commercial real estate. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than other loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. In challenging economic conditions, these loans represent higher risk and could result in an increase in our total net charge-offs, requiring us to increase our ALL, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nThe credit risk related to commercial and industrial loans is greater than the risk related to residential loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of risk of nonpayment or late payment than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short-term working capital, machinery and equipment financing, and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans. Although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers, the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower\u2019s accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. In a significant number of these loans, the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner\u2019s personal real estate or assets. Commercial and industrial loans are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy, as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline. We attempt to mitigate this risk through our underwriting standards, including evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower and, to the extent available, credit ratings on the business. Additionally, monitoring of the loans through annual renewals and meetings with the borrowers are typical. However, these procedures cannot entirely eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our clients or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We are a participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. On or about April 16, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the $349 billion earmarked for the PPP was exhausted. Congress has approved additional funding for the PPP and President Trump signed the new legislation on April 24, 2020. Since the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached us regarding PPP loans, regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty,\nreduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investments\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment. Operating income, net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, i.e., the difference between the interest yields we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions, and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings and liquidity, could be materially adversely affected. Our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on interest-earning assets fall more quickly than those on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the value of interest-earning assets, which would negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity, and the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. Based on our interest rate sensitivity analyses, an increase in the general level of interest rates will negatively affect the market value of the investment portfolio because of the relatively higher duration of certain securities included in the investment portfolio.\nOur subordinated notes, issued in December 2018, have a 6.0% fixed interest rate through December 2023, after which the interest rate will convert to a variable rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 3.16% through maturity in December 2028. Depending on our financial condition at the time of the rate changing from fixed to variable, an increase in the interest rate on our subordinated debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nThe expected discontinuance of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, issued or held by us that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions, which means it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. Transactions include those in which we lend and borrow money and issue, purchase and sell securities. LIBOR is the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process for setting LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the FRB announced that LIBOR will be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023. Banks were instructed to stop writing contracts using LIBOR by the end of 2021.\nLIBOR is expected to be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, which is a median of rates that market participants pay to borrow cash on an overnight basis, using US Treasury Securities as collateral.\nIf SOFR does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR, there likely will be disruption to all of the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate. Should SOFR ultimately replace LIBOR, risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding loans or other instruments using LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection with transitioning those instruments to a new reference rate and the corresponding value transfer that may occur in connection with that transition. Risks related to transitioning instruments to SOFR or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us and amounts paid on securities we have issued. The value of loans, securities, or borrowings tied to LIBOR and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities could also be negatively impacted upon its discontinuance or phase out.\nFurther, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to 2022 if a sufficient number of banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition from LIBOR would be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time frame for preparing for the transition.\nRisks Related to Competition and to Our Business Strategy\nDifficult economic and market conditions can adversely affect the financial services industry and may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nOur operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. If the growth of the U.S. economy slows, or if the economy worsens or enters into a recession, our growth and profitability could be constrained. In addition,\neconomic conditions in foreign countries can affect the stability of global financial markets, which could impact the U.S. economy and financial markets. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks in connection with volatility in the economic environment:\n\u2022Loan delinquencies could increase;\n\u2022Problem assets and foreclosures could increase;\n\u2022Demand for our products and services could decline; and\n\u2022Collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, could decline in value, reducing client borrowing power, and reducing the value of the assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nBecause our business is concentrated in south central Pennsylvania, the greater Baltimore region, and Washington County, Maryland, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected by economic conditions and real estate values in these market areas.\nOur operations and the properties securing our loans are primarily located in south central Pennsylvania, the greater Baltimore region, and Washington County, Maryland. Our operating results depend largely on economic conditions and real estate valuations in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in the economic conditions in these market areas could materially adversely affect our operations and increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral securing loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing clients\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with nonperforming loans and collateral coverage.\nCompetition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services may adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nWe experience substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans in our market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we are able to charge on these loans.\nAs we expand our online lending capabilities, we will face competition, particularly in residential mortgage lending, from non-bank lenders (financial institutions that only make loans and do not offer deposit accounts such as a savings account or checking account) and financial technology companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. This competition could similarly reduce our net income and liquidity.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including more expansive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of moderate growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOver the long term, we expect to continue to experience organic growth in loans and total assets, the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to successfully execute our business strategies, which includes continuing to grow our loan portfolio. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on the continued availability of loan opportunities that meet underwriting standards. In addition, we may consider the acquisition of other financial\ninstitutions and branches within or outside of our market area to the extent permitted by our regulators. The success of any such acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate the acquired institutions or branches into the current operations of the Company; our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by clients of the acquired institution or branch locations; our ability to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from any acquisition; and our ability to retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of the acquired institution or branches. We believe we have the resources and internal systems in place to successfully achieve and manage our future growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan goals and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by technological advances.\nTechnological advances impact our business. The banking industry undergoes constant technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving client services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our current and prospective clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and clients, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, in order to access our network, products, and services, our clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nWe, our clients, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks. These cyber attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our clients, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings to meet client demand and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years, in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence. Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e. \u201cspear phishing\u201d attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, clients, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial\ncounterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.\nCyber attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with clients and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of clients and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our clients; or damage to our or our clients\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.\nWe receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our clients and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled.\nWe may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.\nWe may become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nWe provide fiduciary services through OFA. From time to time, clients may make claims and take legal action with regard to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether such claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims or legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, the claims or related actions may result in significant financial expense and liability to us and/or adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace, as well as adversely impact client demand for our products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from COVID-19 could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the FRB lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy\nsector. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Mergers and Acquisitions\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Mercersburg, and on May 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Hamilton Bancorp, Inc.\nGrowing by acquisition involves risks.\nWe intend to pursue a growth plan consistent with our business strategy, including growth by acquisition, as well as leveraging our existing branch network and adding new branch locations in current and future markets we choose to serve.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract qualified personnel and maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions and competition. If we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel, control costs and maintain asset quality, this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGoodwill incurred in acquisitions may negatively affect our financial condition.\nTo the extent that merger consideration, consisting of cash and shares of our common stock, exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, that amount will be reported as goodwill by us. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. A failure to realize expected benefits of the mergers could adversely impact the carrying value of the goodwill recognized in the mergers and, in turn, negatively affect our financial results.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired entities over time.\nAcquisitions involve the integration with Orrstown of companies that previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the operations of the acquired companies with Orrstown include:\n\u2022integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u2022integrating departments, systems, operating procedures and information technologies;\n\u2022combining different corporate cultures;\n\u2022retaining existing clients and attracting new clients; and\n\u2022retaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration process could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nThe success of acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses acquired with Orrstown. If we are unable to successfully execute on integration, the anticipated earnings and cost savings to be derived from acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, as with regard to any acquisition, a significant change in interest rates or economic conditions or decline in asset valuations may also cause us not to realize expected benefits and result in the acquisitions not meeting expectations.\nThe market price of our common stock after acquisitions may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares currently.\nThe businesses of the Company and acquired entities may differ and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the shares of common stock of the combined company may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations and market prices of common stock of each separate entity. The market value of our common stock fluctuates based upon various factors, including changes in our business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the merger, regulatory considerations, market and economic\nconsiderations, and other factors. Further, the market price of our common stock after an acquisition may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our common stock.\nAdditionally, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests, and may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may impair our operations or restrict our growth.\nThe Company is subject to regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the promotion of the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders.\nApplicable laws and regulations impose capital adequacy requirements and restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from our subsidiaries. Our ability to service our obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. The FRB requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The FRB could require us to commit resources to the Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of our shareholders or creditors.\nWe are subject to supervision and examination by numerous governmental bodies. The results of these supervisory or examination activities could result in limitations on our ability to engage in new activities or expand geographically. These activities also could result in significant fines, penalties, or required corrective actions, some of which could be expensive and difficult to implement. As we expand our product and service offerings into additional states, there could be an increase in state regulation affecting our operations. Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions could increase our compliance costs or risks of non-compliance.\nFinancial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation, regulation or the application thereof.\nCompliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are subject to less regulation. A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements and expectations could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory or enforcement actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in new activities, and could also injure our reputation with clients and others with whom we do business.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that are required to be paid for FDIC insurance. If there are bank or financial institution failures, the Company may be required to pay significantly higher premiums than the levels currently imposed or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect earnings. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and U.S. state income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes, including the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's provisions for income taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Increases in the assessment rate for the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax, which is calculated on the outstanding equity of the Bank, may also materially adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is required to use judgment in applying accounting policies and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to the reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the ALL, the fair value of certain financial instruments, particularly securities, and goodwill and purchase accounting associated with acquisitions. While we have identified those accounting policies that we consider critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB, SEC and other regulatory bodies change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, that will, upon adoption, substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The update replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management\u2019s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe changes were effective for most publicly-held companies on January 1, 2020. However, in July 2019, the FASB approved permitting \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d, such as Orrstown, up to an additional 3 years to adopt ASU 2016-13. We elected not to adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, and have not yet determined if we will adopt its provisions prior to the extended implementation date of January 1, 2023.\nIn December 2018, the FRB, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules, in part to address the upcoming change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances under ASC 2016-13. The final rule provides an optional three year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard. The impact of this final rule on the Company will depend on whether we elect to phase in the impact of ASU 2016-13 over a three year period. The standard is likely to have a negative impact, potentially materially, to the ALL and our capital position at adoption. When we adopt ASU 2016-13, we will also determine whether we will elect the phase-in provisions for regulatory capital. It is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules have targeted higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital, as domestic and international bank regulatory agencies have sought to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain generally higher levels of capital. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, result in the need for additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements, including limitations on our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the PATRIOT Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the PATRIOT Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nPending litigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nAs more fully described in Note 23, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statement and Supplementary Data,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company believes that the allegations of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's third amended complaint are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend itself against those claims. It is not possible at this time to estimate reasonably possible losses, or even a range of reasonably possible losses, in connection with the litigation. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will not incur any losses associated with this litigation or that any losses that are incurred will not be material.\nIndemnification costs associated with litigation and legal proceedings could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally required, to the extent permitted by Pennsylvania law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in lawsuits. We also have certain contractual indemnification obligations to third parties regarding litigation. Generally, insurance coverage is not available for such indemnification costs we could incur to third parties. Current or future litigation could result in indemnification expenses that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe Parent Company is a holding company dependent for liquidity on payments from its bank subsidiary, which is subject to restrictions.\nThe Parent Company is a holding company and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from the Bank to fund dividend payments and stock repurchases, if permitted, and to fund all payments on obligations. The Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prohibit or reduce the flow of funds from it to us. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, including its depositors.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we are required to maintain to support such growth.\nRisks Related to Owning our Stock\nIf the Company wants, or is compelled, to raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available when it is needed or on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us and our banking subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by our management and board of directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support our business operations. At December 31, 2020, all four capital ratios for us and our banking subsidiary were above regulatory minimum levels to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d banks generally must maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance of our ability to raise\nadditional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us or to raise additional capital at all. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors by diluting earnings per share of our common stock and potentially dilute book value per share, depending on the issuance price. The price at which we issue additional shares of stock could be less than the current market price of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through the issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated variations in our operational results and cash flows, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, trading volume, large purchases or sales of our common stock, market conditions within the banking industry, the general state of the securities markets and the market for stocks of financial institutions, as well as general economic conditions.\nA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.\nA credit rating agency regularly evaluates Orrstown and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Orrstown or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nThe Parent Company's primary source of income is dividends received from its bank subsidiary.\nThe Parent Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Company also has repurchased shares of its common stock. The Company\u2019s primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from the Bank to the Company without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to dividend funds to the Company are included in Note 17, Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global and national economic downturn and unprecedented levels of unemployment, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global, national and local economies and our business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global and national economic downturn and unprecedented levels of unemployment, which has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global, national and local economies and the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are, among other things, severely restricting global and national economic activity, which is disrupting supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. These measures have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the global, national and local economies for a prolonged period of time. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, this economic environment could have a continued adverse effect on our business and operations, including, but not limited to: decreased demand for our products and services; protracted periods of lower interest rates; lower asset management fees; and increased credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, including declining asset and collateral values, which may result in an increase in our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Additionally, our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customer withdrawal of deposits, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and customer draws on lines of\ncredit. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the economy, and/or adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks including those risks related to market, credit, and business operations, or risks described herein.\nIn response to the economic and market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and regulatory authorities, including central banks, have acted to provide fiscal and monetary stimulus to support the global and national economy. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will stimulate the global and national economy or avert recessionary conditions in markets in which we conduct operations.\nWe continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks as they evolve. The magnitude, duration and likelihood of the current outbreak of COVID-19, further outbreaks of COVID-19, future actions taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its future direct and indirect effects on the global, national and local economies and our business and results of operation are highly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause prolonged global, national or local recessionary economic conditions or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nCompetition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and hire sufficiently skilled people to fill open and newly created positions or to retain current or future employees. An inability to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills to fill open positions, or the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience or the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships could be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the clients and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal controls.\nWe rely on our employees to design, manage, and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and manage processes, transactions and other relationships with clients, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. In some cases, we rely on employees of third parties to perform these tasks. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. These concerns are increased when we change processes or procedures, introduce new products or services, or implement new technologies, as we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes.\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on employees, whether ours or those of third parties, to perform these tasks and manage resulting risks, we are subject to human vulnerabilities. These range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance, potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures. Our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business, including risks associated with the design, operation and monitoring of automated systems.\nErrors by our employees or others responsible for systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of those systems and controls could result in significant harm to us. This could include client remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business activities. We could also suffer damage to our reputation, impacting our ability to attract and retain clients and employees.\nWe continue to devote a significant amount of effort and resources to constantly strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations. However, these efforts may not be effective in preventing a breach in, or failure of, our controls.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputational risk, or the risk to the Company's earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities, including banking operations and trust and investment operations, our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues, and our protection of confidential client information. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep and attract clients and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients, communities and vendors, these steps may not be effective.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar events could have a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity plans, such events could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to, or cause travel limitations on, our employees, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. These events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the U.S. or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.", "PERMNO": 92919, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ORRF"}
