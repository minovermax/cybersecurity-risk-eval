{"cik": "1615817", "company": "C&J Energy Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Before investing in our common stock you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including under the section titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d, and in our other reports filed with the SEC, and the documents and other information incorporated by reference herein and therein, for a detailed discussion of known material factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Emergence from Bankruptcy\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nDue to a severe industry downturn beginning in late 2014, on July 20, 2016, the Predecessor C&J Companies voluntarily filed petitions for reorganization seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. On December 16, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Confirmation Order confirming the Restructuring Plan of the Predecessor C&J Companies. On January 6, 2017, the Predecessor C&J Companies substantially consummated the Restructuring Plan and emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding.\nOur recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees, suppliers and others. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining the capital we need to run and grow our business;\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\nour ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities, and current and former employees could pursue claims against us; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been through a Chapter 11 Proceeding will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from our Chapter 11 Proceeding may not be comparable to our projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the course of our Chapter 11 Proceeding, and will not be comparable to our historical financial results as a result of the implementation of our Restructuring Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, as well as our adoption of Fresh Start accounting following emergence.\nWe filed with the Bankruptcy Court projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of our Restructuring Plan and our ability to continue operations following our emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the Chapter 11 Proceeding and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to then prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nAdditionally, in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification No. 852 - Reorganizations, we will apply Fresh Start accounting in our financial statements commencing with our financial statements as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. We expect that this will dramatically impact 2017 first quarter operating results as certain pre-bankruptcy debts were discharged in accordance with the Restructuring Plan immediately prior to our emergence from bankruptcy and our assets and liabilities will be adjusted to their fair values upon emergence. As a result, our financial information subsequent to emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to our financial statements prior to emergence.\nThe warrants we issued in accordance with the Restructuring Plan are exercisable for shares of common stock of the Company. The exercise of such equity instruments would have a dilutive effect to stockholders of the Company.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Plan, on the Plan Effective Date, we issued 1,180,083 warrants that are exercisable into shares of common stock of the Company at an initial exercise price of $27.95 per warrant. In addition, the Warrant Agreement provides for the issuance in the future of up to 2,360,166 warrants to the Unsecured Claims Representative (as defined in the Restructuring Plan) for the benefit of the former holders of Unsecured Creditor Claims (as defined in the Restructuring Plan). The exercise of these warrants into common stock would have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our existing stockholders. The warrants will not expire until January 6, 2024 and may create an overhang on the market for, and have a negative effect on the market price of, our common stock.\nThere is no guarantee that the warrants issued by the Company in accordance with the Restructuring Plan will be or continue to be in the money, and unexercised warrants may expire worthless. Further, the terms of such warrants may be amended.\nIf our stock price is below $27.95 per share, the warrants will have limited economic value, and they may expire worthless. In addition, the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a certain percentage of the then-outstanding warrants originally issued to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. Our common stock has been approved for listing on the NYSE MKT and we expect to begin trading under the symbol \u201cCJ\u201d on March 6, 2017. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors beyond our control such as our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of Fresh Start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Annual Report. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock. Our common stock may be traded only infrequently, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our shareholder base and Board of Directors changed significantly. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those in the past.\nPursuant to our Restructuring Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) changed significantly effective upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding. Our Board is now made up of seven directors, five of which have not previously served on the Board. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nAs a result of the implementation of our Restructuring Plan, we believe our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to limitation under Section 382.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carried forward from prior years. As of December 31, 2016, we reported consolidated federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $530.6 million. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce U.S. federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest ownership percentage during the testing period (generally a rolling three year period). We believe we experienced an ownership change in January 2017 as a result of the implementation of our Restructuring Plan under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that our pre-change NOLs are subject to limitation under Section 382 as a result. Such limitation may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitation were not in effect and could cause our pre-change NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nAs a result of the implementation of our Restructuring Plan, NOLs and other tax attributes may be subject to reduction, causing less NOL or tax deductions to be available to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result of consummating our Restructuring Plan, the obligations of the Predecessor with respect to the Original Credit Agreement (the \"Old C&J Debt\") was canceled and discharged and certain lenders were issued common stock in the reorganized Company (See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Emergence and Note 17 - Subsequent Events). This exchange may give rise to cancellation of debt income (\u201cCODI\u201d) to the extent that the fair market value of the common stock and other rights exchanged with the lenders is less than the adjusted issue price of the Old C&J Debt. Other settlements with holders of Claims under the Restructuring Plan may have resulted in satisfaction of debts for less than the amount of the liability resulting in CODI. The Code provides that CODI arising under a discharge in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding is excluded from taxable income. A taxpayer excluding CODI under these circumstances may be required to reduce certain tax attributes, such as NOLs and depreciable basis by an amount up to the amount of excluded CODI (the \u201cTax Attribute Reduction Rules\u201d). We expect to realize CODI as a result of consummating our Restructuring Plan, but expect to exclude such CODI from our taxable income, which would cause a partial reduction of our tax attributes under the Tax Attribute Reduction Rules. Any reduction in our tax attributes will result in fewer deductions available to offset future taxable income. Based upon our estimate of fair market value as determined under the Code and accompanying tax authorities the estimated CODI and required tax attribute reduction from the effects of the Restructuring Plan will not cause a significant change in our recorded deferred tax liability. Our current estimates show that any required reduction in deferred tax assets recorded for our tax attributes will be less than the valuation allowance that is currently reducing the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in our financial statements. The consummation of the Restructuring Plan occurred in 2017, and the related fair market value, CODI and any associated tax attribute reduction as determined by the Code are estimates at this time and will not be finalized until the 2017 tax return is filed in 2018. Our estimates are subject to change throughout this period.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is cyclical and dependent upon conditions in the oil and natural gas industry that impact the level of exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies. Our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake drilling, completion and production activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors that are beyond our control. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas. If these expenditures decline, our business will suffer. The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile, is highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends. Our customers\u2019 willingness to conduct drilling, completion and production activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including current natural gas storage capacity and usage;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\nthe current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of global and domestic oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other well service equipment in the continental United States and Western Canada;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline of current oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of personnel;\n\u2022\nregulation of drilling activity;\n\u2022\nthe availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nthe discovery and development rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\navailable pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnical advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers.\nVolatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease or remain depressed) generally leads to decreased spending by our customers, which in turn negatively impacts drilling, completion and production activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing drilling, completion and production work is driven by available investment capital for such work. When these capital investments decline, our customers\u2019 demand for our services declines. Because these types of services can be easily \u201cstarted\u201d and \u201cstopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services compared with demand for other types of energy services. Any negative impact on the spending patterns of our customers may cause lower pricing and utilization for our core service lines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSpending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil prices remain at current levels or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending may cause our customers to curtail their drilling programs, including completion and production activities and any discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves, in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nFluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling, completion and production activities by oil and natural gas companies and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. If oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling, completion and production activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices, including current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, completion and production activities, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so. For example, during 2016, NYMEX crude oil prices reached a high of $54.06 per barrel and a low of $26.21 per barrel, and entering 2017 we have recently witnessed prices as high as $54.45 per barrel. In line with the sustained weakness and volatility in oil prices over the course of 2016, we experienced a significant decline in drilling, completion and production activities across our customer base, which resulted in reduced demand and increased competition and pricing pressure to varying degrees across our service lines and operating areas.\nWorldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by OPEC, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other factors that will be beyond our control may also affect the supply of, demand for, and price of oil and natural gas. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower completion and production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and cause lower pricing and utilization levels for our services. If oil and natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a further reduction in drilling and completion activities, the demand for our services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry, and we may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operations and financial position.\nThe successful execution of our growth strategy depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows and our access to capital, both of which are impacted by numerous factors beyond our control, including financial, business, economic and other factors, such as volatility in commodity prices and pressure from competitors. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to continue growing our business, conduct necessary corporate activities, take advantage of business opportunities that arise or engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, which may adversely impact our ability to sustain or improve our current level of profitability. Furthermore, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all, and also could constitute an event of default under our New Credit Facility. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive with significant potential for excess capacity. We may not be able to meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our markets are generally technical expertise, the availability and condition of equipment, work force capability, safety record, reputation and experience. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial resources and greater name recognition than we do and who can operate at a loss in the regions in which we operate. Additionally, some of our competitors provide a broader array of services and/or have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. Our reputation for safety and quality may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain our competitive position, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, significant increases in overall market capacity have caused active price competition and led to lower pricing and utilization levels for our services. Completion and well servicing equipment, such as hydraulic fracturing fleets, can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. For example, natural gas prices declined sharply in 2009 and remained depressed through 2015, which resulted in reduced drilling activity in natural gas shale plays. This drove many oilfield services companies operating in those areas to relocate their equipment to more oil- and liquids-rich shale plays, such as the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin. As drilling activity and completion capacity migrated into the oil- and liquids-rich regions from the gas-rich regions, the increase in supply relative to demand negatively impacted pricing and utilization of our services, particularly for hydraulic fracturing services. Furthermore, as we entered 2015, we experienced a slowdown in activity across our customer\nbase as operators reacted to the rapid decline in commodity prices that began during the fourth quarter of 2014. The entire year proved to be extremely challenging for the North American oilfield services industry due to the sustained weakness and volatility in oil prices at levels that caused severe reductions in drilling, completion and production activities, which in turn resulted in reduced demand and increased competition and pricing pressure to varying degrees across our service lines and operating areas.\nWe may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.\nWe generate revenue from our core service lines, the majority of which is provided on a spot market basis. Pressure on pricing for our core services, including due to competition and industry and/or economic conditions, may impact, among other things, our ability to implement price increases or maintain pricing on our core services. We operate in a very competitive industry and, as a result, we may not always be successful in raising, or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including hydraulic fracturing equipment, may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase or maintain prices. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our profitability.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase our prices as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms.\nOn January 6, 2017, we entered into a new revolving credit and security agreement (the \u201cNew Credit Facility\u201d). Our ability to meet our debt service obligations under, and comply with the financial covenants contained in, our New Credit Facility or future debt agreements depends on our future performance, which is affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including volatility in commodity prices and pressure from competitors. Should our revenues decline, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our debt service obligations when due. Additionally, revenue, utilization and pricing level declines may result in our not being in compliance with one or more of the financial covenants under our New Credit Facility or future debt agreements in future periods. Any failure to satisfy our debt obligations or to comply with the applicable financial covenants could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or should we fail to comply with, or obtain relief from, the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our New Credit Facility or future debt agreements, we may trigger an event of default. Upon such an event of default, our lenders may refuse to fund borrowings and have the right to terminate their commitments and potentially accelerate all of our outstanding debt. If an event of default occurs and the lenders under our New Credit Facility or future debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding. We may not be able to make all required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing is available at that time it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAny reduction of the borrowing base under our New Credit Facility could require us to repay that portion of indebtedness that exceeds the new borrowing base under our New Credit Facility earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity.\nOur New Credit Facility allows us to borrow amounts up to the lesser of $100 million and a borrowing base based on the value of our accounts receivable and inventory. Reductions in accounts receivable and inventory due to events or market forces beyond our control could reduce the amount available to us under our New Credit Facility and could result in a redetermination, and potentially a reduction, of our borrowing bases under our New Credit Facility. If our New Credit Facility eventually becomes fully drawn, any reduction in the borrowing bases could require us to make mandatory prepayments under our New Credit Facility to the extent existing indebtedness under the New Credit Facility exceeds the borrowing base. We may have insufficient cash on hand to be able to make mandatory prepayments under our New Credit Facility. Any failure to repay indebtedness in excess of our borrowing bases in accordance with the terms of the New Credit Facility would constitute an event of default under the New Credit Facility. Such event of default would permit our lenders to accelerate our outstanding debt, which if actually accelerated, would become immediately due and payable and could permit our secured lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing indebtedness.\nWe are subject to restrictive covenants in our New Credit Facility, which may restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe New Credit Facility governing our indebtedness contains, and future debt agreements may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct necessary corporate activities, take advantage of business opportunities that arise and/or to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nSpecifically, our New Credit Facility includes a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and minimum liquidity threshold covenants and restrictive covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, suffer to exist or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or suffer to exist liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital shares;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; and\n\u2022\npursue other corporate activities.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by restrictive covenants under the New Credit Facility, which could: limit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plan; and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nPlease see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Our New Credit Facility\u201d in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information about the New Credit Facility, including the financial and other restrictive covenants contained therein.\nWe may become more leveraged and our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is capital intensive and we may seek to raise debt capital to fund our business and growth strategy. Indebtedness could have negative consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, such as:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nto the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates; and\n\u2022\npreventing our ability to buy back our common stock or pay cash dividends.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, continued low commodity prices, our debt level and other factors may restrict our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Continued low commodity prices, among other factors, have caused some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards which we may not satisfy as a result of our debt level or otherwise, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms, or at all, and in certain instances have reduced or ceased to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms or at all, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nOur top ten customers represented approximately 46.0%, 53.6% and 51.1% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us, revenue would be impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Additionally, if we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels and such loss could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.\nDelays in deliveries of key raw materials or increases in the cost of key raw materials could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials (such as proppant, guar, chemicals or coiled tubing) and finished products (such as fluid-handling equipment). Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary raw materials or finished products or otherwise fail to deliver the products in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, increasing costs of certain raw materials, including guar, may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations, such as proppant and guar, requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of raw materials, including proppants.\nWe are vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth, mergers, acquisitions and expansion.\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to take advantage of and manage the rapid growth that we have experienced, as well as the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties to us:\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient executive-level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nlong lead times associated with acquiring additional equipment;\n\u2022\nability to manage significant levels of idle equipment in sustained periods of depressed oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nability to maintain the level of focused service attention that we have historically been able to provide to our customers.\nIn addition, in the future we may seek to grow our business through acquisitions that enhance our existing operations. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties in integrating the businesses we may acquire.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry.\nRisks inherent to our industry, such as equipment defects, vehicle accidents, explosions and uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to, or destruction of property, equipment and the environment. For example, transportation of heavy equipment creates the potential for our trucks to become involved in roadway accidents, which in turn could result in personal injury or property damages lawsuits being filed against us. In addition, our hydraulic fracturing and well completion services could become a source of spills or releases of fluids, including chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing activities, at the site where such services are performed, or could result in the discharge of such fluids into underground formations that were not targeted for fracturing or well completion activities, such as potable aquifers. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages and could result in a variety of claims, losses and remedial obligations that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The existence, frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue.\nOur operational personnel have experienced accidents which have, in some instances, resulted in serious injuries. Our safety procedures may not always prevent such damages. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable or on terms as favorable as our current arrangements. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and other skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility in the energy service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a different work environment. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. At times, demand for skilled workers in our geographic area of operations is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe depend heavily on the efforts of our executive officers, managers and other key employees to manage our operations. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWeather conditions could materially impair our business.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by severe weather events and natural disasters. Furthermore, our customers\u2019 operations may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. For example, hurricanes, tropical storms, heavy snow, ice or rain may result in customer delays and other disruptions to our services. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules;\n\u2022\nincrease in the price of insurance; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could also delay our operations, reduce our revenue and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect demand for our support services.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly perform hydraulic fracturing services for our customers.\nHydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 that applies to such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances and Control Act that would require the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.\nCertain governmental reviews are also either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.\nVarious state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In addition, state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing fluid disposal practices, including restrictions on the operations of produced water disposal wells and imposing more stringent requirements on the permitting of such wells. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from our customer\u2019s activities by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our fluid transportation business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLocal governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations, increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services that we render for our exploration and production customers. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in cost, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act including one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that requires certain preconstruction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified GHG emission sources, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Air Act that address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions, and also imposes leak detection and repair requirements on operators. The BLM finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. However, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have introduced resolutions seeking to repeal the BLM methane rules under the Congressional Review Act and future implementation of the BLM methane rules is uncertain. In any event, both the EPA and BLM methane rules impose substantially similar requirements.\nFrom time to time the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have established GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, the Paris Agreement is not binding and, at present, the U.S.\u2019s continued participation in the agreement remains uncertain.\nAny new federal, regional or state restrictions on emissions of GHGs that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our customers. Such actions could also potentially make our customers\u2019 products more expensive and thus reduce demand for those products, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services and our business. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if they were to damage our equipment or facilities.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly environmental, and occupational health and safety laws, and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the emission or discharge of substances into the environment, protection of the environment and worker health and safety. Any failure by us to comply with such environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the following:\n\u2022\nissuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nmodification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of limitations on our operations or orders prohibiting our operations altogether; and\n\u2022\nperformance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nAs part of our business, we handle, transport, and dispose of a variety of fluids and substances used by our customers in connection with their oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. We also generate and dispose of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes. The generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of these fluids, substances, and wastes are regulated by a number of laws, including CERCLA, RCRA, Clean Water Act, SDWA and analogous state laws. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, third-party claims, cleanup costs associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources, and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. Moreover, certain of these environmental laws impose joint and several, strict liability even though our conduct in performing such activities was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties was the basis for such liability. In addition, environmental laws and regulations are subject\nto frequent change and if existing laws, regulatory requirements or enforcement policies were to change in the future, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nMore stringent trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs part of the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the DOT, and by other various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, require onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. For example, in December 2016, the DOT finalized minimum training standards for new drivers seeking a commercial driver\u2019s license. Certain motor vehicle operators are required to register with the DOT. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The DOT periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria, and a revocation could result in a suspension of operations. Since 2010, the DOT has pursued its Compliance, Safety, Accountability (\u201cCSA\u201d) program, in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System (\u201cSMS\u201d), which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier\u2019s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow DOT to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. However, in January 2016 the DOT proposed its Safety Determination rule, which would alter the DOT's methodology for determining when a motor carrier is unfit to operate a commercial motor vehicle. A final rule remains pending, and at this time, we cannot predict whether the rule will be adopted as proposed nor the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nNew technology may hurt our competitive position.\nThe energy service industry is subject to the introduction of new techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies before we can. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or products at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to effectively use or implement new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur hydraulic fracturing fleets and other completion service-related equipment require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. The costs of components and labor required to maintain our fleets have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to make our remaining active fleets operational. Our fleets and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our hydraulic fracturing fleets and other completion service related\nequipment and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may increase the cost to make our inactive fleets operational.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We are currently a non-accelerated filer. Accordingly, we are currently exempt from the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and management\u2019s assessment of the design and the operating effectiveness of such internal controls in connection with our 2016 audit. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and partners from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we are seeking to wind-down our international operations, we previously did business and may do business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our employees, intermediaries, and partners may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees, intermediaries, or partners even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws to which we may be subject. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-bribery laws, and have implemented policies and procedures concerning compliance with such laws. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements, however, may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, intermediaries, and partners may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts, the acts of our intermediaries or partners, or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our recent Chapter 11 Proceeding, the implementation of our Restructuring Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The ability to attract and retain the talented employee base that our business demands may be difficult in light of our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to our organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to adjust our compensation structure or enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Stockholders Agreement and our stockholder rights plan may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nclassify the Board;\n\u2022\nlimit removal of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting;\n\u2022\nprohibit action by written consent following the termination of the Stockholders Agreement (as defined below); and\n\u2022\nprovide that only the Board may call special meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. While our stockholder rights plan and the above provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe may issue preferred stock on terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nExcept as provided in a Stockholders Agreement with the Holders (as defined below), dated as of January 6, 2017 (as amended the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as the Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nEach of GSO Capital Solutions Fund II (Luxembourg) S.a.r.l. (together with its affiliates, \u201cGSO\u201d) and Solus Alternative Asset Management LP (together with its affiliates, \u201cSolus\u201d) or certain funds or accounts affiliated with and/or managed by them (each a \u201cHolder\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cHolders\u201d), both currently own approximately 13.4% of our outstanding common stock and are parties to the Stockholders Agreement, which gives them consent rights over certain material transactions. Circumstances may arise in which these Holders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, GSO currently has the right to designate for nomination up to three directors and Solus currently has the right to designate for nomination up to two directors, as well as one non-voting observer, to the Board, subject in each case to maintaining certain levels of share ownership. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that, for so long as the Holders hold specified amounts of our common stock, in addition to the approval of our Board, the approvals of the Holders, in their capacity as stockholders, shall be required for certain corporate actions such as change in control transactions and acquisitions with a value in excess of $100 million.\nIn addition, our concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, of which an estimated 56,217,229 shares were outstanding as of February 24, 2017. This number includes 55,463,903 shares issued in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, almost all of which are freely transferable without restriction or further registration pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. We also have 8,046,021 shares of common stock authorized for issuance as equity awards under the 2017 C&J Energy Services, Inc. Management Incentive Plan, of which 255,570 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding options and 864,130 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock awards. In addition, as of February 24, 2017, warrants to purchase up to 1,178,894 shares of our common stock were outstanding and immediately exercisable, and we may issue in the future up to 2,360,166 Warrants to the Unsecured Claims Representative (as defined in the Restructuring Plan) for the benefit of the former holders of Unsecured Creditor Claims (as defined in the Restructuring Plan). Shares issued upon exercise of these warrants will generally be freely transferable without restriction or registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. We entered into a registration rights agreement, (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with certain of those investors pursuant to which we have agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur (such as upon the filing of the aforementioned registration statement), could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock will have on the price at which our common stock trades or the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16602, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "CJ"}
