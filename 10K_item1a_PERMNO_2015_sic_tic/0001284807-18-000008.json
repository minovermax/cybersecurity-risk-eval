{"cik": "1284807", "company": "PLY GEM HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nThe proposed acquisition of us by CD&R may cause disruption in our business.\nOn January 31, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with an affiliate of CD&R, pursuant to which we will be acquired by CD&R in an all cash transaction. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, without CD&R\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the pending Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger, and may depart prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.\nThe proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe also could be subject to litigation related to the proposed Merger, which could result in significant costs and expenses. In addition to potential litigation-related expenses, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the proposed Merger is consummated.\nFailure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently anticipate the Merger will close in the second quarter of 2018, but it cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the proposed Merger will be satisfied or (if permissible under the Merger Agreement and applicable law) waived. The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under the Merger Agreement applicable law) waived. In the event that the Merger is not completed for any reason, the holders of our common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and holders of our common stock will continue to own their shares.\nAdditionally, if the Merger is not consummated in a timely manner or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from financial markets and our stock price could decline;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties;\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s focus would have been diverted from pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of pursuing the Merger may be higher than anticipated and would be born entirely by us.\nIf the acquisition by CD&R is not completed, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nDownturns or negative trends in the home repair or the remodeling and new construction end markets, or the U.S. and Canadian economies or the availability of consumer credit, could adversely impact our end users and lower the demand for, and pricing of, our products, which in turn could cause our net sales and net income to decrease.\nOur performance is dependent to a significant extent upon the levels of home repair and remodeling and new construction spending, which declined significantly beginning in 2008 and continued through 2013 with recovery commencing in 2014. Housing levels in 2017 remained slightly lower relative to historical averages, despite the recovery the last few years, and are affected by such factors as interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence, unemployment and the availability of consumer credit.\nOur performance is also dependent upon consumers having the ability to finance home repair and remodeling projects and/or the purchase of new homes. The ability of consumers to finance these purchases is affected by such factors as new and existing home prices, homeowners\u2019 equity values, interest rates and home foreclosures, which in turn could result in a tightening of lending standards by financial institutions and reduce the ability of some consumers to finance home purchases or repair and remodeling expenditures. Trends such as declining home values, increased home foreclosures and tightening of credit standards by lending institutions, negatively impacted the home repair and remodeling and the new construction sectors during the recession which began in 2008. Despite the recent abatement of these negative market factors, any recurrence or worsening of these items may adversely affect our net sales and net income.\nWe face competition from other exterior building products manufacturers and alternative building materials. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our sales could decline.\nWe compete with other national and regional manufacturers of exterior building products. Some of these companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to withstand changes in conditions in the industries in which we operate and may have significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. Competitors could take a greater share of sales and cause us to lose business from our customers. Additionally, our products face competition from alternative materials, such as wood, metal, fiber cement, masonry and composites in siding, and wood, composites and fiberglass in windows. An increase in competition from other exterior building products manufacturers and alternative building materials could cause us to lose our customers and lead to net sales decreases.\nAn inability to successfully develop new products or improve existing products could negatively impact our ability to attract new customer and/or retain existing customers.\nOur success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges in the costs and availability of raw materials, especially PVC resin, aluminum and glass, can decrease our profit margins by increasing our costs.\nOur principal raw materials, PVC resin, aluminum and glass, have been subject to rapid price changes in the past and could change in the future from market conditions and other factors including potential tariffs which may be subject to change. While we have historically been able to substantially pass on significant PVC resin, aluminum, and glass cost increases through price increases to our customers, our results of operations for individual quarters can be and have been hurt by a delay between the time of PVC resin, aluminum, and glass cost increases and price increases in our products. While we expect that any significant future PVC resin, aluminum, and glass cost increases will be offset in part or whole over time by price increases to our customers, we may not be able to pass on any future price increases.\nCertain of our customers have been expanding and may continue to expand through consolidation and internal growth, which may increase their buying power, which could materially and adversely affect our sales, results of operations and financial position.\nCertain of our important customers are large companies with significant buying power. In addition, potential further consolidation in the distribution channels could enhance the ability of certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for the products that they purchase from us. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other cost increases. If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our sales, operating results and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause we depend on a core group of significant customers, our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations may decline if our key customers reduce the amount of products that they purchase from us.\nOur top ten customers accounted for approximately 47.5% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2017, ABC Supply Co., Inc., distributes our products within its building products distribution business, and accounted for approximately 12.5% of our consolidated 2017 net sales. We expect a small number of customers to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future.\nThe loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationships with, our largest customer or any other major customer, or loss of market position of any major customer, could cause a material decrease in our net sales. The loss of, or a reduction in orders from, any significant customers, losses arising from customers\u2019 disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or performance or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could cause a decrease in our net income and our cash flow. In addition, revenue from customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers because we provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business. All of our customers are sensitive to economic changes and to the cyclical nature of the building industry. Especially during protracted or severe economic declines and cyclical downturns in the building industry, our customers may be unable to perform on their payment obligations, including their debts to us. Any failure by our customers to meet their obligations to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may incur increased expenses related to collections in the future if we find it necessary to take legal action to enforce the contractual obligations of a significant number of our customers.\nOur business is seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions that could affect the timing of the demand for our products and cause reduced profit margins when such conditions exist.\nMarkets for our products are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions. Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods. Because much of our overhead and operating expenses are spread ratably throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing reduced profit margins when such conditions exist. For example, unseasonably cold weather or extraordinary amounts of rainfall may decrease construction activity.\nIncreases in union organizing activity and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could delay or impede our production, reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nOur financial performance is affected by the cost of labor. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 5.0% of our employees were represented by labor unions. We are subject to the risk that strikes or other types of conflicts with personnel may arise or that we may become a subject of union organizing activity. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where components of our products are manufactured. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our products could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nOur ability to operate and our growth potential could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot employ, train and retain qualified personnel at a competitive cost.\nMany of the products that we manufacture and assemble require manual processes in plant environments. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, employ, train and retain qualified personnel with the ability to design, manufacture and assemble these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force as the housing market continues to recover in the United States and Canada. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our qualified labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. In addition, we believe that our success depends in part on our ability to quickly and effectively train additional workforce to handle the increased volume and production while minimizing labor inefficiencies and maintaining product quality in a housing market recovery. If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease, and any growth potential could be impaired.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from the operations of our various businesses arising from periods prior to the dates we acquired them. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our subsidiaries may be limited, in which case, we would be liable for these claims.\nWe have acquired all of our subsidiaries, including Ply Gem Industries, MWM Holding, AWC Holding Company, MHE, Pacific Windows, Gienow, Mitten, Simonton, and substantially all of the assets of Ply Gem Stone, Canyon Stone, and Greendeck Products, LLC, in the last several years. We may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of our subsidiaries for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental liabilities. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our subsidiaries for these claims or liabilities is limited by various factors, including the specific limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy such claims or liabilities. If we are unable to enforce any indemnification rights we may have against the former owners or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their current financial position, or if we do not have any right to indemnification, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating performance.\nWe could face potential product liability claims, including class action claims and warranties, relating to products we manufacture.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims, including class action claims and warranties, in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products is defective or proves to be defective, among other things, we may be responsible for damages related to any defective products and we may be required to cease production, recall or redesign such products. Because of the long useful life of our products, it is possible that latent defects might not appear for several years. Any insurance we maintain may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Further, any claim or product discontinuance, recall or redesign could result in adverse publicity against us, which could cause our sales to decline, or increase our warranty costs.\nWe could face other types of litigation outside of product liability claims that could result in costly defense efforts.\nWe are from time to time involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, workers compensation and other personal injury claims, warranty disputes, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including class action lawsuits. We have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases. Due to their scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve, and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits. Although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our senior management and certain key employees. To encourage the retention of certain key executives, we have entered into various equity-based compensation agreements with our senior executives, including Messrs. Robinette, Poe, and Wayne designed to encourage their retention. Each member of our senior management team has substantial experience and expertise in our industry and has made significant contributions to our growth and success. We do face the risk, however, that members of our senior management may not continue in their current positions and the loss of their services could cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of key employees, or cause disruptions to our production. Also, we may be unable to find qualified individuals to replace any of the senior executive officers who leave our company.\nOperational problems or disruptions at any of our facilities may cause significant lost production and increased lead times, which could have a negative impact on the efficiency of our production and profitability.\nOur manufacturing processes could be affected by operational problems that could impair our production capability. Disruptions at any of our facilities could be caused by maintenance outages; prolonged power failures or reductions; a breakdown, failure or substandard performance of any of our equipment; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads; fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters; an act of terrorism; or other operational problems. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause a significant loss in production. As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility, which could cause our customers to purchase from our competitors either temporarily or permanently. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruptions in deliveries of raw materials or finished goods could adversely affect our production and increase our costs, thereby decreasing our profitability.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries from suppliers means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. If any of our suppliers were unable to deliver materials to us for an extended period of time, as the result of financial difficulties, catastrophic events affecting their facilities or other factors beyond our control, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these or alternative suppliers, our business could suffer. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us. Even if acceptable alternatives were found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business. Extended unavailability of a necessary raw material or finished goods could cause us to cease manufacturing one or more of our products for a period of time.\nAdditionally, our suppliers may be forced to cease operations unexpectedly due to equipment failures or events beyond their control, such as fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or other environmental catastrophes. Any downtime or facility damage may impact their ability to deliver critical raw materials to us. If any of our key suppliers were to experience such issues and not be able to deliver raw materials for a prolonged period, it would reduce our ability to effectively produce our finished goods, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in building codes and standards could increase the cost of our products, lower the demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur products and markets are subject to extensive and complex local, state, federal, and foreign statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations. These mandates, including building design and safety and construction standards and zoning requirements, affect the cost, selection, and quality requirements of building components like windows and siding.\nThese statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities as to the types and quality specifications of products used in new residential and non-residential construction and home renovations and improvement projects, and governmental authorities can impose different standards. Compliance with these standards and changes in such statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations may increase the costs of manufacturing our products or may reduce the demand for certain of our products in the affected geographical areas or product markets. Conversely, a decrease in product safety standards could reduce demand for our more modern products if less expensive alternatives that did not meet higher standards became available for use in that market. All or any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEnvironmental requirements may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nOur facilities are subject to numerous United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, including those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, use, storage, treatment, disposal and transport of hazardous waste and other materials, investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and protection of worker health and safety. From time to time, our facilities are subject to investigation by governmental authorities. In addition, we have been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties for contamination present at certain offsite locations to which we or our predecessors are alleged to have sent hazardous materials for recycling or disposal. We may be held liable, or incur fines or penalties in connection with such requirements or liabilities for, among other things, hazardous substances used in or released from our current or former operations or products, releases of hazardous substances occurring on or emanating from current or formerly owned or operated properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or for known or newly-discovered contamination at any of our properties from activities conducted by previous occupants. The amount of such liability, fine or penalty may be material. For example, MW, a subsidiary of MWM Holding, entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA relating to contamination at its Rocky Mount, Virginia property. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for the cost of addressing releases of hazardous substances upon certain classes of persons, including site owners or operators and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at contaminated sites.\nIn addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations or in their enforcement, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other liabilities relating to our properties and operations or the inability to enforce the indemnification obligations of the previous owners of our subsidiaries could result in significant environmental liabilities that could adversely impact our operating performance. In addition, we might incur significant capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent United States or Canadian environmental laws or enforcement policies that would decrease our cash flow.\nFinally, while the purchase agreements governing certain of our acquisitions provide that the sellers will indemnify us, subject to certain limitations, for certain environmental liabilities, our ability to seek indemnification from the respective sellers is limited by various factors, including the financial condition of the indemnitor or responsible party as well as by the terms and limits of such indemnities or obligations. As a result, there can be no assurance that we could receive any indemnification from the sellers, and any related environmental liabilities, costs or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to consummate and effectively integrate future acquisitions, if any, will be critical to maintaining and improving our operating performance.\nWe will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions into our business if they provide future financial and operational benefits. Successful completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that we will consummate future acquisitions. In addition, our ability to effectively integrate these acquisitions into our existing business, culture, and financial reporting processes and internal controls may not be successful which could jeopardize future operational performance for the combined businesses.\nManufacturing or assembly realignments may result in a decrease in our short-term earnings, until the expected cost reductions are achieved, due to the costs of implementation.\nWe continually review our manufacturing and assembly operations and sourcing capabilities. Effects of periodic manufacturing realignment, cost savings programs, and labor ramp-up costs could result in a decrease in our short-term earnings until the expected cost reductions are achieved and/or production volumes stabilize. Such programs may include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. Such actions may not be accomplished as quickly as anticipated and the expected cost reductions may not be achieved or sustained.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights. Any threat to, or impairment of, these rights could cause us to incur costs to defend these rights.\nAs a company that manufactures and markets branded products, we rely heavily on trademark and service mark protection to protect our brands. We also have issued patents and rely on trade secret and copyright protection for certain of our technologies. These protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property and we may incur significant costs to defend our intellectual property rights, which may harm our operating results. There is a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will infringe on our intellectual property rights, in which case we would have to defend these rights. There is also a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These third parties may bring infringement claims against us or our customers, which may harm our operating results.\nWe also rely on third party license agreements for certain trademarks and technologies we employ. There is a risk that third parties may modify or terminate such licenses, which may harm our operating results. While these license agreements generally provide that the licensors will indemnify us, subject to certain limitations, for certain infringement liabilities, our ability to seek indemnification from the respective licensors is limited by various factors, including the financial condition of the licensor as well as by the terms and limits of such indemnities or obligations. As a result, there can be no assurance that we could receive any indemnification from licensors, and any related infringement liabilities, costs or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in transportation, freight and fuel costs could cause our cost of products sold to increase and net income to decrease.\nIncreases in transportation, freight and fuel costs could negatively impact our cost to deliver our products to our customers and thus increase our cost of products sold. The Company estimates that a 10% increase in fuel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have increased costs of products sold during such period by approximately $1.0 million. In addition to fuel costs, the availability of truck drivers and lane availability from third party carriers can also negatively impact our profit margins if market prices increase significantly for these freight services. If we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to our customers to cover any increases in transportation and fuel costs, net income may be adversely affected.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nWe have operations in Canada that generated approximately 10.9% of our revenues in 2017. As such, our net sales, earnings and cash flow are exposed to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, which can be difficult to mitigate. For example, during 2017 the U.S. dollar weakened against the Canadian dollar by approximately 2.0%. Depending on the direction of changes relative to the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar values can increase or decrease the reported values of our net assets and results of operations. The change in foreign currency exchange rates had a $4.3 million and $1.1 million net favorable translation impact on our net sales and gross profit, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016 rates. We hedge this foreign currency exposure by evaluating the usage of certain derivative instruments which hedge certain, but not all, underlying economic exposures.\nWe are also exposed to changes in interest rates as the Term Loan and ABL Facility bear interest at variable interest rates. As a result, future interest rate increases will negatively impact our financial results. Our ability to access capital markets could also be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur.\nDeclines in our business conditions may result in an impairment of our tangible and intangible assets, which could result in a material non-cash charge.\nA negative long-term performance outlook could result in a net sales decrease, which could result in a decrease in operating cash flows, adversely impacting our business and results of operations, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These declines could result in an impairment of our tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value.\nThe significant amount of our indebtedness may limit the cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, such as capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates of our ABL Facility and our Term Loan Facility are at variable rates; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nThe terms of our debt covenants and the Merger Agreement could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds.\nThe agreements that govern the terms of our debt, including the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility, the credit agreement that governs the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes, contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur and guarantee indebtedness or issue equity interests of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness prior to its stated maturity;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\n\u2022\nissue capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with stockholders and affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\npay dividends, distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions, in addition to the restrictions under the Merger Agreement, may affect our ability to grow our business and take advantage of market and business opportunities or to raise additional debt or equity capital.\nIn addition, under the ABL Facility, if (a) our excess availability is less than the greater of (x) 10.0% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the borrowing base and (y) $25.0 million or (b) an event of default has occurred and is continuing, we will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test. Our ability to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet this ratio. A breach of any of these covenants under the ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility or the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes could result in an event of default under the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility, and/or the indenture. An event of default under any of our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable and, in some cases, proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nMoreover, the ABL Facility provides the lenders considerable discretion to impose reserves or availability blocks, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the ABL Facility will not impose such actions during the term of the ABL Facility and further, were they to do so, the resulting impact of this action could materially and adversely impair our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful. We may also be unable to generate sufficient cash to make required capital expenditures.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations and to make capital expenditures depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the industry in which we operate and competitive pressures. We cannot assure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay or refinance our indebtedness, including the 6.50% Senior Notes or our indebtedness under our ABL Facility or Term Loan Facility, or make required capital expenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we and our subsidiaries could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nIn addition, if we do not have, or are unable to obtain, adequate funds to make all necessary capital expenditures when required, or if the amount of future capital expenditures are materially in excess of our anticipated or current expenditures, our product offerings may become dated, our productivity may decrease and the quality of our products may decline, which, in turn, could reduce our sales and profitability.\nA downgrade of our external credit ratings could adversely impact our interest expense as well as future borrowings.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost of capital. The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, which include financial strength and business risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. A downgrade in our debt rating could result in increased interest and other expenses on our existing variable interest rate debt, and could result in increased interest and other financing expenses on future borrowings. Downgrades in our debt rating could also restrict our access to capital markets and affect the value and marketability of our outstanding notes.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax law revisions could materially impact our financial results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\"), creating a general limitation on deductible interest expense, and changing rules related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years after December 31, 2017.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) 118 requires that we include in our financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Although we believe these provisional amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the ultimate enactment-related impact the Tax Act will have on our consolidated financial statements, the amounts could be adjusted materially as additional information becomes available and further analyses are completed. The impact of the Tax Act to our business in future periods is also subject to a variety of factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, (i) potential amendments to the Tax Act; (ii) potential changes to state, local, and foreign tax laws in response to the Tax Act; and (iii) potential new or interpretative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Internal Revenue Service and other tax agencies. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materiality from our current expectations and/or investors' expectations and there can be no assurance that the Tax Act will not have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe will be required to pay an affiliate of Ply Gem Holdings\u2019 stockholders for certain tax benefits, including net operating loss carryovers, we may claim, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\nIn connection with Ply Gem Holdings\u2019 initial public offering, Ply Gem Holdings entered into a tax receivable agreement (the \"Tax Receivable Agreement\") with an entity controlled by an affiliate of the CI Partnerships (the \u201cTax Receivable Entity\u201d). The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by us to the Tax Receivable Entity of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in periods after the initial public offering as a result of (i) NOL carryovers from periods (or portions thereof) ending before January 1, 2013, (ii) deductible expenses attributable to the transactions related to the initial public offering and (iii) deductions related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of or attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, our use of NOL carryovers and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest.\nThe payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial. We expect that, as a result of the amount of the NOL carryovers from prior periods (or portions thereof) and assuming that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the potential tax benefit described above, future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, in respect of the federal and state NOL carryovers, would be approximately $74.7 million in the aggregate and may be paid within the next five years, assuming that utilization of such tax attributes is not subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code as the result of an \u201cownership change\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) of Ply Gem Holdings. These amounts reflect only the cash savings attributable to current tax attributes resulting from the NOL carryovers. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments from these tax attributes.\nIn addition, although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to challenge the benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Tax Receivable Entity will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such benefits are subsequently disallowed. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than our actual cash tax savings and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity. However, any excess payments made to the Tax Receivable Entity will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after our determination of such excess.\nFinally, because Ply Gem Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own, its ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and its subsidiaries to make distributions to it. We may be required to make payments to Ply Gem Holdings to fund payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the indenture governing the notes will permit us to make such payments. To the extent that Ply Gem Holdings is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nIn addition, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, upon certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations or certain other changes of control, Ply Gem Holdings\u2019 or its successor\u2019s obligations with respect to tax benefits would be based on certain assumptions, including that Ply Gem Holdings or its successor would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the NOL carryovers covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, upon a change of control, Ply Gem Holdings may be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of actual cash tax savings.\nOur systems and IT infrastructure may be subject to security breaches and other cyber security incidents.\nPurchase of our products may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances customers' business and personally identifiable information. Thus, maintaining the security of computers, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers, as security breaches could result in vulnerabilities and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We may face attempts by experienced hackers, cybercriminals or others with authorized access to our systems to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology, interrupt our business, and/or gain unauthorized access to confidential information. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in a loss or damage to our data, it could cause harm to our reputation or brand. This could lead some customers to stop purchasing our products and reduce or delay future purchases of our products or use competing products; state or federal enforcement action, which could result in fines, penalties and/or other liabilities and which may cause us to incur legal fees and costs, and/or additional costs associated with responding to a cyberattack. Increased regulation regarding cyber security may increase our costs of compliance, including fines and penalties, as well as costs of cyber security audits. Any of these actions could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our third party providers' databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are controlled by the CI Partnerships whose interest in our business may be different than yours.\nThe CI Partnerships own approximately 66.7% of the outstanding common stock of Ply Gem Holdings, the direct parent company of Ply Gem Industries. Ply Gem Holdings has entered into an amended and restated stockholders agreement with the CI Partnerships and certain of our members of management. Under the stockholders agreement, the CI Partnerships are currently entitled to nominate a majority of the members of Ply Gem Holdings' board of directors and all of the parties to the stockholders agreement have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock as directed by the CI Partnerships. Accordingly, the CI Partnerships will be able to exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs. In addition, the CI Partnerships can control any action requiring the general approval of Ply Gem Holdings' stockholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to Ply Gem Holdings' certificate of incorporation or by-laws and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets.\nSignificant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nThe recognition of costs and liabilities associated with our pension plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nOur pension plans were underfunded by $14.2 million as of December 31, 2017. In recent years, the declining interest rates and changes to mortality assumptions have negatively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. In addition, volatile asset performance, most notably since 2008, has also negatively impacted the funded status of our pension plans. Funding requirements for our pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our pension plan obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 13909, "SIC": 2430, "TIC": "PGEM"}
