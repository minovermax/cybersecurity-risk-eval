{"cik": "1311596", "company": "Regado Biosciences Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this Annual Report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include projections about our accounting and finances, plans and objectives for the future, future operating and economic performance and other statements regarding future performance. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part II, Item 7 entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere throughout this Annual Report and in any other documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nRisks Relating to the Company and its Operations\nWe have a history of operating losses and cannot give assurance of future revenues or operating profits; investors may lose their entire investment.\nWe have incurred net losses in all prior reporting periods, including net losses of $67.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $212.1 million. To date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales, we may never attain profitability in the future. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our discovery and development activities.\nWe have announced entry into the Merger Agreement with Tobira. Should the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement not be successfully completed we may never achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or return value to our stockholders. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. If we continue to suffer losses as we have in the past, investors may not receive any return on their investment and may lose their entire investment.\nWe have substantially suspended all clinical development activities and our review of a possible transaction with respect to one or more of our clinical development programs is uncertain.\nIn September 2014, we announced plans to suspend all clinical development activities. Consistent with this announcement, we have substantially suspended all clinical development activities with a goal of conserving capital and maximizing value returned to our stockholders. As a result of our September 2014 announcement, we recorded $10.2 million of non-cash impairment charges related to our other current asset and intangible assets and $2.6 million in accrued severance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Our process to identify and evaluate potential business alternatives includes a review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more of our clinical candidates or other assets. There can be no assurance that our process to identify and evaluate potential business alternatives will result in any definitive offer to acquire our clinical development programs, or if made what the terms thereof will be or that any other transaction involving our clinical development programs will be approved or consummated. If any definitive offer to acquire our clinical development programs is made, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that, if a definitive agreement is executed, the transaction will be consummated. In addition, there can be no assurance that any transaction, involving our candidates and/or other assets, that is consummated would deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability, clinical trial and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. Operating as a public company makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger Transaction\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on our stock price and/or the business, financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects of our company.\nWhile there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could disrupt our businesses in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nthird parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the Merger and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of their respective companies, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our financial condition, results of operations, or business prospects.\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement to Tobira\u2019s consummation of Merger may not be satisfied at all or in the anticipated timeframe.\nThe obligation of Tobira to complete the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under applicable antitrust regulations, the approval by our stockholders and Tobira\u2019s stockholders of certain matters and other customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the accuracy of the representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality qualifications, compliance by the parties with their respective covenants and no law or order preventing the Merger and related transactions. These conditions are described in more detail in the Merger Agreement, as amended, which is filed as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\nWe intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement restricts our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and requires us to pay a termination fee to Tobira if we do.\nThe Merger Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit or encourage or take any action to discuss or accept a competing third party proposal. Although our board of directors is permitted to change its recommendation that shareholders approve the matters relating to the proposed Merger if it determines in good faith that these actions are reasonably likely to be required to comply with its fiduciary duties and certain other conditions, doing so in specified situations would require us to pay a termination fee to Tobira of up $2.0 million. Furthermore, we will have to pay Tobira\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, including all fees and expenses payable to all legal, accounting, financial, public relations and other professional advisors arising out of, in connection with, or related to the Merger, up to a maximum of $250,000 in the aggregate, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.\nAdditionally, these non-solicitation provisions could discourage a potential acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the consideration contemplated by the Merger Agreement or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our company than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf our announced proposed transactions with Tobira contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not successful, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company.\nThere can be no assurance that the previously announced proposed transactions with Tobira will be successful. If no transactions with respect to potential business alternatives are identified and completed, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If our Board of Directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) obligations under our outstanding indebtedness; (ii) obligations under our employment and separation agreements with certain members of its management that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our company, (iii) other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business and (iv) non-cancelable lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our Board of Directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may lose their entire investment in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nRisks Relating to the Combined Company if the Tobira Merger is Completed\nThe integration of Regado and Tobira following the Merger will require significant resources and may not be successful.\nThere is no history of Regado and Tobira as a combined company. Additionally, various decisions regarding management restructuring, operational staffing and reporting systems following the Merger have not yet been finalized. As a result, there can be no guarantee that Regado and Tobira will operate together successfully as a combined company. Integration of the companies and consolidation of their operations will require considerable management time, which could result in the diversion of management resources from other important matters.\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Tobira and Regado in the expected timeframe could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results following the completion of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company following the completion of the Merger to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Regado and Tobira. The continued operation of the two companies will be complex.\nThe failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nusing the combined company\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company;\n\u2022\nappropriately managing the liabilities of the combined company;\n\u2022\npotential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities associated with the Merger and the operations of the combined company;\n\u2022\npotential unknown and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nThe Merger will result in changes to the Tobira and Regado Board of Directors that may affect the combined company\u2019s operations.\nIf the parties complete the Merger, the composition of the Regado Board will change in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Following the completion of the Merger, Regado\u2019s Board will consist of nine members and will be comprised of six representatives of Tobira and three representatives of Regado, with Regado\u2019s current chairman of the board of directors, Dennis Podlesak, continuing to act as chairman of the board of Tobira following the Merger. This new composition of the Board may affect the business strategy and operating decisions of the combined company upon completion of the Merger.\nRegado and Tobira have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger.\nRegado and Tobira have each incurred and will incur additional substantial expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether or not the Merger is completed. These costs include fees for financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, filing fees and financial printing costs. If the Merger is not consummated, each party will be responsible for its own expenses, which are not reimbursable (except in limited circumstances) in the event the Merger does not occur. Upon completion of the Merger, the amount of transaction costs will, in effect, reduce the cash reserves available for the combined enterprise to pursue its plan of business.\nThe operations of Regado and Tobira may be adversely affected by the Merger.\nRegado and Tobira will be subject to various risks following the consummation of the Merger, including:\n\u2022\ninterruption of the operations of the combined companies; and\n\u2022\nanticipated and unanticipated costs relating to additional administrative or operating expenses of each business.\nThese and other factors could adversely affect Tobira\u2019s and Regado\u2019s combined business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nFollowing the termination of the REGULATE-PCI trial, we have terminated development on all of our product candidates, and may not be able to identify any additional product candidates for development in the future.\nWe terminated development on all of our product candidates as part of the Company\u2019s decision to focus resources on three principal activities following the termination of the REGULATE-PCI trial: completion of the final closure of the REGULATE-PCI trial and analysis of the unblinded database from the trial, diligence activities associated with thoroughly exploring potential business alternatives, and the Company\u2019s compliance activities associated with being a public company in good regulatory standing. As a result, we have initiated a process to identify and evaluate potential business alternatives. If this process is not successful in identifying any additional product candidates for development, then we would be unable to generate revenue through product sales and our business would be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights important to our business, as well as successfully defending and enforcing those proprietary rights if challenged. The procurement, defense and enforcement of intellectual property rights involve complex legal and factual questions. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Laws relating to patent rights continue to evolve in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, as does their interpretation by national patent offices and judicial systems, creating some uncertainty for patent applicants, patent owners and licensees.\nOur ability to stop third parties from using our technology or making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. If any patent we currently or in the future may own or license is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our commercial success. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be issued from any patent applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties.\nThe degree of future protection our proprietary rights may afford is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make, use, sell, offer to sell or import products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our patent portfolio;\n\u2022\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies in a manner that does not violate our trade secrets;\n\u2022\nour proprietary rights may not provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional technologies or products that are patentable or suitable to maintain as trade secrets; or\n\u2022\nthe proprietary rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31 2014, we are the owner of record of at least eight issued or allowed U.S. patents and at least seven issued or allowed non-U.S. patents, as well as the licensee of at least ten issued or allowed U.S. patents and at least thirteen issued or allowed non-U.S. patents. We had been actively pursuing at least an additional 10 U.S. patent applications, of which five are provisional and five are non-provisional, at least three international patent applications and at least 38 non-U.S. patent applications in at least twelve jurisdictions as the owner of record, in addition to at least two U.S. patent applications and at least 11 non-U.S. patent applications under license. We do not expect to continue spending money on new patents except in limited situations, and will only spend sufficient funds to maintain existing patents of perceived value.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products or practicing our technology is dependent in part upon the extent to which we have rights in enforceable trade secrets that cover these activities. Trade secret rights can be lost through disclosure to third parties. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to third parties, resulting in loss of trade secret protection. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, which would not constitute a violation of our trade secret rights. Enforcing a claim that a third party is engaged in the unlawful use of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, recognition of rights in trade secrets and a willingness to enforce trade secrets may differ in certain jurisdictions.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe and certain of our directors have been named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit. This lawsuit, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. This lawsuit and any other lawsuits to which we are subject will be costly to defend or pursue and are uncertain in their outcome.\nSecurities class action and derivative litigation has often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs.\nOn February 2, 2015, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a putative class-action lawsuit (captioned Maiman v. Regado Biosciences, Inc., Case No. 10606-CB) in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware, challenging the proposed stock-for-stock Merger of the Company with Tobira. The complaint names as defendants: (i) each member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, (ii) the Company, (iii) Tobira, and (iv) Landmark Merger Sub Inc. Plaintiff alleges that the Company\u2019s directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company\u2019s stockholders by, among other things, (a) agreeing to merge the Company with Tobira for inadequate consideration, (b) implementing a process that was distorted by conflicts of interest, and (c) agreeing to certain provisions of the Merger Agreement that are alleged to favor Tobira and deter alternative bids. Plaintiff also generally alleges that the entity defendants aided and abetted the purported breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors. Plaintiff seeks an injunction against the consummation of the Merger and an award of costs and expenses, including a reasonable allowance for attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. The Company believes the litigation is without merit.\nIt is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. This lawsuit and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of this lawsuit is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of this suit and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with this lawsuit. We currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters, as this lawsuit is currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. We have not established any reserve for any potential liability relating to this lawsuit. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on this action could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position. While the Company has D&O insurance, there is no assurance that the coverage will be sufficient.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:\n\u2022\nthe successful completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe losses we may incur;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and\n\u2022\nlitigation\nIn addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who beneficially owned more than 5% of our common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 60% of our common stock as estimated as of December 31, 2014. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, will control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nclassifying our board of directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d convertible preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring a supermajority vote of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nestablishing Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction for certain stockholder litigation against us\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nYou may be diluted by exercises of outstanding options and warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 3,839,122 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $4.68 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,356 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $12.02 per share. The exercise of such outstanding options and warrants will result in dilution of your investment. In addition, as described below, you may experience additional dilution if we issue common stock in the future. As a result of this dilution, you may receive significantly less than the full purchase price you paid for the shares in the event of liquidation.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock may lose value and our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements, we may be notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance. Our common stock has recently closed below $1.00 per share and on December 22nd the Company received a deficiency letter from the NASDAQ, indicating that, based on the Company\u2019s closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company did not comply with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share. We regained compliance following the announcement of our Merger Agreement with Tobira because our common stock traded above $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days during the 180 days following notice of non-compliance. There can be no assurance that the per share trading price of our common stock will remain above $1.00 per share or that we will be able to continue to meet other listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected, our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock could be limited and we may fail to meet all conditions required to close our pending Merger with Tobira. In addition, our common stock could be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutional investor interest.\nWe are incurring significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company and such costs are likely to increase particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are required to comply with certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and NASDAQ , our stock exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nUnder the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and will be able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Our Loan Agreement with Comerica Bank prohibits us from paying cash dividends. As a result, the only return to stockholders will be appreciation in the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be volatile in the future, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 14101, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TBRA"}
