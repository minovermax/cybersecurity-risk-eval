RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the adverse developments described in the following risk factors could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nOur ability to curtail our losses and reach profitability is unproven, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe recorded a net loss of $87.1 million in 2014. With the exception of 2013, which was positively impacted by a significant legal settlement with Valeant, we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including a net loss of approximately $56.1 million for 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $217.6 million. Historically, we have allocated most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical development activities and clinical trials. While Sandoz is responsible for selling, marketing, distribution, general and administrative costs and costs related to the commercialization of KERYDIN under the Sandoz Agreement, we expect that, as a general matter, both sales and marketing and research and development expenses for our product candidates will increase in the future as we progress such product candidates through clinical development into the commercialization stage, conduct our research and development activities under our various current and potential collaborations, including those related to our neglected diseases initiatives, advance our discovery research projects into the preclinical stage and continue our early-stage research. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to experience net losses and negative cash flows in 2015, and we cannot guarantee that payments under the Sandoz Agreement will be sufficient to offset losses in future years. These losses and negative cash flows have had, and unless we become profitable, will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of our expenses or when, or if, we will be able to attain or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase if we are required by the FDA to perform studies in addition to, or that are larger than, those that we currently expect. Whether we continue to incur future net losses will depend, in part, on our future expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Revenues from the Sandoz Agreement will depend in large part on the successful commercialization of KERYDIN. Prior to our entry into the Sandoz Agreement, we financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, debt arrangements, government contracts and grants and payments under our collaborations and research agreements with GSK, Lilly, the Gates Foundation and DTRA and our legal settlement with Valeant. Revenues from such collaborations and research agreements are uncertain because milestones or other contingent payments under them may not be achieved or received. In addition, we may not be able to enter into other collaborations that will generate significant cash. If we are unable to successfully develop our product candidates, or if revenues from any product candidate that receives marketing approval, including KERYDIN, are insufficient, we will not achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur operations to date have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and we are reliant on collaborators for certain of our products. In particular, under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States. Consequently, any predictions regarding our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or greater control. Our financial condition and operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following risk factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 our ability to timely obtain and maintain regulatory approval for AN2728 or any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products, including Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product that was approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014;\n\u2022 our dependency on third party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our products;\n\u2022 our ability to establish an effective sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure in a timely manner;\n\u2022 market acceptance of KERYDIN or our product candidates;\n\u2022 delays in the commencement, enrollment and timing of clinical testing for our product candidates, including our Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis;\n\u2022 the success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022 any delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022 potential side effects that could delay or prevent approval and commercialization of product candidates or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;\n\u2022 the ability of patients or healthcare providers to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates;\n\u2022 our ability to receive approval for and commercialize KERYDIN or our product candidates outside of the United States;\n\u2022 our ability to establish or maintain collaboration, licensing or other arrangements;\n\u2022 our ability and the ability of third parties to protect and defend intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 costs related to and outcomes from potential litigation;\n\u2022 our ability to adequately support future growth;\n\u2022 our ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain our accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022 potential product liability claims;\n\u2022 potential liabilities associated with hazardous materials; and\n\u2022 our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of future operating performance.\nWe may continue to require substantial additional capital and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs.\nThe development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is expensive. The costs include those associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, interactions with regulatory authorities and the expenses associated with product commercialization. If, for example, the FDA requires that we perform additional studies beyond those that we currently expect, our expenses could increase materially beyond what we currently anticipate and the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed. Although we believe that our existing capital resources, together with the payments we expect to receive based on sales of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development activities, including clinical trials for our development programs and preclinical activities for our product candidates, and meet our operating requirements beyond the next twelve months. Furthermore, any delays in, or unanticipated costs associated with, our development, regulatory and commercial efforts could significantly increase the amount of additional capital required for us to conduct these research, development and commercialization activities and meet our operating requirements beyond the next twelve months. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results, including the costs to maintain our currently planned operations, could vary materially.\nUnless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, including sales of KERYDIN under the Sandoz Agreement, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or licensing, collaboration or other similar arrangements, or a combination of these sources. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts and may not be able to make scheduled debt payments on a timely basis or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock (such as the Convertible Senior Notes), our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and the granting of security interests over our assets. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nOur forecasts regarding the period of time that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, the timing of our future capital resource requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the effects of competing technological and market developments, including Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product that was approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities;\n\u2022 the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022 the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates, including the Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728;\n\u2022 the success of our collaborations and research agreements and the attainment of milestones and royalty payments, if any, under those agreements;\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022 the terms and timing of any future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, we could incur additional indebtedness that could have adverse effects on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $90.5 million, which was comprised of the Convertible Senior Notes issued by us in October 2014. Our ability to pay interest on, repay or refinance our indebtedness, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our indebtedness, fund our research and development activities and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, refinancing indebtedness, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or to engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with financing acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. Any increase in our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to satisfy our debt obligations and could have other important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or greater cash flow; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, product development programs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests and may require the granting of security interests over our assets. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, potential foreclosure on our assets and other adverse results.\nRisks Relating to the Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Our Product and Product Candidates\nIf KERYDIN fails to timely achieve and sustain commercial success, our business will suffer, our future prospects may be harmed and our stock price would likely decline.\nKERYDIN is our first product to be approved by the FDA and is our first commercialized product. Unless and until we successfully commercialize another product candidate or obtain approval to market KERYDIN, directly or through a collaboration, in jurisdictions outside of the United States, the payments that we receive under the Sandoz Agreement will constitute the entirety of our revenues from product sales. The amount of such payments will depend largely on the commercial success of KERYDIN, which will determine the level of gross profit sharing payments, if any, in excess of any minimum amounts that we are entitled to under the Sandoz Agreement. In addition, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. We have limited ability to control such decisions, which may affect the commercial success of KERYDIN. The commercial success of KERYDIN will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 acceptance of and ongoing satisfaction with KERYDIN by the medical community, patients receiving treatment and third party payors in the United States, and eventually in foreign markets to the extent we seek and receive marketing approvals abroad;\n\u2022 KERYDIN's market share;\n\u2022 the extent and effectiveness of the development, sales and marketing and distribution support KERYDIN receives from Sandoz;\n\u2022 the amount of resources utilized and efforts made by Sandoz in relation to the commercialization of KERYDIN;\n\u2022 the existence of competing products, including whether Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product that was approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014, or other competing products or therapies, are prescribed instead of KERYDIN for certain patients or are perceived as superior to, or more cost-effective than, KERYDIN by physicians or patients;\n\u2022 adequate coverage or reimbursement for KERYDIN by government healthcare programs and third party payors, including private health coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations; and\n\u2022 the ability of patients to afford any required co-payments for KERYDIN.\nAs discussed above, we have limited ability under the Sandoz Agreement to control decisions that may affect the commercial success of KERYDIN. If Sandoz is unable to successfully commercialize KERYDIN, our revenues would be impacted and our business would be seriously harmed.\nWe cannot be certain that AN2728 or any of our other wholly-owned or partnered product candidates will receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval our product candidates will not be able to be marketed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our most advanced product candidates. Our ability to generate significant revenue related to product sales will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nCurrently, our lead product candidate is AN2728, an investigational non-steroidal topical PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. We initiated Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adults in the first quarter of 2014. We may conduct lengthy and expensive Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 only to learn that this drug candidate is not a safe or effective treatment, in which case these clinical trials may not lead to regulatory approval. Similarly, GSK's development of our partnered product candidate in TB and Lilly's development program for our partnered animal health product candidate may be subject to delays in development and not lead to regulatory approval from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies. Such failure to timely develop and obtain regulatory approvals would prevent our product candidates from being marketed and would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe development of a product candidate, including preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, quality systems, labeling, approval, record-keeping, selling, promotion, marketing and distribution of products, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate's safety and effectiveness for each indication. The approval application must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. The regulatory development and review process typically takes years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. If a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be used, include extensive warnings on the product labeling or require costly ongoing requirements for post-marketing clinical studies and surveillance or other risk management measures to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product candidate. Markets outside of the United States also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. If AN2728 or any of our other wholly-owned or partnered product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations. Moreover, our submission of an NDA or our receipt of regulatory approval with respect to any product does not assure the commercial success of such product.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials could increase our product development costs or limit the regulatory approval of our product candidates. We initiated\nPhase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adults in the first quarter of 2014. Our future clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin when expected or, if commenced, be completed on schedule or at all. The commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\"CROs\") and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 regulatory objections to commencing a clinical trial;\n\u2022 our inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates;\n\u2022 the withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 our inability to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at prospective sites;\n\u2022 difficulty recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including meeting the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our product candidates; and\n\u2022 our inability to retain patients in clinical trials due to the treatment protocol, personal issues, side effects from the therapy or lack of efficacy, particularly for those patients receiving either a vehicle without the active ingredient or a placebo.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our current or any future partners, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022 a failed inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety or efficacy issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u2022 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs resulting from enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies, increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties or other reasons.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those currently contemplated, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for such product candidates.\nIn addition, if our current or any future partners assume development of our product candidates, they may suspend or terminate their development and commercialization efforts, including clinical trials for our product candidates, at any time. For example, in September 2013, Lilly notified us that it was ceasing further development of a compound it licensed in August 2011 for an animal health indication and has granted us a fully paid, sublicenseable, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive license to the related technology and patents. Similarly, GSK discontinued clinical development of AN3365 in October 2012 and all rights to AN3365 have reverted to us.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we or our partners may be required by appropriate regulatory authorities to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes.\nAmendments may require us or our partners to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we or our partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or our partners terminate clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be prevented or delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials ultimately may lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate that we or our current or potential future partners advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. In addition, data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a product candidate. Frequently, product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials, including, for example, failures to demonstrate statistically significant results supporting the efficacy of such product candidates. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. Further, clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If AN2728, AN5568 (also referred to as SCYX-7158) for HAT, or our other product candidates are found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we or our collaborators will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for them and our business could be harmed. For example, we are conducting standard cardiac safety monitoring in our Phase 3 pivotal studies for AN2728. If the results of Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoints and demonstrate an acceptable safety level, the prospects for approval of AN2728 would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 pivotal studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen, particularly for self-administered topical drugs, and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials we or any partners may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe have limited experience in conducting Phase 3 clinical studies and we may be unable to submit NDAs for AN2728 and other product candidates we are developing.\nWe initiated our Phase 3 pivotal studies of AN2728 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in March 2014. The proper conduct of Phase 3 pivotal studies is essential in obtaining regulatory approval and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process. Although our NDA for KERYDIN was accepted for filing by the FDA in September 2013 and approved by the FDA\nin July 2014, we have limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete additional planned clinical studies in a way that leads to an NDA submission, acceptance and approval of AN2728 or any of our other product candidates under development. We did not file an SPA with the FDA with respect to our AN2728 Phase 3 pivotal studies in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. We may require more time and incur greater costs than our competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of products that we develop. In addition, failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical studies may prevent us from or delay us in commercializing AN2728 and our other product candidates under development.\nIf KERYDIN or any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that are generated from their sales will be limited.\nThe commercial success of KERYDIN and our product candidates such as AN2728, if approved, depends upon the acceptance of these products among physicians, patients and healthcare payors. The degree of market acceptance of our approved products may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 limitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our products;\n\u2022 changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any of our products;\n\u2022 limitations in the approved indications for our products;\n\u2022 lower demonstrated clinical safety or efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022 occurrence of significant adverse side effects;\n\u2022 ineffective sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022 lack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors;\n\u2022 timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products, including information provided in competitor products' package inserts;\n\u2022 lack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022 availability of alternative therapies with potentially advantageous results, or other products with similar results at similar or lower cost, including generics and over-the-counter products;\n\u2022 adverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022 lack of convenience and ease of administration of our products; and\n\u2022 potential product liability claims.\nIf our approved products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, sufficient revenue may not be generated from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and healthcare payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful. We cannot be certain that KERYDIN will achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, healthcare payors and patients. Additionally, our product candidates intended for use against neglected diseases, such as AN5568 for HAT and our product candidate for TB, are not expected to generate significant revenues, if any.\nUndesirable side effects may delay or prevent marketing approval of our product candidates, require that our approved products be taken off the market or otherwise limit the sales of our approved products.\nUnforeseen side effects may arise during clinical development or after an approved product has been marketed. For example, during our clinical trials for KERYDIN, a small number of patients being treated for onychomycosis experienced some skin irritation around their toenails. In addition, a small number of patients who received AN2728 during our clinical trials experienced some skin irritation. The range and potential severity of possible side effects from systemic therapies is generally greater than for topically administered drugs. The results of future clinical trials may show that our product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nIf undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by our product are identified after such product receives marketing approval:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require changes to the label, including the inclusion of specific warnings or contraindications, and may issue field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 we or contractual partners may be subject to limitations on how the product may be promoted;\n\u2022 sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require us to take our approved product off the market;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our current or potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.\nAll of our product candidates require regulatory review and approval prior to commercialization. Any delay in the regulatory review or approval of any of our product candidates will harm our business.\nAll of our product candidates require regulatory review and approval prior to commercialization. Any delays in the regulatory review or approval of our product candidates would delay market launch, increase our cash requirements and result in additional operating losses.\nRegulatory agencies are establishing increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign approvals, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Furthermore, this approval process is extremely complex, expensive and uncertain. We or our current or potential future partners may be unable to successfully submit NDAs in the United States or marketing approval applications or other foreign applications for any of our products. Upon submitting an NDA, including any amendments or supplements to the NDA, to the FDA seeking marketing approval for any of our product candidates, the FDA must decide whether to either accept or reject the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that these submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA, or that any marketing approval application submissions to any other regulatory authorities will be accepted for filing and review by those authorities. We cannot be certain that we or our partners will be able to respond to any regulatory requests during the review period in a timely manner without delaying potential regulatory action. We also cannot be certain that\nany of our product candidates will receive favorable recommendations from any FDA advisory committee or foreign regulatory bodies or be approved for marketing by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications may be based upon many factors, including regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data and studies, regulatory questions regarding data and results, recommendations made in regulatory advice letters, changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the emergence of new information regarding our product candidates or other products. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries may result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities.\nData obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to different interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory review or approval of any of our product candidates. For example, if preclinical results suggest a potential for drug-drug interactions (\"DDI\"), clinical trials are generally conducted to assess the likelihood of DDI and their potential impact on product safety. Although, to date, we have not been requested to perform DDI studies by the FDA, we nevertheless completed a healthy-volunteer DDI clinical study in February 2014 demonstrating that AN2728 and its metabolites do not interact with cytochrome P450 subtype 2C9. However, if any DDI studies are required, it may delay any potential product approval and may increase the expenses associated with clinical programs. Furthermore, regulatory attitudes towards the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, policy changes and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We do not know whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nIn addition, the environment in which our regulatory submissions may be reviewed changes over time. For example, average review times at the FDA for NDAs have fluctuated over the last ten years, and we cannot predict the review time for any of our submissions with any regulatory authorities. Review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Moreover, in light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accounting Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense, a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nOur use of boron chemistry to develop pharmaceutical product candidates is novel and may not prove successful in producing additional approved products. Undesirable side effects of any of our product candidates, or of boron-based drugs developed by others, may extend the time period required to obtain regulatory approval or harm market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved.\nAll of our product development activities are centered on compounds containing boron. The use of boron chemistry to develop new drugs is largely unproven. If boron-based compounds developed by us or others have significant adverse side effects, regulatory authorities could require additional studies of our boron-based compounds, which could delay the timing of and increase the cost for regulatory approvals of our product candidates. Additionally, adverse side effects for other boron-based compounds could affect the willingness of healthcare payors and medical providers to provide reimbursement for or use our boron-based drugs and could impact market acceptance of our products.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that boron-based products will be free of significant adverse side effects. During clinical trials, a small number of patients who received KERYDIN experienced some skin irritation around their toenails and a few patients who received AN2728 experienced some skin irritation in the treated areas. If boron-based drug treatments result in significant adverse side effects, they may not be useful as therapeutic agents. If we are unable to develop products that are safe and effective using our boron chemistry platform, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective commercial infrastructure or enter into acceptable third party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates successfully.\nThe marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products in specific U.S. specialty markets require a commercial infrastructure and the implementation of such infrastructure requires substantial resources and time. Historically, we have not had any sales, distribution or marketing capabilities. Under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States. However, to the extent we are successful in our clinical trials and are able to gain approval for AN2728 or our other product candidates, we intend to continue to evaluate how best to commercialize our products, whether through the establishment of our own internal infrastructure, partnerships with third party organizations or a combination of both. The costs of any such internal structure in advance of any approval of our product candidates could be significant. In addition to the risk and expense of establishing sales capabilities in advance of commercial launch, we may not be able to hire a commercial organization that has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. If we are unable to establish a sales force and marketing capability, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, we continue to evaluate entering into sales and marketing or licensing arrangements with third parties in the United States and for the international sales of any approved products. If we are unable to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to market and sell our products in these markets and the potential product revenues for our products would be reduced.\nKERYDIN has and will continue to face competition, as will our future approved products, if any, and most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our approved product KERYDIN and our future approved products, if any, will compete with products marketed by numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large fully-integrated companies, with financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, legal, regulatory and product development resources substantially greater than ours. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain regulatory- or intellectual property-based exclusivity that limits our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors also may develop drugs that are more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours and also may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. The ability of KERYDIN and our future approved products, if any, to compete with products sold by other companies will depend on a number of factors, including product efficacy, safety, price and convenience. For example, KERYDIN competes with Jublia, Valeant's efinaconazole product that was approved by the FDA for the treatment for onychomycosis of the toenails in the United States in June 2014, and we cannot be certain of the level of acceptance that KERYDIN will receive among physicians, healthcare payors and patients as compared to Jublia.\nThe dermatology and podiatry markets are competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nKERYDIN has faced, and we believe will continue to face, competition from Jublia, as well as other currently marketed nail fungal therapeutics, including Penlac, Lamisil, Sporanox, Onmel and generic versions of those compounds. KERYDIN also competes with lasers, which have received clearance from the FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis, over-the-counter products and debridement. There are also several pharmaceutical product candidates under development that could potentially be used to treat onychomycosis and compete with KERYDIN. For example, in the third quarter of 2014, Topica Pharmaceuticals, Inc. completed a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of 10% Luliconazole Solution to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Viamet Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral VT-1161. In addition, several companies are pursuing various devices for onychomycosis, including laser technology. Similarly, if AN2728 is approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, we anticipate that it would compete against a number of approved treatments, including topical corticosteroids, such as Clobex (clobetasol propionate) and Locoid (hydrocortisone butyrate), and topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as Elidel (pimecrolimus) and Protopic (tacrolimus), antibiotics and antihistamines. AN2728 may one day also compete against: (i) current systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis, which include corticosteroids (primarily prednisone), cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil, and (ii) treatments for atopic dermatitis in development, which include dupilumab, ixekizumab, Toctino (oral alitretinoin), Otezla (apremilast), Xeljanz (tofacitinib) and WBI-1001/GSK2894512. In addition, each of our product candidates may compete against product candidates currently under development by other companies.\nEven if a generic product or an over-the-counter product is less effective than our product, a less effective generic or over-the-counter product may be more quickly adopted by health insurers and patients than our competing product based upon cost or convenience.\nReimbursement decisions by healthcare payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient reimbursement for our products, including KERYDIN, it is less likely that our products will be widely used.\nSuccessful commercialization of pharmaceutical products usually depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors at the federal, state and private levels. Patients or healthcare providers who purchase drugs generally rely on healthcare payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with such products. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors, such as HMOs and insurance companies, can be essential to new product acceptance.\nReimbursement decisions by healthcare payors may have an effect on pricing and market acceptance. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. Consequently, we have limited ability to influence such decisions with respect to KERYDIN. We can give no assurance as to the extent to which KERYDIN will be reimbursed in any future periods. Our product candidates, such as AN2728, also will be subject to uncertain reimbursement decisions by healthcare payors. Our products are less likely to be used if they do not receive adequate reimbursement.\nThe market for our products and product candidates may depend on access to healthcare payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which healthcare payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Industry competition to be included in such formularies results in downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Healthcare payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies when a competing generic product is available.\nAll healthcare payors, whether governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medicines exists among all these payors. Therefore, coverage of and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payor to payor and can be difficult and costly to obtain.\nVirtually all countries regulate or set the prices of pharmaceutical products, which is a separate determination from whether a particular product will be subject to reimbursement under that government's health plans. There are systems for reimbursement and pricing approval in each country and moving a product through those systems is time consuming and expensive.\nHealthcare policy changes, including the Healthcare Reform Act, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Healthcare Reform Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. We anticipate that a portion of our future revenue, including through gross profit sharing payments that we may receive under the Sandoz Agreement, will be derived from United States government healthcare programs, including Medicare. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Act imposes a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \"branded prescription drugs,\" which includes innovator drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs or generics) to U.S. government programs. The Healthcare Reform Act and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects.\nIn addition to the Healthcare Reform Act, we expect that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and healthcare payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for any products that are approved or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or healthcare payors or may increase the tax requirements for life sciences companies such as ours. While it is difficult to predict what effect the Healthcare Reform Act or any future legislation or regulation will have on us, such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe currently expect that a portion of the market for our products will be outside the United States. Our products approved in the United States and product candidates may never receive approval or be commercialized outside of the United States.\nWe may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales of approved products. To market and commercialize any products outside of the United States, we or any third parties that are marketing or selling our products must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed in these risk factors regarding failure to obtain FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks such as those relating to the pricing of any such product, which will likely require negotiations with foreign governments or agencies of such governments prior to commercialization in these countries. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory\nprocess in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. In addition, regulatory approval often involves further efforts to obtain adequate pricing or reimbursement from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, regulatory risks include the possibility that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested, or at all, which could limit the uses of our approved products and have an adverse effect on our product sales and potential royalties.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for any of our product candidates, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. Given the number of high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, regulatory authorities may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. For example, any labeling approved for any of our products may include a restriction on the term of its use, or it may not include one or more of our intended indications. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance with any new post-approval regulatory requirements. Any of these restrictions or requirements could force us or our partners to conduct costly studies.\nOur approved products will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information on the drug. Furthermore, any post-approval changes that we may seek to make to an approved NDA, including KERYDIN's NDA, such as a change in the manufacturing site, manufacturing process, drug specifications, drug container, drug packaging or labeling, are subject to varying degrees of FDA review depending on the categorization of the change as a \"major change,\" \"moderate change\" or \"minor change.\" Any such proposed change may not be accepted or approved by the FDA, and failure to obtain such acceptance or approval may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers' facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We also will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If any of our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters;\n\u2022 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022 require us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, our partners or our potential future partners;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn addition, the occurrence of any of the foregoing, even if promptly remedied, could negatively impact the perception of us or the relevant product among the medical community, patients or third party payors.\nPharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. After approval, such products are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. We and others (including regulatory agencies and private payors) collect extensive information, and may conduct post-marketing clinical studies, on the efficacy and safety of our products following approval. New safety or efficacy data from these sources may result in product label changes that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in reduced sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after approval could result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market, as well as product liability claims.\nWe currently are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \"kickbacks\" and false or fraudulent claims, and federal and state physician payment disclosure laws that, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies, as well as governmental authorities in those foreign countries in which we may commercialize our products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, import, export, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion. These statutes and regulations include Anti-Kickback statutes and false claims statutes.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting identified common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.\nRecently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing of the product for unapproved and, thus, non-reimbursable, uses. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare fraud. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a company's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Federal \"sunshine\" laws require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, including requiring applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure requirements regarding payments and any other \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to prescribers, physicians, teaching hospitals and other health care providers. Several states have similar healthcare professional aggregate spend reporting obligations or prohibitions that require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and prohibit or require reporting of the provision of gifts, meals and entertainment to individual healthcare providers. Other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, California requires pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. We have adopted a comprehensive compliance program that we believe satisfies the California law. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPromotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product's approved label. The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (\"OPDP\"), formerly the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications, is responsible for reviewing prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in these materials is not false or misleading. There are specific disclosure requirements and the applicable regulations mandate that advertisements cannot be false or misleading or omit material facts about the product. Prescription drug promotional materials must present a fair balance between the drug's effectiveness and the risks associated with its use. Most warning letters from OPDP cite inadequate disclosure of risk information.\nIn addition, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. If a regulatory agency disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, it may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market.\nIn addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal false claims laws, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. State and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nWhile Sandoz is responsible for sales and marketing activities associated with the commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States, we may in the future employ, or contract with a contract sales organization that employs, the sales representatives who promote our drug products. We expect that government and regulatory agencies will hold us responsible for any actions by such sales representatives or sales organizations. If we or our contract sales organization fails to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable United States and foreign regulatory authorities or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we and our partners could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nIf we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under United States federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to profitably sell any products that we may develop.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nIn 2010, PPACA became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, significantly affecting the\npharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022 an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022 extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022 new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in PPACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers and other healthcare providers, and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;\n\u2022 a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u2022 expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u2022 a new Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board empowered to recommend cost reduction policies under certain circumstances.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals,\nimaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nWe anticipate that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Insurers may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third party payors will reimburse for any newly-approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nWe also cannot be certain that KERYDIN or any of our product candidates approved in the future will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies, nor can we predict the negotiated price for such products, which will be determined by market factors. Many states have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If KERYDIN or other products that may result from our product candidates are not included on these preferred drug lists, physicians may not be inclined to prescribe them to their patients, thereby diminishing the potential market for such products. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales, marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. Consequently, we have limited ability to influence such decisions with respect to KERYDIN.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations may affect the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies may issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us, our partners or our potential future partners and our products or product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. These various sorts of recommendations may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related or competing therapies. Changes to these recommendations or other guidelines advocating alternative therapies could result in decreased use of our products, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on Sandoz for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States, and our ability to generate revenues from KERYDIN will depend on sales of this product by Sandoz in the United States.\nUnless and until we obtain approval to market KERYDIN, directly or through a collaboration, in jurisdictions outside of the United States, our ability to generate revenue from KERYDIN will depend on payments that we receive from Sandoz under the Sandoz Agreement. Under the Sandoz Agreement, we are entitled to, among other things, 50% of the gross profits (defined as net sales less cost of goods sold) accrued by Sandoz on sales of KERYDIN, except that in 2015 we start receiving gross profit sharing payments only after the first $50.0 million of gross profits have been accrued by Sandoz. The gross profit sharing arrangement entitles us to cumulative minimum gross profit sharing payments of $45.0 million for 2016. We are not entitled to cumulative minimum gross profit sharing payments for any other year under the Sandoz Agreement. The level of gross profit sharing payments, if any, in excess of any minimum amounts that we are entitled to under the Sandoz Agreement will depend on\nthe level of commercial success that KERYDIN achieves. Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States and controls sales (including setting the price for KERYDIN), marketing and other commercialization matters under the Sandoz Agreement, including pricing and reimbursement matters. We have limited ability to control such decisions, which may affect the commercial success of KERYDIN. If Sandoz does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of KERYDIN, is ineffective in doing so or is otherwise unable to successfully commercialize KERYDIN, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, Sandoz may terminate the Sandoz Agreement for convenience upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to the payment to us (to the extent then unpaid) of the launch payment and any minimum gross profit sharing amounts. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Sandoz will continue to distribute and commercialize KERYDIN through the full initial term of the Sandoz Agreement (or any renewal term thereof).\nWe have limited experience manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients and products or product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale, and have no manufacturing facility. As a result, we are dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our products and product candidates and our supply chain. If we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of our products, including KERYDIN, or product candidates could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of KERYDIN. We have only a small number of personnel with experience in drug product manufacturing. Pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with Hovione, we are obligated during the term of the agreement to purchase from Hovione a portion of our API requirements for KERYDIN intended for distribution in the United States. In addition, pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with DPT, we outsource to DPT the manufacturing and packaging of KERYDIN finished drug product. Any inability by our third party manufacturers to supply sufficient quantities of KERYDIN API or finished drug product could adversely affect product commercialization and delay certain payments under the Sandoz Agreement. In addition, we currently outsource all API and finished drug product manufacturing and packaging for our clinical product candidates such as AN2728 to third parties and intend to continue to do so. We may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. We currently rely on Hovione and DPT for our requirements of API and finished drug product for KERYDIN, respectively. In the event that we and our suppliers are unable to agree to terms and conditions for the supply of some or all of our clinical and commercial supply needs of API and finished drug product, our suppliers terminate our agreements or we are unable to renew or continue on terms acceptable to us, or at all, existing agreements with such suppliers following the expiration of their terms, we would not be able to manufacture API and finished drug product until alternative suppliers are identified and qualified. This inability to manufacture could delay the further development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our products and, in the case of KERYDIN, delay certain payments under the Sandoz Agreement. For example, the initial term of our manufacturing agreement with Hovione expires on December 31, 2020, subject to customary early termination rights. In addition, prior to January 31, 2018, Hovione may give notice to us of its intent to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2018 in the event that we do not make aggregate purchases of API for KERYDIN from Hovione in excess of a specified minimum amount. Similarly, the initial term of our manufacturing agreement with DPT currently expires on December 31, 2019, subject to customary early termination rights. We may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for our products. Such suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering manufacturing, testing, quality control, distribution and record keeping relating to our products and product candidates, as well as for products and product candidates owned by other companies. These suppliers are also subject to ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our product or product candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements.\nReliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured a product or product candidate ourselves, including:\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022 the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities;\n\u2022 the potential that such third parties will encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance, which could result in their inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of drugs to meet commercial needs or clinical supplies of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022 the potential failure by such third parties to establish and follow FDA-mandated cGMPs or the failure to document their adherence to cGMPs, either of which could require costly recalls of products already having received approval, lead to significant delays in the availability of material for commercial or clinical study needs or delay or prevent marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022 the potential failure by such third parties to consistently produce quality batches of the product in accordance with the current manufacturing process. If modifications are required to the manufacturing processes or facilities, approval of a new or supplemental NDA may be required; and\n\u2022 the potential that such third parties may encounter financial difficulties that would interfere with their obligations to supply our products and product candidates.\nIn addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers, including Hovione, are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our products or product candidates or their components into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency import inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging.\nAny of these factors could result in significant delays or higher costs in connection with our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or the commercialization of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our existing third party collaborations and research agreements to fund all or a portion of certain of our development opportunities and expect to continue to expend resources in our current collaborations and/or research agreements. These research collaborations may fail to successfully identify product candidates, may result in disputes or our partners may elect not to license, develop or commercialize any of the resulting compounds. In the event that any collaborator of ours does not elect to exercise its option or elects not to develop or commercialize our collaboration product candidates, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrently, we have two significant ongoing collaboration and research agreements: a research collaboration with the Gates Foundation to discover drug candidates intended to treat two filarial worm diseases (onchocerciasis, or river blindness, and lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis), TB and a parasitic disease (cryptosporidiosis), and a research agreement with DTRA to design and discover new classes of systemic antibiotics. In addition, while the research period under the GSK Agreement has expired, GSK selected a compound for further development in TB in September 2013, subsequently selected a number of back-up compounds and is responsible for all further development and commercialization with respect thereto. Similarly, while the research term under the Lilly Agreement ended in April 2014, Lilly licensed a development compound for an animal health\nindication from us in December 2012 and will be responsible for all further development and commercialization of this compound.\nDuring the research terms of the collaborations and research agreements, we and, in some cases, our partner are committed to use our diligent efforts to discover and develop compounds and to provide specified resources, on a project-by-project basis. We are either reimbursed for our research costs, or each party is responsible for its own research costs, but in all cases we expect to continue to expend resources on the collaborations and research agreements. If we fail to successfully identify product candidates or, in some cases, demonstrate proof-of-concept for those product candidates we identify, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In the case of the DTRA award, after the initial term of eleven months and the current twelve-month research extension, DTRA has the sole option to fund the research for a subsequent nineteen-month period. DTRA may not exercise the option to fund the nineteen-month research extension. In addition, we may mutually agree with our collaboration partner not to pursue all of the research activities contemplated under the applicable agreement. Certain collaboration partners have the option, but are not required, to exclusively license or select for further development certain product candidates under the agreement once the product candidate meets specified criteria, subject to continuing obligations to make milestone payments and royalty payments on commercial sales, if any, of such licensed compounds. Certain collaboration partners are obligated to make payments to us upon the achievement of certain initial discovery and developmental milestones, but further, more significant milestone payments are payable only on compounds that the partner chooses to license or develop. If we devote significant resources to a research project and our collaboration partner elects not to exercise its option with respect to any resulting product candidates or elects not to develop such candidates, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In certain cases, if our partner does not exercise a given option or terminates development, we may request a license to develop and commercialize products containing the relevant compounds. If we make such a request, we will be obligated to make certain milestone and royalty payments to the partner upon development and commercialization of such products.\nIf our collaboration partner elects to license or develop a compound, like GSK and Lilly have, the partner assumes sole responsibility for further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of such compound. Thus, with respect to compounds that our partner chooses to develop, the timing of development and future payments to us, including milestone and royalty payments, will depend on the extent to which such licensed compounds advance through development, regulatory approval and commercialization by our partner. Additionally, our partner can choose to terminate the agreement with a specified notice period or its license to any compounds at any time with no further obligation to develop and commercialize such compounds. In such event, we would not be eligible to receive further payments for the affected compounds. We would retain rights to develop and market any such product candidates. However, we would be required to fund further development and commercialization ourselves or with other partners if we continue to pursue these product candidates and, in some cases, would owe our previous partner royalties if we succeeded in commercializing any such product candidates. For example, in September 2013, Lilly notified us that it was ceasing further development of the compound licensed in August 2011 for an animal health indication. There can be no assurance that our partners will not terminate development candidates remaining under license in our existing collaboration agreements.\nIf our partner does not devote sufficient resources to the research, development and commercialization of compounds identified through our research collaboration, or is ineffective in doing so, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, if our partner independently develops products that compete with our compounds, it could elect to advance such products and not develop or commercialize our product candidates, even while complying with applicable exclusivity provisions. Our collaboration partners may not fulfill their obligations under the\nagreements or develop and commercialize compounds identified by the research collaborations. If our partners fail to fulfill their obligations under the agreements or terminate the agreements, we may need to obtain the capital necessary to fund the development and commercialization of the returned compounds, enter into alternative arrangements with a third party or halt our development efforts in these areas. We also could become involved in disputes with our partners, which could lead to delays in or termination of the research collaborations or the development and commercialization of identified product candidates and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. For example, we settled in October 2013 our breach of contract dispute and all related existing and future claims with Valeant who paid us $142.5 million following an expensive and time-consuming litigation process. We may have other disputes in the future with our current or future partners with respect to our collaboration agreements. If our partners terminate or breach their agreements with us or otherwise do not advance the compounds identified by our research collaborations, our chances of successfully developing or commercializing such compounds could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop certain of our product candidates and our financial condition and operating results.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive. Consequently, we routinely evaluate the establishment of collaborations for development and commercialization of product candidates and research programs. For example, in July 2014, we entered into the Sandoz Agreement, pursuant to which PharmaDerm, the branded dermatology division of Sandoz, distributes and commercializes KERYDIN in the United States. In addition, to the extent we are successful in our clinical trials and are able to gain approval for AN2728 or our other product candidates, we will evaluate how best to commercialize such products, whether through the establishment of our own internal infrastructure, partnerships with third party organizations or a combination of both. In addition, we may enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales of approved products. If we are unable to enter into any such arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to market and sell our products in these markets. We expect to face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements such as our arrangement with Sandoz are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our product candidates. When we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product or product candidate, we can expect to relinquish to the third party some or all of the control over the future success of that product or product candidate. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our products or product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the commercialization and development of our products or product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators for our products or product candidates, we may incur increased costs, we may be forced to limit the number of products or product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them and we might fail to commercialize products or programs or territories for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on third party contractors for a substantial portion of our operations and may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions ourselves.\nWe outsource substantial portions of our operations to third party service providers, including chemical synthesis, biological screening and manufacturing and the conduct of our clinical trials and various preclinical studies, as well as certain medical affairs activities. In addition, under the Sandoz Agreement, Sandoz is responsible for the distribution and commercialization of KERYDIN in the United States, as well as certain governmental reporting obligations associated therewith.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, unless and until we establish our own internal infrastructure, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner, may become troubled financially or may fail to perform at all. If these third party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to provide us with timely and accurate information or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, it could impact our ability to comply with applicable state and federal laws, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business. In addition, our agreements with contract research organizations and other third parties with which we do business often contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we typically agree to indemnify the party against certain types of third party claims. To the extent that we are subject to a claim under such an indemnification provision, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The use of third party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. There are a limited number of third party service providers that have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third party service providers can be difficult and time consuming and could cause delays in our development programs. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify, retain and successfully manage the performance of third party service providers in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose our relationships with contract research organizations, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe are substantially dependent on third party vendors and contract research organizations for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug discovery and development efforts. If we lose our relationship with any one or more of these providers, we could experience a significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its services, which could adversely affect our development efforts. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that such a provider will need additional time to respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. In addition, any contract research organization that we retain will be subject to the FDA's regulatory requirements and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not adhered to by these providers, the commercialization and development of our products or product candidates could be delayed, which could severely harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection covering our products and product candidates, as well as our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property against third party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have regulatory exclusivity or intellectual property based exclusivity rights under valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property that cover our products. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products, using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions, and the legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of pharmaceutical patents are evolving. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that we currently own or that may be issued from the applications we have filed or may file in the future or that we may license from third parties. Additionally, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any term extensions that we seek may not be granted. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology or prevent third parties from marketing products that are similar or identical to ours.\nThere have been numerous changes to the patent laws that may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, President Obama signed the America Invents Act that codifies several significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including, among other things, changing from a \"first to invent\" to a \"first inventor to file\" system and creating a post-grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have been issued. This Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022 others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u2022 we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022 any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or exclusivity in a particular product area;\n\u2022 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022 the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were the owner of record, either solely or with a collaborator, of numerous issued U.S. patents and non-U.S. patents with claims to composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use or methods of manufacture in various indications. In addition, we are actively pursuing, either solely or with a collaborator, numerous additional U.S. patent applications, international (PCT) patent applications and non-U.S. patent applications in various jurisdictions.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Our patent applications would not prevent others from taking advantage of the chemical properties of boron to discover and develop new therapies, including therapies for the indications we are targeting. If others seek to develop boron-based therapies, their research and development efforts may inhibit our ability to conduct research in certain areas and to expand our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in the United States and other countries, which may be subject to government or third party objections that could prevent the issuance or maintenance of the applications or registrations. In addition, from time to time, parties may assert trademark or other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communication. If there is a determination that we have infringed third party proprietary rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to enforce or protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop another party from using the inventions claimed in any current or future patents that we obtain, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and may consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we are successful in stopping the infringement of such patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party's activities do not infringe our rights to such patents.\nThird parties may in the future seek FDA approval to market generic versions of our products, including KERYDIN, through an ANDA and challenge the patents protecting our products. If we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuits, some or all of our claims in the patents may be held invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed, and generic versions of our products could be launched prior to the expiration of our patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party's patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in such activities, including making or selling our products or product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and\nscientific personnel. There is a risk that a court could decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party's patents and order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we or our commercialization partners may not have a viable way around the patent and may need to halt commercialization of the relevant product. In addition, there is a risk that a court could order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party's patents and we may have indemnification obligations to our commercial partners in such circumstances.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology or first to file an application covering the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in litigation, interference, or other proceedings to determine our right to a patent. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our patent position with respect to such inventions.\nPatents covering the composition of matter of tavaborole and AN2718 that were owned by others have expired. Our patent applications and patents include or support claims on other aspects of tavaborole or AN2718, such as pharmaceutical formulations containing tavaborole or AN2718, methods of using tavaborole or AN2718 to treat disease and methods of manufacturing tavaborole or AN2718. Without patent protection on the composition of matter of tavaborole or AN2718, our ability to assert our patents to stop others from using or selling tavaborole or AN2718 may be limited.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. For example, in our legal proceedings with Valeant, we spent considerable resources, including management time, in the proceedings before reaching a settlement agreement with Valeant in October 2013 pursuant to which Valeant paid us $142.5 million to settle all existing and related future claims against Valeant, including claims for damages previously awarded to us pursuant to a prior arbitration ruling, and we agreed to provide Valeant a paid-up, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to all patents that contain claims covering efinaconazole.\nWe do not have exclusive rights to intellectual property we developed under U.S. federally funded research grants and contracts in connection with certain of our neglected diseases initiatives, including our research agreements with the Gates Foundation and DTRA, and, in the case of those funded research activities, we could ultimately share or lose the rights we do have under certain circumstances.\nSome of our intellectual property rights related to compounds that are not currently in clinical development were initially developed in the course of research funded by the U.S. government. As a\nresult, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future products pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. Government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if they determine that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. In addition, the U.S. government may acquire title in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits.\nSome of our intellectual property rights related to boron-containing compounds that are currently in clinical development, although not funded by the U.S. government, were developed through collaborations. For example, we receive research funding from DNDi, which requires that we share rights with DNDi. We have a co-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license with DNDi to make, use, import and manufacture products for treatment of HAT, Chagas disease and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in humans in all countries of the world, specifically excluding Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, China and all countries of North America and Europe (\"DNDi Territory\"). We also grant to DNDi an exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to distribute, including uses by, or on behalf of, a public sector agency, products containing molecules synthesized under the research plan for treatment of HAT, Chagas disease and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in humans in the DNDi Territory. As a result of these licenses, we are unlikely to realize any revenue in the DNDi Territory for any human therapeutics that we discover for these diseases. In March 2012, DNDi commenced Phase 1 human clinical trials of AN5568 in HAT. The AN5568 Phase 1 clinical trial is currently in its final stages and, depending upon the results of that trial, a Phase 2/3 registration trial could be initiated as early as the fourth quarter of 2015. The boron-containing compounds being studied in our DNDi collaboration are structurally distinct from our other clinical product candidates. Currently, none of our existing product candidates under development are being considered for use in the DNDi collaboration. Likewise, some of our intellectual property rights related to boron-containing compounds that are not currently in clinical development were developed through a collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (\"MMV\"). We accept research and development funding from MMV, and we provide MMV with a worldwide, royalty-free non-exclusive license (without the right to sublicense, except with our prior written approval) to intellectual property rights arising under the collaboration to develop human therapeutics for the treatment of malaria under our research and development agreements with MMV. The boron-containing compounds being researched under our MMV collaboration are currently structurally distinct from our clinical product candidates and none of our existing clinical product candidates are being considered for use in the MMV collaboration.\nUnder our Gates Foundation research agreement, our research efforts with respect to project compounds in neglected diseases and Gates Foundation priority areas in identified developing countries are subject to co-ownership or exclusive exploitation rights of the Gates Foundation. While we have a first right to develop and commercialize those project compounds, we are required to implement a global access program for such compounds and we may not be able to further develop or exploit project compounds identified in the collaboration.\nUnder our DTRA collaboration, we will design and discover new classes of systemic antibiotics under a drug discovery consortium led by us. Our research efforts under the DTRA collaboration are subject to co-ownership rights with our consortium partners and the U.S. Government.\nWe do not have exclusive rights to certain intellectual property as our rights to certain patents and molecules in our collaborations are jointly owned with our collaborators.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we jointly owned a small number of U.S. patents, U.S. patent applications and international (PCT) patent applications with certain of our collaborators. The rights of our collaborators to these patents, patent applications and other compounds under the collaborations may in the future restrict our ability to further develop or generate revenues from those compounds except through the collaborations.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe may need to expand certain of our operations and increase the size of our company, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs we increase the number of product development programs we have underway and advance our products and product candidates through development and commercialization, we may need to increase our product development, scientific, regulatory, marketing, sales and administrative headcount to manage these efforts. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects may require that we:\n\u2022 successfully attract and recruit new employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022 develop a marketing, sales and distribution capability;\n\u2022 manage our clinical programs effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous clinical sites; and\n\u2022 continue to develop our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage this growth, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management, sales and marketing, finance, scientific, clinical, legal, regulatory and administrative personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in Northern California. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercialization and business development expertise of our executive officers and key employees. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. We have entered into change of control and severance agreements with each of our officers as part of our retention efforts. Replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, motivate or retain these additional key personnel. Our failure to retain key personnel could materially harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which may adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will have been detected. If we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Business\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe sale of our approved products, including KERYDIN, and the use of our product candidates in clinical trials expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our partners by patients, participants enrolled in our clinical trials, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 recall of products;\n\u2022 decreased demand for our products or product candidates and loss of revenues;\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize our products;\n\u2022 substantial litigation costs;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 impairment of our business reputation; and\n\u2022 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our products, including KERYDIN. In addition, we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. Our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly\nexpensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on the unanticipated side effects of drug products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials, which could subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. While we rely on our third party manufacturers for our clinical and commercial product requirements, our operations, including our research and development operations, may produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of exposure of individuals to hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use of these materials and our liability may exceed our total assets. We maintain general liability insurance in the normal course of our business based on our consultation with our insurance consultants, and in light of current market conditions, including cost and availability. However, such coverage excludes pollution liability and may not be adequate to cover other claims related to our biological or hazardous materials. Furthermore, if we were to be held liable for a claim involving our biological or hazardous materials, this liability could exceed our insurance coverage, if any, and our other financial resources. Compliance with environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. For example, we do not carry earthquake insurance. In the event of a major earthquake in our region, our business could suffer significant and uninsured damage and loss. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers' compensation, products liability and directors' and officers' insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications and reporting obligations. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. In addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-that may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. Such data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, potential customers and others. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of KERYDIN pursuant to the Sandoz Agreement;\n\u2022 problems in our manufacturing or supply chain that limit or exhaust the quantity of supplies of KERYDIN or product candidates that are available to patients;\n\u2022 announcement of FDA approval or non-approval of our product candidates, and the timing of the FDA review process;\n\u2022 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to products or drug classes related to KERYDIN or our product candidates;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 results or delays of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our competitors' products;\n\u2022 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors' products;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors' operating results or changes in their product sales growth rates;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022 litigation, including disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, patents, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022 market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general; and\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. You may not realize any return on an investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nOwnership in our common stock is highly concentrated. Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock together beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock based on reports filed with the SEC. While this does not represent a majority of our outstanding common stock, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, will significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, may cause dilution to existing stockholders and may cause our share price to decline.\nWe may raise additional funds through the issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. For example, in October 2014, we issued and sold $90.5 million of Convertible Senior Notes. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, the Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible at the option of holders into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. As a result, conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders to the extent that we elect to deliver shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock) in connection therewith. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes could depress the price of our common stock. We may also issue shares of common stock, stock options, RSUs or other stock-based awards under our existing or future equity incentive plans, employee stock purchase plans or other employee or director compensation plans. The issuance of additional shares of common stock (including pursuant to conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes) or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm our business.\nCertain holders of our common stock and Convertible Senior Notes have demand registration rights, which could require us to register such securities for public sale at the holders' option.\nHolders of shares of our common stock who are party to an investors' rights agreement and a registration rights agreement with us have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. In addition, in connection with the sale of $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes (the \"Venrock Notes\") in October 2014 to certain funds affiliated with Venrock (the \"Venrock Funds\"), an affiliate of ours, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Venrock Funds. Pursuant to such registration rights agreement, the Venrock Funds may require us, from and after the one-year anniversary of the last date of original issuance of the Venrock Notes, to register the resale by the Venrock Funds of the Venrock Notes, any shares of our common stock issuable to the Venrock Funds upon conversion of the Venrock Notes or any other securities that may be issued or distributed in respect of such Venrock Notes or shares by way of conversion, dividend, stock split or other distribution or specified corporate transactions.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional expenses and administrative burden.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses and our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks, such as adopting additional internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, retaining a transfer agent and bearing all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the securities laws.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market, may create uncertainty for public companies, increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. We evaluate and monitor these rules and proposed changes to rules on an on-going basis, but cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and such investment will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management's time and attention from product development activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. In the future, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, and certain provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes, could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for\nappointing the members of our management team. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us, with some exceptions, from engaging in mergers, asset or stock sales or other business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Finally, our charter documents establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the Convertible Senior Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a \"fundamental change\" under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Senior Notes for cash. Similarly, if an acquisition event constitutes a \"make-whole fundamental change\" under the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their Convertible Senior Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.\nIf we commit certain material breaches under the research agreement with the Gates Foundation, and fail to cure them, we may be required to redeem shares of our common stock held by the Gates Foundation and its affiliates.\nIn the event of certain uncured material breaches by us under our research agreement with the Gates Foundation, we may be obligated, among other remedies, to redeem for cash the common stock purchased by the Gates Foundation in connection with the research agreement or facilitate the purchase of such common stock by a third party. If we are required to repurchase such shares of common stock, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 12392, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANAC"}
