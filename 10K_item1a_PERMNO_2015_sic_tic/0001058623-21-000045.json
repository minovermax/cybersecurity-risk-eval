Risk Factors\nMany statements contained or incorporated by reference in this Report are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on our current plans, intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" within Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those specifically identified below. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Except as may be required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nOperating Risks\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we and our partners, advertisers, and users operate.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively impacted the economy, disrupted consumer spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, we experienced a decline in revenue during the fiscal year 2020. We expect the COVID-19 global pandemic to continue to have a negative impact on our business including our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative impact it has on the economy and economic activity, changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior, impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic, its short and\nlonger-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad reaching effect on the economy and could have adverse impacts on national and local businesses that we currently rely on with respect to our operations, which has resulted and could continue to result in a decrease in advertising spend and/or heighten the risk with respect to the collectability of our accounts receivable. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a disruption in events we produce, including the cancellation or postponement of certain sporting events. The ultimate impact of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be impacted by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknown duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental regulations and other restrictions that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.\nWe continue to work with our stakeholders (including customers, employees, consumers, suppliers, business partners and local communities) to responsibly address this global pandemic. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess possible implications to our business and our stakeholders and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or its overall impact on our business. Even after the COVID-19 global pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe effects of COVID-19 may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur main source of revenue is the sale of advertising. Our ability to sell advertising depends on, among other things:\n\u2022economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022national and local demand for radio advertising;\n\u2022the popularity of the programming offered by our stations;\n\u2022changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u2022local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;\n\u2022the capability and effectiveness of our sales organization;\n\u2022our competitors' activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums;\n\u2022decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason; and\n\u2022other factors beyond our control.\nOur operations and revenues also tend to be seasonal in nature, with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year. This seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results. Such variations could have a material effect on the timing of our cash flows. In addition, our revenues tend to fluctuate between years, consistent with, among other things, increased advertising expenditures in even-numbered years by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups.\nThe loss of affiliation agreements by our radio networks could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have approximately 7,300 broadcast radio stations affiliated with our Westwood One network. Westwood One receives advertising inventory from its affiliated stations, either in the form of stand-alone advertising time within a specified time period or commercials inserted by its radio networks into their programming. In addition, primarily with respect to satellite radio providers, we receive a fee for providing such programming. The loss of network affiliation agreements by Westwood One could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the advertising inventory available to us to sell and the audience available for our network programming and, therefore, its attractiveness to advertisers. Renewals of such agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations through reductions of advertising revenue or increases in expenses.\nDisruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.\nAny internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally or externally, or any large-scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the Internet, may disrupt our business operations. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could negatively impact our operations and result in increased costs or reduced revenues. Our technology systems and related data also may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption as a result of events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial impact and consequences to our business's reputation.\nIn addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we may collect and store sensitive data about advertisers, vendors or other business partners and personal information of our employees. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches as a result of employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to advertisers', vendors', employees' or business partners' information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, significant liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and damage our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur business is and is expected to continue to be managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel, and the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to effectively train and manage our employee base. Although we have entered into employment and other retention agreements with some of our key management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances, we cannot be assured that all of those restrictions would be enforced if challenged in court.\nWe also from time to time enter into agreements with on-air personalities with large loyal audiences in their individual markets to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one or more of these personalities could result in losses of audience share in that particular market which, in turn, could adversely affect revenues in that particular market.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment and a decrease in our ratings or market share would adversely affect our revenues.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is very competitive. The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it can charge for its advertising which, in turn, depends on, among other things, the audience ratings of the stations, the number of local advertising competitors and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. These conditions are subject to change and highly susceptible to both micro- and macro-economic conditions.\nAudience ratings and market shares fluctuate, and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on ratings and, consequently, the revenue of stations located in that market. While we already compete with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets, any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses, and, consequently, could experience reduced operating results, if:\n\u2022another radio station in the market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional campaigns;\n\u2022a new station were to adopt a competitive format;\n\u2022we experience increased competition for advertising revenues from non-radio sources, including large scale online advertising platforms, such as Amazon, Facebook and Google;\n\u2022there is a shift in population, demographics, audience tastes and listening preferences or other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations; or\n\u2022any one or all of our stations were unable to maintain or increase advertising revenue or market share for any other reasons.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\"Telecom Act\") opened up markets to competition by removing regulatory barriers to entry. The Telecom Act may allow for the further consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in markets in which we operate or may operate in the future, which could further increase competition in these markets. In addition, some competing owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do, which could provide them with certain advantages in competing against us. Any future relaxation of ownership rules by the FCC could further remove barriers to competition from local media companies who might purchase radio stations in our markets. As a result of all the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the competitive environment will not affect us, and that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share.\nWe must continue to respond to the rapid changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive. Our failure to timely or appropriately respond to any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of other media technologies and services with which we compete for listeners and advertising dollars. We may not have the resources to acquire and deploy other technologies or to create or introduce new services that could effectively compete with these other technologies. Competition arising from other technologies or regulatory change may have a material adverse effect on us, and on the radio broadcasting industry as a whole. Various other audio technologies and services have been developed which compete for listeners and advertising dollars traditionally spent on radio advertising including:\n\u25e6personal digital audio and video devices (e.g. smart phones, tablets);\n\u25e6satellite delivered digital radio services that offer numerous programming channels such as Sirius Satellite Radio;\n\u25e6audio programming by internet content providers, internet radio stations such as Spotify and Pandora, cable systems, direct broadcast satellite systems and other digital audio broadcast formats;\n\u25e6low power FM radio stations, which are non-commercial FM radio broadcast outlets that serve small, localized areas;\n\u25e6applications that permit users to listen to programming on a time-delayed basis and to fast-forward through programming and/or advertisements (e.g. podcasts); and\n\u25e6search engine and e-commerce websites where a significant portion of their revenues are derived from advertising dollars such as Google, Facebook and Yelp.\nThese or other new technologies have the potential to change the means by which advertisers can reach target audiences most effectively. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from these or other technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry as a whole.\nFinancial Risks\nThe level and certain terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nOur debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect Cumulus's ability to operate its businesses, as well as significantly affect its liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect Cumulus's results of operations. These covenants restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Cumulus's ability to: incur additional indebtedness; grant liens; consummate mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sell assets; make investments, loans and advances; make payments and modifications to subordinated and other material debt instruments; enter into transactions with affiliates; consummate sale-leaseback transactions; enter into hedging arrangements; allow third parties to manage its stations, and sell substantially all of the stations' programming or advertising; transfer or assign FCC licenses to third parties; and change its lines of business.\nThe breach of any covenants or obligations in our debt agreements, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the agreements and could trigger acceleration of those obligations. Any default under our debt could adversely affect Cumulus's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make payments on debt.\nCertain of our variable debt uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the recommend alternative to LIBOR. The selection of SOFR\nas the alternative reference rate, however, currently presents certain market concerns because a term structure for SOFR has not yet developed, and there is not yet a generally accepted methodology for adjusting SOFR.\nThe discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.\nWe have written off, and could in the future be required to write off a significant portion of the fair value of our FCC licenses, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our FCC licenses comprised 44.4% of our assets. Each year, and more frequently on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), to assess the fair value of our FCC broadcast licenses to determine whether the carrying amount of those assets is impaired. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of these assets including estimating future cash flows, near-term and long-term revenue growth, and determining appropriate discount rates, among other assumptions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a total impairment charge on our FCC licenses of $4.5 million which is recorded within Impairment of Intangible Assets within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a total impairment charge on our FCC licenses of $16.7 million of which approximately $15.6 million is recorded within Impairment of Intangible Assets and the remainder, which relates to an FCC license held for sale, is recorded within Impairment of Assets Held for Sale within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Future impairment reviews could result in additional impairment charges. Any such impairment charges could materially adversely affect our financial results for the periods in which they are recorded.\nWe are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions.\nOur outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, which risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and enable us to avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We also maintain reserves to cover the uncollectibilty of a portion of our accounts receivable. There can be no assurance that such bad debt reserves will be sufficient.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries' earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our stations. Licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, we cannot assure you that the FCC will grant our existing or future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions out of the ordinary course. The non-renewal, or renewal with conditions, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe must also comply with the extensive FCC regulations and policies on the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations that could be material to our overall financial performance or our financial performance in a particular market.\nThe FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. Despite those limitations, a dispute could arise whether another station is improperly interfering with the operation of one of our stations or another radio licensee could complain to the FCC that one our stations is improperly\ninterfering with that licensee's station. There can be no assurance as to how the FCC might resolve such a dispute. These FCC regulations and others may change over time, and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLegislation and regulation of digital media businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or cause us to change our digital media technology platform or business model.\nU.S. and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are currently considering legislation or regulations that relate to digital advertising, including, for example, regulations related to the online collection and use of anonymous user data and unique device identifiers, such as Internet Protocol addresses (\"IP address\"), unique mobile device identifiers or geo-location data and other privacy and data protection regulation. Such legislation or regulations could affect the costs of doing business online, and could reduce the demand for our digital solutions or otherwise harm our digital operations. For example, a wide variety of state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business, such measures may not always be effective. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and could result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. In addition, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations governing privacy, data security or consumer protection, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, consumers or others. Any such proceedings could force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, result in fines or require us to pay significant monetary damages, damage our reputation, adversely affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of doing business or otherwise cause us to change our business practices or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our digital operations.\nThe FCC has been vigorous in its enforcement of its rules and regulations, including its indecency, sponsorship identification and EAS rules, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company is subject to many rules and regulations that govern the operations of its radio stations, and these rules may change from time to time. The FCC has previously imposed, or sought to impose, fines on the Company, such as a $540,000 penalty imposed on us in early 2016 for sponsorship identification violations occurring in 2011, nearly all of which occurred prior to the Company's ownership of the station and continued for approximately one month thereafter. In 2018, we informed the FCC of potential sponsorship identification violations regarding certain of our stations, and in August 2019, the FCC imposed a fine of $233,000 with respect to those violations. The FCC also has shortened the license renewal terms for certain of our radio stations in response to rule violations. It also is not uncommon for a radio station and the FCC to seek to settle alleged rule violations prior to the issuance of an order that would impose fines and other penalties, but such settlements or consent decrees usually result in the station owner paying money to the FCC. Notwithstanding the efforts by the Company to prevent violations of FCC rules and regulations, however, it is likely that the Company will continue to be subject to such penalties (whether through the issuance of orders by the FCC or the execution of settlement agreements) given the number of radio stations owned and operated by the Company, and those penalties could be substantial.\nFCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of \"obscene\" material at any time, and \"indecent\" material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC has historically enforced licensee compliance in this area through the assessment of monetary forfeitures. Such forfeitures may include: (i) imposition of the maximum authorized fine for egregious cases ($419,353 for a single violation, up to a maximum of $3,870,946 for a continuing violation); and (ii) imposition of fines on a per utterance basis instead of a single fine for an entire program. While we have no knowledge of any pending complaints before the FCC alleging that obscene or indecent material has been broadcast on any of our stations, such complaints may have been, or in the future may be, filed against our stations.\nThe FCC increased its enforcement of regulations requiring a radio station to include an on-air announcement which identifies the sponsor of all advertisements and other matter broadcast by any radio station for which any money, service or other valuable consideration is received. Fines for such violations can be substantial as they are dependent on the number of times a particular advertisement is broadcast. In addition, the FCC has recently increased its enforcement with respect to failure to comply with requirements regarding the maintenance of public inspection files for each radio station, which are maintained on an FCC database and therefore are easily accessible by members of the public and the FCC. Similarly, the FCC has recently sought to impose substantial fines on broadcasters who transmit Emergency Alert System (\"EAS\") codes, or simulations thereof, in the absence of an actual emergency or authorized test of the EAS. In 2014, for instance, the FCC imposed a fine of\n$1.9 million on three media companies, in 2015, it imposed a fine of $1 million on a radio broadcaster, and in 2019, it imposed a fine of $395,000 on a television network, in each case based on a determined misuse of EAS tones.\nThe Company is currently subject to, and may become subject to new, FCC inquiries or proceedings related to our stations' broadcasts or operations. We cannot predict the outcome of such inquiries and proceedings, but to the extent that such inquiries or proceedings result in the imposition of fines (alone or in the aggregate), a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislation could require radio broadcasters to pay additional royalties, including to additional parties such as record labels or recording artists.\nWe currently pay royalties to song composers and publishers through BMI, ASCAP, SESAC and GMR but not to record labels or recording artists for exhibition or use of over the air broadcasts of music. From time to time, Congress considers legislation which could change the copyright fees and the procedures by which the fees are determined and the entities to whom fees must be paid. Such legislation historically has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the broadcast industry and other parties affected by the proposed legislation. It cannot be predicted whether any proposed future legislation will become law or what impact it would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial position.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe public market for our Class A Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of such factors as:\n\u2022the total number of shares of Class A common stock available to trade and the low trading volume of the stock;\n\u2022the total amount of our indebtedness and our ability to service that debt;\n\u2022conditions and trends in the radio broadcasting industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;\n\u2022estimates of our future performance and/or operations;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022technological innovations;\n\u2022competitive developments;\n\u2022adoption of new accounting standards affecting companies in general or affecting companies in the radio broadcasting industry in particular; and\n\u2022general market conditions and other factors.\nFurther, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Market, the market on which our Class A common stock is listed, from time to time have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were not necessarily related or proportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. In addition, general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate movements or international currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe rights plan adopted by our Board may impair a takeover attempt.\nOn May 20, 2020, our Board adopted a rights plan and declared a dividend of (a) one Class A right (a \"Class A Right\") in respect of each share of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0000001 per share (the \"Class A Common Shares\"), (b) one Class B right (a \"Class B Right\") in respect of each share of the Company's Class B common stock, par value $0.0000001 per share (the \"Class B Common Shares\" and together with the Class A Common Shares, the \"Common Shares\"), (c) one Series 1 warrant right (a \"Series 1 Warrant Right\") in respect of each of the Company's Series 1 warrants (the \"Series 1 Warrants\"), and (d) one Series 2 warrant right (a \"Series 2 Warrant Right,\" and together with the Class A Rights, the Class B Rights and the Series 1 Warrant Rights, the \"Rights\") in respect of each of the Company's Series 2 warrants (the \"Series 2 Warrants,\" and together with the Series 1 Warrants, the \"Warrants\"). The dividend distribution was made on June 1, 2020 to the Company's stockholders and Warrant holders of record on that date. In the event that a person or group that is or becomes the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Shares (20% or more in the case of a passive institutional investor), subject to certain exceptions, (a) each Class A Right would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a Class A Common Share for a purchase price of $25.00, (b) each Class B Right would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a Class B Common Share for a purchase price of $25.00, (c)\neach Series 1 Warrant Right would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a Series 1 Warrant for a purchase price of $25.00, and (d) each Series 2 Warrant would allow its holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a Series 2 Warrant for a purchase price of $25.00.\nIn addition, after a person or group has become a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding Class A Common Shares (20% or more in the case of a passive institutional investor), but before any person beneficially owns 50% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Shares, the Board may exchange each Right (other than Rights that have become null and void) at an exchange ratio of (a) one Class A Common Share per Class A Right, (b) one Class B Common Share per Class B Right, (c) one Series 1 Warrant per Series 1 Warrant Right, and (d) one Series 2 Warrant per Series 2 Warrant Right. The shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company or a large block of our Common Shares without the approval of our Board. Unless earlier redeemed or exchanged, the Rights will expire on April 30, 2021.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains and incorporates by reference \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").
