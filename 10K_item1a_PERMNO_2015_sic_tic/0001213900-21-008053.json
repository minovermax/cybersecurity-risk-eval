You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together\nwith the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes,\nbefore making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition\nand operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline,\nand you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk\nFactor Summary\nRisks\nRelated to ChargePoint\n\u25cf ChargePoint\nis an early stage company with a history of losses, and expects to incur significant\nexpenses and continuing losses for the near term.\n\u25cf If\nChargePoint fails to manage growth effectively, its business, operating results and financial\ncondition could be affected.\n\u25cf ChargePoint\ncurrently faces competition from a number of companies, particularly in Europe, and expects\nto face significant competition in the future as the market for electric vehicle (\u201cEV\u201d)\ncharging develops.\n\u25cf Some\nmembers of ChargePoint\u2019s management have limited experience in operating a public\ncompany.\n\u25cf Changes\nto fuel economy standards or the success of alternate fuels may negatively impact the\nEV market and thus the demand for ChargePoint\u2019s products and services.\n\u25cf ChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture growth and success is highly correlated with and thus dependent upon the continuing\nrapid adoption of EVs for passenger and fleet applications.\n\u25cf The\nreduction, modification, or elimination of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives\nfrom governments, utilities and others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs\nand EV charging stations could cause reduced demand for EVs and EV charging stations,\nwhich would adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s financial results.\n\u25cf The\nEV charging market is characterized by rapid technological change, which requires ChargePoint\nto continue to develop new products and product innovations. Any delays in such developments\ncould adversely affect market adoption of its products and ChargePoint\u2019s financial\nresults.\n\u25cf ChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness may be adversely affected if it is unable to protect its technology and intellectual\nproperty from unauthorized use by third parties.\n\u25cf ChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness will depend upon customers renewing their services subscriptions. If customers\ndo not continue to use its subscription offerings or if they fail to add more stations,\nits business and operating results will be adversely affected.\n\u25cf ChargePoint\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operation are likely to fluctuate on a quarterly basis\nin future periods, which could cause its results for a particular period to fall below\nexpectations, resulting in a decline in the price of the post-combination company\u2019s\ncommon stock.\n\u25cf New\nChargePoint will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a\npublic company, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nRisks\nRelated to Switchback\n\u25cf We\nare a newly incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have\nno basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\n\u25cf Past\nperformance by our management team and NGP may not be indicative of future performance\nof an investment in us.\n\u25cf Our\npublic stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on an alternate business\ncombination, which means we may complete an initial business combination even though\na majority of our public stockholders do not support such combination.\n\u25cf Your\nonly opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination\nmay be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\n\u25cf If\nwe seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination, as we plan to do for\nthe proposed Business Combination, our initial stockholders and management team have\nagreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public\nstockholders vote.\n\u25cf The\nability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial\ncondition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult\nfor us to enter into a business combination with a target.\n\u25cf The\nability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a larger\nnumber of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination\nwould be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem\nyour shares.\n\u25cf The\nrequirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe\nmay give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination\nand may limit the time we have to conduct due diligence on potential business combination\ntargets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to\ncomplete our business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.\n\u25cf Any\ntarget with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, including ChargePoint\nas contemplated by the proposed Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected\nby the recent coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak and the status of debt and\nequity markets.\n\u25cf If\na stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection\nwith our business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its\nshares, such shares may not be redeemed.\n\u25cf Shareholders\nhave no rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited\ncircumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your\npublic shares or warrants, potentially for a loss.\n\u25cf If\nwe are unable to complete the Business Combination or an alternate initial business combination,\nour public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust\naccount that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants\nwill expire without value to the holder.\n\u25cf The\nother risks and uncertainties discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks\nRelated to ChargePoint\u2019s Business\nChargePoint\nis an early stage company with a history of losses, and expects to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the near\nterm.\nChargePoint\nincurred a net loss of $134.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 and as of January 31, 2020, ChargePoint\nhad an accumulated deficit of approximately $482.4 million. ChargePoint believes it will continue to incur operating and\nnet losses each quarter for the near term. Even if it achieves profitability, there can be no assurance that it will be able maintain\nprofitability in the future. ChargePoint\u2019s potential profitability is particularly dependent upon the continued adoption\nof EV\u2019s by consumers and fleet operators, the widespread adoption of electric trucks and other vehicles and other electric\ntransportation modalities, which may not occur.\nChargePoint\nhas experienced rapid growth and expects to invest in growth for the foreseeable future. If it fails to manage growth effectively,\nits business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChargePoint\nhas experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For example, the number of employees has grown from 587 as of January 31,\n2019 to 743 as of January 31, 2020, including 54 employees in Europe as of January 31, 2019 to 77 as of January 31,\n2020. The growth and expansion of its business has placed and continues to place a significant strain on management, operations,\nfinancial infrastructure and corporate culture. In the event of further growth, ChargePoint\u2019s information technology systems\nand ChargePoint\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and procedures may not be adequate to support its operations\nand may introduce opportunities for data security incidents that may interrupt business operations and permit bad actors to obtain\nunauthorized access to business information or misappropriate funds. ChargePoint may also face risks to the extent such bad actors\ninfiltrate the information technology infrastructure of its contractors.\nTo\nmanage growth in operations and personnel, ChargePoint will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management\ncontrols and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to manage growth effectively could result in difficulty or delays in attracting\nnew customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new products and\nservices or enhancing existing products and services, loss of customers, information security vulnerabilities or other operational\ndifficulties, any of which could adversely affect its business performance and operating results.\nChargePoint\ncurrently faces competition from a number of companies, particularly in Europe, and expects to face significant competition in\nthe future as the market for EV charging develops.\nThe\nEV charging market is relatively new and competition is still developing. ChargePoint primarily competes with smaller providers\nof EV charging station networks for installations, particularly in Europe. Large early stage markets, such as Europe, require\nearly engagement across verticals and customers to gain market share, and ongoing effort to scale channels, installers, teams\nand processes. Some European customers require solutions not yet available and ChargePoint\u2019s recent entrance into Europe\nrequires establishing itself against existing competitors. In addition, there are multiple competitors in Europe with limited\nfunding, which could cause poor experiences, hampering overall EV adoption or trust in any particular provider.\nIn\naddition, there are other means for charging EVs, which could affect the level of demand for onsite charging capabilities at businesses.\nFor example, Tesla Inc. continues to build out its supercharger network across the United States for its vehicles, which\ncould reduce overall demand for EV charging at other sites. Also, third-party contractors can provide basic electric charging\ncapabilities to potential customers seeking to have on premise EV charging capability as well as for home charging. In addition,\nmany EV charging manufacturers, including ChargePoint, are offering home charging equipment, which could reduce demand for on\npremise charging capabilities of potential customers and reduce the demand for onsite charging capabilities if EV owners find\ncharging at home to be sufficient.\nFurther,\nChargePoint\u2019s current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result,\ncompetitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than ChargePoint to new or changing opportunities, technologies,\nstandards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition,\ncompetitors may in the future establish cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services\nto increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace. This competition may also materialize in the form of costly\nintellectual property disputes or litigation.\nNew\ncompetitors or alliances may emerge in the future that have greater market share, more widely adopted proprietary technologies,\ngreater marketing expertise and greater financial resources, which could put ChargePoint at a competitive disadvantage. Future\ncompetitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of ChargePoint\u2019s current or future target markets,\nwhich could create price pressure. In light of these factors, even if ChargePoint\u2019s offerings are more effective and higher\nquality than those of its competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive solutions. If ChargePoint fails to\nadapt to changing market conditions or continue to compete successfully with current charging providers or new competitors, its\ngrowth will be limited which would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nChargePoint\nfaces risks related to health pandemics, including the recent coronavirus pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect\non its business and results of operations.\nThe\nimpact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer and business behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions\non business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy and has led to reduced economic\nactivity. The spread of COVID-19 has also created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of\nvehicle manufacturers and suppliers, and has led to a decrease in EV sales in markets around the world. Any sustained downturn\nin demand for EVs would harm ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nThe\npandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans\nand restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. These measures may adversely\nimpact ChargePoint\u2019s employees and operations and the operations of its customers, suppliers, vendors and business partners,\nand may negatively impact demand for EV charging stations, particularly at workplaces. These measures by government authorities\nmay remain in place for a significant period of time and may adversely affect manufacturing and building plans, sales and marketing\nactivities, business and results of operations.\nChargePoint\nhas modified its business practices by recommending that all non-essential personnel work from home and cancelling or reducing\nphysical participation in sales activities, meetings, events and conferences. ChargePoint has also implemented additional safety\nprotocols for essential workers, has implemented cost cutting measures in order to reduce its operating costs, and may take further\nactions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers,\nsuppliers, vendors and business partners. There is no certainty that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed\nby the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of ChargePoint\u2019s workforce\nare unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions or other restrictions\nin connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, its operations will be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if significant portions\nof its customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 workforces are subject to stay at home orders or otherwise have substantial\nnumbers of their employees working remotely for sustained periods of time, user demand for charging stations and services will\ndecline.\nThe\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts ChargePoint\u2019s business, prospects and results of operations will depend\non future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread\nof the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and when and to what extent normal economic\nand operating activities can resume. The COVID-19 pandemic could limit the ability of customers, suppliers, vendors and business\npartners to perform, including third-party suppliers\u2019 ability to provide components and materials used in charging\nstations or in providing installation or maintenance services. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, ChargePoint\nmay continue to experience an adverse impact to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession\nthat has occurred or may occur in the future. Specifically, difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in per capita\nincome and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reduced spending by businesses, could each have a material adverse effect on the demand\nfor ChargePoint\u2019s products and services.\nChargePoint\nrelies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for its charging stations. A loss of any of these partners could negatively\naffect its business.\nChargePoint\nrelies on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture its charging stations, including in some cases only a single supplier for\nsome products and components. This reliance on a limited number of manufacturers increases ChargePoint\u2019s risks, since it\ndoes not currently have proven reliable alternative or replacement manufacturers beyond these key parties. In the event of interruption,\nit may not be able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or secondary sources without incurring material\nadditional costs and substantial delays. Thus, ChargePoint\u2019s business could be adversely affected if one or more of its\nsuppliers is impacted by any interruption at a particular location.\nIf\nChargePoint experiences a significant increase in demand for its charging stations, or if it needs to replace an existing supplier,\nit may not be possible to supplement or replace them on acceptable terms, which may undermine its ability to deliver products\nto customers in a timely manner. For example, it may take a significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer that has the\ncapability and resources to build charging stations in sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers and manufacturers could\nbe an extensive process that requires ChargePoint to become satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness\nand service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any significant\nsuppliers or manufacturers could have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness is subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns and delays, and other contingencies that may arise in\nthe course of completing installations, and such risks may increase in the future as ChargePoint expands the scope of such services\nwith other parties.\nChargePoint\ndoes not typically install charging stations at customer sites. These installations are typically performed by ChargePoint partners\nor electrical contractors with an existing relationship with the customer and/or knowledge of the site. The installation of charging\nstations at a particular site is generally subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with state and local laws and ordinances\nrelating to building codes, safety, environmental protection and related matters, and typically requires various local and other\ngovernmental approvals and permits that may vary by jurisdiction. In addition, building codes, accessibility requirements or regulations\nmay hinder EV charger installation because they end up costing the developer or installer more in order to meet the code requirements.\nMeaningful delays or cost overruns may impact ChargePoint\u2019s recognition of revenue in certain cases and/or impact customer\nrelationships, either of which could impact ChargePoint\u2019s business and profitability.\nFurthermore,\nChargePoint may in the future elect to install charging stations at customer sites or manage contractors, likely as part of offering\ncustomers a turnkey solution. Working with contractors may require ChargePoint to obtain licenses or require it or its customers\nto comply with additional rules, working conditions and other union requirements, which can add costs and complexity to an installation\nproject. In addition, if these contractors are unable to provide timely, thorough and quality installation-related services,\ncustomers could fall behind their construction schedules leading to liability to ChargePoint or cause customers to become dissatisfied\nwith the solutions ChargePoint offers.\nWhile\nChargePoint to date has not made material acquisitions, should it pursue acquisitions in the future, it would be subject to risks\nassociated with acquisitions.\nChargePoint\nmay acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to its existing business. The process\nof identifying and consummating acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into ChargePoint\u2019s\nown business would require attention from management and could result in a diversion of resources from its existing business,\nwhich in turn could have an adverse effect on its operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the expected financial\nresults. Acquisitions could also result in the use of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence\nof goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities\nof the acquired business.\nIf\nChargePoint is unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, engineering and sales personnel,\nits ability to compete and successfully grow its business would be harmed.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nsuccess depends, in part, on its continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop and retain highly qualified\npersonnel. The inability to do so effectively would adversely affect its business.\nCompetition\nfor employees can be intense, particularly in Silicon Valley where ChargePoint is headquartered, and the ability to attract, hire\nand retain them depends on ChargePoint\u2019s ability to provide competitive compensation. ChargePoint may not be able to attract,\nassimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and failure to do so could adversely affect its business, including\nthe execution of its global business strategy.\nChargePoint\nis expanding operations internationally, which will expose it to additional tax, compliance, market and other risks.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nprimary operations are in the United States and it maintains contractual relationships with parts and manufacturing suppliers\nin Asia, Mexico and other locations. Also, ChargePoint is continuing to invest to increase its presence in Europe and to expand\na primarily software development team in India. Managing this expansion requires additional resources and controls, and could\nsubject ChargePoint to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u25cf conformity\nwith applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated\nexpenses;\n\u25cf lack\nof availability of government incentives and subsidies;\n\u25cf challenges\nin arranging, and availability of, financing for customers;\n\u25cf potential\nchanges to its established business model;\n\u25cf cost\nof alternative power sources, which could vary meaningfully outside the United States;\n\u25cf difficulties\nin staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws,\nand customers, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs\nassociated with international operations;\n\u25cf installation\nchallenges;\n\u25cf differing\ndriving habits and transportation modalities in other markets;\n\u25cf different\nlevels of demand among commercial, fleet and residential customers;\n\u25cf compliance\nwith multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations, certifications,\nand permitting processes including environmental, banking, employment, tax, information\nsecurity, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations such as the European Union\n(the \u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), national\nlegislation implementing the same and changing requirements for legally transferring\ndata out of the European Economic Area;\n\u25cf compliance\nwith U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the United Kingdom Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u25cf conforming\nproducts to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging\nand other electric infrastructures;\n\u25cf difficulty\nin establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf difficulties\nin collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u25cf restrictions\non repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf compliance\nwith potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions and compliance\nwith applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity\nand adverse consequences of such tax laws, and potentially adverse tax consequences due\nto changes in such tax laws; and\n\u25cf regional\neconomic and political conditions.\nAs\na result of these risks, ChargePoint\u2019s current expansion efforts and any potential future international expansion efforts\nmay not be successful.\nSome\nmembers of ChargePoint\u2019s management have limited experience in operating a public company.\nSome\nof ChargePoint\u2019s executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly-traded company. The management\nteam may not successfully or effectively manage the transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory\noversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex\nlaws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their\ntime may be devoted to these activities, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the company.\nChargePoint may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting\npolicies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies. The development and implementation\nof the standards and controls and the hiring of experienced personnel necessary to achieve the level of accounting standards required\nof a public company may require costs greater than expected.\nChargePoint\nmay need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available when needed.\nChargePoint\nmay need to raise additional capital in the future to further scale its business and expand to additional markets. ChargePoint\nmay raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities, or through obtaining credit\nfrom government or financial institutions. ChargePoint cannot be certain that additional funds will be available on favorable\nterms when required, or at all. If ChargePoint cannot raise additional funds when needed, its financial condition, results of\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If ChargePoint raises funds through the issuance\nof debt securities or through loan arrangements, the terms of which could require significant interest payments, contain covenants\nthat restrict ChargePoint\u2019s business, or other unfavorable terms. In addition, to the extent ChargePoint raises funds through\nthe sale of additional equity securities, ChargePoint stockholders would experience additional dilution.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nheadquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone; an earthquake or other types of natural disasters\nor resource shortages, including public safety power shut-offs that have occurred and will continue to occur in California, could\ndisrupt and harm its operations and those of ChargePoint\u2019s customers.\nChargePoint\nconducts a majority of its operations in the San Francisco Bay area in an active earthquake zone. The occurrence of a natural\ndisaster such as an earthquake, drought, flood, fire (such as the recent extensive wildfires in California), localized extended\noutages of critical utilities (such as California\u2019s public safety power shut-offs) or transportation systems, or any critical\nresource shortages could cause a significant interruption in its business, damage or destroy its facilities or inventory, and\ncause it to incur significant costs, any of which could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. The\ninsurance ChargePoint maintains against fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover losses in\nany particular case.\nIn\naddition, rolling public safety power shut offs in California or other states can affect user acceptance of EVs, as charging may\nbe unavailable at the desired times, or at all during these events. These shut offs could also affect the ability of fleet operators\nto charge their EVs, which, for example, could adversely affect transportation schedules or any service level agreements to which\neither ChargePoint or the fleet operator may be a party. If these events persist, the demand for EVs could decline, which would\nresult in reduced demand for charging solutions.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture revenue growth will depend in significant part on its ability to increase sales of its products and services to fleet operators.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture revenue growth will depend in significant part on its ability to increase sales of its products and services to fleet operators.\nThe electrification of fleets is an emerging market, and fleet operators may not adopt EVs on a widespread basis and on the timelines\nChargePoint anticipates. In addition to the factors affecting the growth of the EV market generally, transitioning to an EV fleet\ncan be costly and capital intensive, which could result in slower than anticipated adoption. The sales cycle could also be longer\nfor sales to fleet operators, as they are often larger organizations, with more formal procurement processes than smaller commercial\nsite hosts. Fleet operators may also require significant additional services and support, and if ChargePoint is unable to provide\nsuch services and support, it may adversely affect its ability to attract additional fleet operators as customers. Any failure\nto attract and retain fleet operators as customers in the future would adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results\nof operations.\nComputer\nmalware, viruses, ransomware, hacking, phishing attacks and similar disruptions could result in security and privacy breaches\nand interruption in service, which could harm ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nComputer\nmalware, viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could lead to interruption and delays in ChargePoint\u2019s\nservices and operations and loss, misuse or theft of data. Computer malware, viruses, ransomware, hacking and phishing attacks\nagainst online networks have become more prevalent and may occur on ChargePoint\u2019s systems in the future. Any attempts by\ncyber attackers to disrupt ChargePoint\u2019s services or systems, if successful, could harm its business, introduce liability\nto data subjects, result in the misappropriation of funds, be expensive to remedy and damage its reputation or brand. Insurance\nmay not be sufficient to cover significant expenses and losses related to cyber-attacks. Efforts to prevent cyber attackers from\nentering computer systems are expensive to implement, and ChargePoint may not be able to cause the implementation or enforcement\nof such preventions with respect to its third-party vendors. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly\nresult from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of\nsystems and technical infrastructure may, in addition to other losses, harm ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, brand and ability\nto attract customers.\nChargePoint\nhas previously experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due\nto a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, third-party service providers, human or software errors and capacity\nconstraints. If ChargePoint\u2019s services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, they may seek other services,\nwhich could reduce demand for its solutions from target customers.\nChargePoint\nhas processes and procedures in place designed to enable it to quickly recover from a disaster or catastrophe and continue business\noperations and has tested this capability under controlled circumstances. However, there are several factors ranging from human\nerror to data corruption that could materially impact the efficacy of such processes and procedures, including by lengthening\nthe time services are partially or fully unavailable to customers and users. It may be difficult or impossible to perform some\nor all recovery steps and continue normal business operations due to the nature of a particular disaster or catastrophe, especially\nduring peak periods, which could cause additional reputational damages, or loss of revenues, any of which could adversely affect\nits business and financial results.\nRisks\nRelated to the EV Market\nChanges\nto fuel economy standards or the success of alternative fuels may negatively impact the EV market and thus the demand for ChargePoint\u2019s\nproducts and services.\nAs\nregulatory initiatives have required an increase in the mileage capabilities of cars, consumption of renewable transportation\nfuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, and consumer acceptance of EVs and other alternative vehicles has been increasing. If fuel\nefficiency of non-electric vehicles continues to rise, whether as the result of regulations or otherwise, and affordability\nof vehicles using renewable transportation fuels improves, the demand for electric and high energy vehicles could diminish. In\naddition, the EV fueling model is different than gas or other fuel models, requiring behavior change and education of influencers,\nconsumers and others such as regulatory bodies. Developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel\ncells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely\naffect demand for EVs and EV charging stations. For example, fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in the United States,\nsuch as compressed natural gas, may emerge as preferred alternative to petroleum-based propulsion. Regulatory bodies may\nalso adopt rules that substantially favor certain alternatives to petroleum-based propulsion over others, which may not necessarily\nbe EVs. This may impose additional obstacles to the purchase of EVs or the development of a more ubiquitous EV market. Finally,\nthe current litigation between the state of California and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could impact California\u2019s\nability to set fuel economy standards that encourage the adoption of EVs, and could be followed by many other states. If any of\nthe above cause or contribute to consumers or businesses to no longer purchase EVs or purchase them at a lower rate, it would\nmaterially and adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture growth and success is highly correlated with and thus dependent upon the continuing rapid adoption of EVs for passenger\nand fleet applications.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture growth is highly dependent upon the adoption of EVs by businesses and consumers. The market for EVs is still rapidly evolving,\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technologies, competitive pricing and competitive factors, evolving government regulation and\nindustry standards and changing consumer demands and behaviors, changing levels of concern related to environmental issues and\ngovernmental initiatives related to climate change and the environment generally. Although demand for EVs has grown in recent\nyears, there is no guarantee of continuing future demand. If the market for EVs develops more slowly than expected, or if demand\nfor EVs decreases, ChargePoint\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be harmed. The market\nfor EVs could be affected by numerous factors, such as:\n\u25cf perceptions\nabout EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n\u25cf perceptions\nabout the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge;\n\u25cf competition,\nincluding from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric\nvehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;\n\u25cf volatility\nin the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf concerns\nregarding the stability of the electrical grid;\n\u25cf the\ndecline of an EV battery\u2019s ability to hold a charge over time;\n\u25cf availability\nof service for EVs;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019\nperception about the convenience and cost of charging EVs;\n\u25cf increases\nin fuel efficiency;\n\u25cf government\nregulations and economic incentives, including adverse changes in, or expiration of,\nfavorable tax incentives related to EVs, EV charging stations or decarbonization generally;\n\u25cf relaxation\nof government mandates or quotas regarding the sale of EVs; and\n\u25cf concerns\nabout the future viability of EV manufacturers.\nIn\naddition, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry can be cyclical, which may affect growth in acceptance of EVs. It is uncertain\nhow macroeconomic factors will impact demand for EVs, particularly since they can be more expensive than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles,\nwhen the automotive industry globally has been experiencing a recent decline in sales. Furthermore, because fleet operators often\nmake large purchases of EVs, this cyclicality and volatility in the automotive industry may be more pronounced with commercial\npurchasers, and any significant decline in demand from these customers could reduce demand for EV charging and ChargePoint\u2019s\nproducts and services in particular.\nDemand\nfor EVs may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile prices or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles,\nsuch as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations,\nincluding tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which may result\nin reduced demand for EV charging solutions and therefore adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business, financial condition and\noperating results.\nThe\nEV market currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives from governments, utilities\nand others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs and EV charging stations. In particular, ChargePoint\u2019s marketing\nefforts have heavily relied upon federal tax credits available to purchasers of its EV charging stations that effectively provide\npurchasers with a significantly discounted purchase price. The reduction, modification, or elimination of such benefits could\ncause reduced demand for EVs and EV charging stations, which would adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s financial results.\nThe\nU.S. federal government, foreign governments and some state and local governments provide incentives to end users and purchasers\nof EVs and EV charging stations in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, such as payments for regulatory\ncredits. The EV market relies on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to significantly lower\nthe effective price of EVs and EV charging stations to customers. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end\nwhen the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy. In particular,\nChargePoint has heavily relied upon the availability of federal tax credits to purchasers under Section 30C of the Code (as\ndefined below) to market its EV charging stations, which can effectively provide such purchasers with up to a 30% discount off\nthe purchase price of ChargePoint\u2019s EV charging stations. The credits under Section 30C of the Code are set to expire\non December 31, 2020 and thus would not be available to ChargePoint\u2019s customers unless extended. There can be no assurance\nthat the credits under Section 30C of the Code will be extended, or if extended, will not be otherwise reduced. Any\nreduction in rebates, tax credits or other financial incentives, including the credit under Section 30C of the Code, could\nmaterially reduce the demand for EVs and ChargePoint\u2019s solutions and, as a result, may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness and expansion potential.\nChargePoint\nalso derives other revenue from regulatory credits. If government support of these credits declines, ChargePoint\u2019s ability\nto generate this other revenue in the future would be adversely affected. Recently, ChargePoint has derived a slight majority\nof its other revenue from regulatory credits, and ChargePoint expects revenue from this source will decline as a percentage of\nother and total revenue over time. Further, the availability of such credits may decline even with general governmental support\nof the transition to EV infrastructure. For example, in September 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order\nN-79-20 (the \u201cEO\u201d), announcing a target for all in-state sales of new passenger cars and trucks to be zero-emission by\n2035. While the EO calls for the support of EV infrastructure, the form of this support is unclear. If California or other jurisdictions\nchoose to adopt regulatory mandates instead of establishing or continuing green energy credit regimes for EV infrastructure, ChargePoint\u2019s\nrevenue from these credits would be adversely impacted.\nThe\nEV charging market is characterized by rapid technological change, which requires ChargePoint to continue to develop new products\nand product innovations. Any delays in such development could adversely affect market adoption of its products and ChargePoint\u2019s\nfinancial results.\nContinuing\ntechnological changes in battery and other EV technologies could adversely affect adoption of current EV charging technology and/or\nChargePoint\u2019s products. ChargePoint\u2019s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce a variety\nof new capabilities and innovations to its existing product offerings, as well as introduce a variety of new product offerings,\nto address the changing needs of the EV charging market. As new products are introduced, gross margins tend to decline in the\nnear term and improves as the product become more mature and with a more efficient manufacturing process.\nAs\nEV technologies change, ChargePoint may need to upgrade or adapt its charging station technology and introduce new products and\nservices in order to serve vehicles that have the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology, which could involve\nsubstantial costs. Even if ChargePoint is able to keep pace with changes in technology and develop new products and services,\nits research and development expenses could increase, its gross margins could be adversely affected in some periods and its prior\nproducts could become obsolete more quickly than expected.\nChargePoint\ncannot guarantee that any new products will be released in a timely manner, or at all, or achieve market acceptance. Delays in\ndelivering new products that meet customer requirements could damage ChargePoint\u2019s relationships with customers and lead\nthem to seek alternative providers. Delays in introducing products and innovations or the failure to offer innovative products\nor services at competitive prices may cause existing and potential customers to purchase ChargePoint\u2019s competitors\u2019\nproducts or services.\nIf\nChargePoint is unable to devote adequate resources to develop products or cannot otherwise successfully develop products or services\nthat meet customer requirements on a timely basis or that remain competitive with technological alternatives, its products and\nservices could lose market share, its revenue will decline, it may experience higher operating losses and its business and prospects\nwill be adversely affected.\nRisks\nRelated to ChargePoint\u2019s Technology, Intellectual Property and Infrastructure\nChargePoint\nmay need to defend against intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive.\nFrom\ntime to time, the holders of intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge ChargePoint to take licenses, and/or\nmay bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights. There can be no assurance that ChargePoint will be able\nto mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by competitors or other third parties. Accordingly, ChargePoint\nmay consider entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses\ncan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly\nincrease ChargePoint\u2019s operating expenses. In addition, if ChargePoint is determined to have or believes there is a high\nlikelihood that it has infringed upon or misappropriated a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, it may be required\nto cease making, selling or incorporating certain key components or intellectual property into the products and services it offers,\nto pay substantial damages and/or royalties, to redesign its products and services, and/or to establish and maintain alternative\nbranding. In addition, to the extent that ChargePoint\u2019s customers and business partners become the subject of any allegation\nor claim regarding the infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights related to ChargePoint\u2019s products\nand services, ChargePoint may be required to indemnify such customers and business partners. If ChargePoint were required to take\none or more such actions, its business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely\naffected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and\ndiversion of resources and management attention.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness may be adversely affected if it is unable to protect its technology and intellectual property from unauthorized use by\nthird parties.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nsuccess depends, at least in part, on ChargePoint\u2019s ability to protect its core technology and intellectual property. To\naccomplish this, ChargePoint relies on, and plans to continue relying on, a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how),\nemployee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual\nrights to retain ownership of, and protect, its technology. Failure to adequately protect its technology and intellectual property\ncould result in competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of ChargePoint\u2019s competitive\nadvantage and a decrease in revenue which would adversely affect its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe\nmeasures ChargePoint takes to protect its technology intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective\nfor various reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf any\npatent applications ChargePoint submits may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u25cf the\nscope of issued patents may not be broad enough to protect proprietary rights;\n\u25cf any\nissued patents may be challenged by competitors and/or invalidated by courts or governmental\nauthorities;\n\u25cf the\ncosts associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or\nother intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;\n\u25cf current\nand future competitors may circumvent patents or independently develop similar trade\nsecrets or works of authorship, such as software;\n\u25cf know-how and\nother proprietary information ChargePoint purports to hold as a trade secret may not\nqualify as a trade secret under applicable laws; and\n\u25cf proprietary\ndesigns and technology embodied in ChargePoint\u2019s products may be discoverable by\nthird-parties through means that do not constitute violations of applicable laws.\nPatent,\ntrademark, and trade secret laws vary significantly throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property\nrights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, policing the unauthorized use of its intellectual\nproperty in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult or impossible. Therefore, ChargePoint\u2019s intellectual property rights\nmay not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the United States.\nCertain\npatents in the EV space may come to be considered \u201cstandards essential.\u201d If this is the case with respect to any of\nChargePoint\u2019s patents, it may be required to license certain technology on \u201cfair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\u201d\nterms, decreasing revenue. Further, competitors, vendors, or customers may, in certain instances, be free to create variations\nor derivative works of ChargePoint technology and intellectual property, and those derivative works may become directly competitive\nwith ChargePoint\u2019s offerings. Finally, ChargePoint may not be able to leverage, or obtain ownership of, all technology and\nintellectual property developed by ChargePoint\u2019s vendors in connection with design and manufacture of ChargePoint\u2019s\nproducts, thereby jeopardizing ChargePoint\u2019s ability to obtain a competitive advantage over its competitors.\nThe\ncurrent lack of international standards may lead to uncertainty, additional competition and further unexpected costs.\nLack\nof industry standards for EV station management, coupled with utilities and other large organizations mandating their own adoption\nof specifications that have not become widely adopted in the industry, may hinder innovation or slow new product or new feature\nintroduction.\nIn\naddition, automobile manufacturers may choose to utilize their own proprietary systems, which could lock out competition for EV\ncharging stations, or to use their size and market position to influence the market, which could limit ChargePoint\u2019s market\nand reach to customers, negatively impacting its business.\nFurther,\nshould regulatory bodies later impose a standard that is not compatible with ChargePoint\u2019s infrastructure, it may incur\nsignificant costs to adapt its business model to the new regulatory standard, which may require significant time and, as a result,\nmay have a material adverse effect on its revenues or results of operations.\nChargePoint\u2019s\ntechnology could have undetected defects, errors or bugs in hardware or software which could reduce market adoption, damage its\nreputation with current or prospective customers, and/or expose it to product liability and other claims that could materially\nand adversely affect its business.\nChargePoint\nmay be subject to claims that charging stations have malfunctioned and persons were injured or purported to be injured. Any insurance\nthat ChargePoint carries may not be sufficient or it may not apply to all situations. Similarly, to the extent that such malfunctions\nare related to components obtained from third-party vendors, such vendors may not assume responsibility for such malfunctions.\nIn addition, ChargePoint\u2019s customers could be subjected to claims as a result of such incidents and may bring legal claims\nagainst ChargePoint to attempt to hold it liable. Any of these events could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s brand, relationships\nwith customers, operating results or financial condition.\nAcross\nChargePoint\u2019s product line, ChargePoint develops equipment solutions based on preferred second source or common off-the-shelf vendors.\nHowever, due to its designs, ChargePoint does rely on some single source vendors, the unavailability or failure of which can pose\nrisks to supply chain or product shipping situations.\nFurthermore,\nChargePoint\u2019s software platform is complex, developed for over a decade by many developers, and includes a number of licensed\nthird-party commercial and open-source software libraries. ChargePoint\u2019s software has contained defects and errors\nand may in the future contain undetected defects or errors. ChargePoint is continuing to evolve the features and functionality\nof its platform through updates and enhancements, and as it does, it may introduce additional defects or errors that may not be\ndetected until after deployment to customers. In addition, if ChargePoint\u2019s products and services, including any updates\nor patches, are not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruptions in service may result.\nAny\ndefects or errors in product or services offerings, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems\ncould result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business and results of its operations:\n\u25cf expenditure\nof significant financial and product development resources, including recalls, in efforts\nto analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u25cf loss\nof existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u25cf interruptions\nor delays in sales;\n\u25cf delayed\nor lost revenue;\n\u25cf delay\nor failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u25cf delay\nin the development or release of new functionality or improvements;\n\u25cf negative\npublicity and reputational harm;\n\u25cf sales\ncredits or refunds;\n\u25cf exposure\nof confidential or proprietary information;\n\u25cf diversion\nof development and customer service resources;\n\u25cf breach\nof warranty claims;\n\u25cf legal\nclaims under applicable laws, rules and regulations; and\n\u25cf an\nincrease in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nAlthough\nChargePoint has contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in many of its agreements\nwith customers, resellers and other business partners, such protections may not be uniformly implemented in all contracts and,\nwhere implemented, may not fully or effectively protect from claims by customers, reseller, business partners or other third parties.\nAny insurance coverage or indemnification obligations of suppliers may not adequately cover all such claims, or cover only a portion\nof such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim could have an adverse effect on ChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in\nexpenditure of funds in litigation, divert management\u2019s time and other resources and cause reputational harm.\nIn\naddition, ChargePoint relies on some open-source software and libraries issued under the General Public License (or similar\n\u201ccopyleft\u201d licenses) for development of its products and may continue to rely on similar copyleft licenses. Third-parties may\nassert a copyright claim against ChargePoint regarding its use of such software or libraries, which could lead to the adverse\nresults listed above. Use of such software or libraries may also force ChargePoint to provide third parties, at no cost, the source\ncode to its proprietary software, which may decrease revenue and lessen any competitive advantage ChargePoint has due to the secrecy\nof its source code.\nInterruptions,\ndelays in service or inability to increase capacity, including internationally, at third-party data center facilities could impair\nthe use or functionality of ChargePoint\u2019s subscription services, harm its business and subject it to liability.\nChargePoint\ncurrently serves customers from third-party data center facilities operated by Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) located\nin the United States, Europe and Canada. In addition to AWS, some ChargePoint services are housed in third-party data\ncenters operated by Rackspace in the United States. Any outage or failure of such data centers could negatively affect ChargePoint\u2019s\nproduct connectivity and performance. ChargePoint\u2019s primary environments are behind the Content Delivery Network operated\nby Cloudflare, and any interruptions of Cloudflare\u2019s services could negatively affect ChargePoint\u2019s product connectivity\nand performance. Furthermore, ChargePoint depends on connectivity from its charging stations to its data centers through cellular\nservice providers, such as Verizon Wireless. Any incident affecting a data center facility\u2019s or a cellular service provider\u2019s\ninfrastructure or operations, whether caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures,\nbreach of security protocols, computer viruses and disabling devices, failure of access control mechanisms, natural disasters,\nwar, criminal act, military actions, terrorist attacks and other similar events could negatively affect the use, functionality\nor availability of ChargePoint\u2019s services.\nAny\ndamage to, or failure of, ChargePoint\u2019s systems, or those of its third-party providers, could interrupt or hinder the\nuse or functionality of its services. Impairment of or interruptions in ChargePoint\u2019s services may reduce revenue, subject\nit to claims and litigation, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect renewal rates and its ability\nto attract new customers. ChargePoint\u2019s business will also be harmed if customers and potential customers believe its products\nand services are unreliable.\nChargePoint\nexpects to incur research and development costs and devote significant resources to developing new products, which could significantly\nreduce its profitability and may never result in revenue to ChargePoint.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfuture growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and customer requirements, and\nintroducing new products that achieve market acceptance. ChargePoint plans to incur significant research and development costs\nin the future as part of its efforts to design, develop, manufacture and introduce new products and enhance existing products.\nChargePoint\u2019s research and development expenses were $69.5 million, $50.5 million, $42.7 million and $54.1\nmillion during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively,\nand are likely to grow in the future. Further, ChargePoint\u2019s research and development program may not produce successful\nresults, and its new products may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable.\nCustomer-Related\nRisks\nChargePoint\nmay be unable to leverage customer data in all geographic locations, and this limitation may impact research and development operations.\nChargePoint\nrelies on data collected through charging stations or its mobile application, including usage data and geolocation data. ChargePoint\nuses this data in connection with the research, development and analysis of its technologies. ChargePoint\u2019s inability to\nobtain necessary rights to use this data or freely transfer this data out of, for example, the European Economic Area, could result\nin delays or otherwise negatively impact ChargePoint\u2019s research and development efforts.\nIf\nChargePoint fails to offer high-quality support to station owners and drivers, its business and reputation will suffer.\nOnce\na customer has installed ChargePoint charging stations and subscribed to ChargePoint\u2019s services, station owners and drivers\nwill rely on ChargePoint to provide support services to resolve any issues that might arise in the future. Rapid and high-quality customer\nsupport is important so station owners can provide charging services and drivers can receive reliable charging for their EVs.\nThe importance of high-quality customer support will increase as ChargePoint seeks to expand its business and pursue new\ncustomers and geographies. If ChargePoint does not quickly resolve issues and provide effective support, its ability to retain\ncustomers or sell additional products and services to existing customers could suffer and its brand and reputation could be harmed.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness will depend on customers renewing their services subscriptions. If customers do not continue to use its subscription\nofferings or if they fail to add more stations, its business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn\naddition to selling charging station hardware, ChargePoint also depends on customers continuing to subscribe to its EV charging\nservices and extended warranty coverages. Therefore, it is important that customers renew their subscriptions when the contract\nterm expires and add additional charging stations and services to their subscriptions. Customers may decide not to renew their\nsubscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices or terms or with the same or a greater number of users, stations\nor level of functionality. Customer retention may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including satisfaction\nwith software and features, functionality of the charging stations, prices, features and pricing of competing products, reductions\nin spending levels, mergers and acquisitions involving customers and deteriorating general economic conditions.\nIf\ncustomers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms or if they fail to add products or services,\nChargePoint\u2019s business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nChanges\nin subscriptions or pricing models may not be reflected in near-term operating results.\nChargePoint\ngenerally recognizes subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts. As a result, most of the subscription\nrevenue reported in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during\nprevious quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small\nimpact on revenue for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect revenue in future quarters. In addition, the\nseverity and duration of events may not be predictable and their effects could extend beyond a single quarter. Accordingly, the\neffect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of subscription services, and potential changes in pricing policies\nor rate of renewals, may not be fully apparent until future periods.\nFailure\nto effectively expand ChargePoint\u2019s sales and marketing capabilities could harm its ability to increase its customer base\nand achieve broader market acceptance of its solutions.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nability to grow its customer base, achieve broader market acceptance, grow revenue, and achieve and sustain profitability will\ndepend, to a significant extent, on its ability to effectively expand its sales and marketing operations and activities. Sales\nand marketing expenses represent a significant percentage of its total revenue, and its operating results will suffer if sales\nand marketing expenditures do not contribute significantly to increasing revenue.\nChargePoint\nis substantially dependent on its direct sales force to obtain new customers. ChargePoint plans to continue to expand its direct\nsales force both domestically and internationally but it may not be able to recruit and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel,\nwhich may adversely affect its ability to expand its sales capabilities. New hires require significant training and time before\nthey achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive\nas quickly as anticipated, and ChargePoint may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Furthermore,\nhiring sales personnel in new countries can be costly, complex and time-consuming, and requires additional set up and upfront\ncosts that may be disproportionate to the initial revenue expected from those countries. There is significant competition for\ndirect sales personnel with the strong sales skills and technical knowledge. ChargePoint\u2019s ability to achieve significant\nrevenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on its success in recruiting, training, incentivizing and retaining a\nsufficient number of qualified direct sales personnel and on such personnel attaining desired productivity levels within a reasonable\namount of time. ChargePoint\u2019s business will be harmed if continuing investment in its sales and marketing capabilities does\nnot generate a significant increase in revenue.\nFinancial,\nTax and Accounting-Related Risks\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations are likely to fluctuate on a quarterly basis in future periods, which could cause\nits results for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a decline in the price of the post-combination company\u2019s\ncommon stock.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a\nvariety of factors, many of which are beyond its control.\nIn\naddition to the other risks described herein, the following factors could also cause ChargePoint\u2019s financial condition and\nresults of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis:\n\u25cf the\ntiming and volume of new sales;\n\u25cf fluctuations\nin service costs, particularly due to unexpected costs of servicing and maintaining charging\nstations;\n\u25cf the\ntiming of new product introductions, which can initially have lower gross margins;\n\u25cf weaker\nthan anticipated demand for charging stations, whether due to changes in government incentives\nand policies or due to other conditions;\n\u25cf fluctuations\nin sales and marketing or research and development expenses;\n\u25cf supply\nchain interruptions and manufacturing or delivery delays;\n\u25cf the\ntiming and availability of new products relative to customers\u2019 and investors\u2019\nexpectations;\n\u25cf the\nlength of the sales and installation cycle for a particular customer;\n\u25cf the\nimpact of COVID-19 on ChargePoint\u2019s workforce, or those of its customers,\nsuppliers, vendors or business partners;\n\u25cf disruptions\nin sales, production, service or other business activities or ChargePoint\u2019s inability\nto attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf unanticipated\nchanges in federal, state, local or foreign government incentive programs, which can\naffect demand for EVs.\nFluctuations\nin operating results and cash flow could, among other things, give rise to short-term liquidity issues. In addition, revenue,\nand other operating results in future quarters may fall short of the expectations of investors and financial analysts, which could\nhave an adverse effect on the price of the common stock.\nChanges\nto applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect New ChargePoint\u2019s\nbusiness and future profitability.\nNew\nChargePoint is a U.S. corporation and thus subject to U.S. corporate income tax on its worldwide operations. Moreover, the majority\nof New ChargePoint\u2019s operations and customers are located in the United States, and as a result, New ChargePoint is\nsubject to various U.S. federal, state and local taxes. New U.S. laws and policy relating to taxes may have an adverse effect\non New ChargePoint\u2019s business and future profitability. Further, existing U.S. tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or\nordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to New ChargePoint.\nFor\nexample, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), was signed into law making\nsignificant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d),and certain provisions of the Tax\nAct may adversely affect New ChargePoint. In particular, sweeping changes were made to the U.S. taxation of foreign operations.\nChanges include, but are not limited to, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions,\na reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017, the\nelimination of carrybacks of net operating losses, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax\nor \u201ctoll-charge\u201d on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain\nanti-base erosion provisions, including a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income and base erosion and\nanti-abuse tax. The Tax Act could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, and is subject to interpretations\nand implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could\nmitigate or increase certain adverse effects of the legislation.\nIn\naddition to the impact of the Tax Act on New ChargePoint\u2019s federal taxes, the Tax Act may impact New ChargePoint\u2019s\ntaxation in other jurisdictions, including with respect to state income taxes as state legislatures have not had sufficient time\nto respond to the Tax Act. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to how the laws will apply in the various state jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, other foreign governing bodies may enact changes to their tax laws in reaction to the Tax Act that could result\nin changes to New ChargePoint\u2019s global tax position and materially adversely affect its business and future profitability.\nAs\na result of New ChargePoint\u2019s plans to expand operations, including to jurisdictions in which the tax laws may not be favorable,\nNew ChargePoint\u2019s tax rate may fluctuate, tax obligations may become significantly more complex and subject to greater risk\nof examination by taxing authorities or New ChargePoint may be subject to future changes in tax law, the impacts of which could\nadversely affect New ChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial results.\nBecause\nChargePoint does not have a long history of operating at its present scale and it has significant expansion plans, New ChargePoint\u2019s\neffective tax rate may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by operating losses in jurisdictions\nwhere no tax benefit can be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d), changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, or changes in tax laws. Factors that could materially affect New ChargePoint\u2019s future effective tax rates include,\nbut are not limited to: (a) changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment, (b) changes in accounting and tax standards\nor practices, (c) changes in the composition of operating income by tax jurisdiction and (d) New ChargePoint\u2019s\noperating results before taxes.\nAdditionally,\nafter the Business Combination, New ChargePoint\u2019s operations will be subject to significant income, withholding and other\ntax obligations in the United States and may become subject to taxes in numerous additional state, local and non-U.S. jurisdictions\nwith respect to its income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. New ChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability\nand financial results could be subject to volatility or be affected by numerous factors, including (a) the availability of\ntax deductions, credits, exemptions, refunds (including refunds of value added taxes) and other benefits to reduce New ChargePoint\u2019s\ntax liabilities, (b) changes in the valuation of New ChargePoint\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, (c) expected\ntiming and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances, (d) tax treatment of stock-based compensation, (e) changes\nin the relative amount of New ChargePoint\u2019s earnings subject to tax in the various jurisdictions in which New ChargePoint\noperates or has subsidiaries, (f) the potential expansion of New ChargePoint\u2019s business into or otherwise becoming\nsubject to tax in additional jurisdictions, (g) changes to New ChargePoint\u2019s existing intercompany structure (and any\ncosts related thereto) and business operations, (h) the extent of New ChargePoint\u2019s intercompany transactions and the\nextent to which taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions respect those intercompany transactions and (i) New ChargePoint\u2019s\nability to structure New ChargePoint\u2019s operations in an efficient and competitive manner. Due to the complexity of multinational\ntax obligations and filings, New ChargePoint may have a heightened risk related to audits or examinations by U.S. federal, state,\nlocal and non-U.S. taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits or examinations could have an adverse effect on New ChargePoint\u2019s\nafter-tax profitability and financial condition. Additionally, the IRS and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly\nfocused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and services and the use of intangibles.\nTax authorities could disagree with ChargePoint\u2019s intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other\nmatters and assess additional taxes. If ChargePoint does not prevail in any such disagreements, its profitability may be affected.\nNew\nChargePoint\u2019s after-tax profitability and financial results may also be adversely impacted by changes in the relevant\ntax laws and tax rates, treaties, regulations, administrative practices and principles, judicial decisions and interpretations\nthereof, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related\nMeasures to Prevent BEPS recently entered into force among the jurisdictions that have ratified it, although the United States\nhas not yet entered into this convention. These recent changes could negatively impact New ChargePoint\u2019s taxation, especially\nas New ChargePoint expands its relationships and operations internationally.\nThe\nability of New ChargePoint to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards following the Business Combination\nis conditioned upon New ChargePoint attaining profitability and generating taxable income. ChargePoint has incurred significant\nnet losses since inception and it is anticipated that New ChargePoint will continue to incur significant losses. Additionally,\nNew ChargePoint\u2019s ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may\nbe limited.\nAs\nof January 31, 2020, ChargePoint had $404.3 million of U.S. federal and $224.1 million of California net operating\nloss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, of which $264.6 million of the U.S. federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. federal and California state net operating loss carryforwards begin\nto expire in 2028, and alternative refueling property tax credits of $1.4 million begin to expire in 2030. In addition, ChargePoint\nhad net operating loss carryforwards for other states of $102.7 million, which begin to expire in 2022. The Tax Act included\na reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017 and\nthe elimination of carrybacks of net operating losses. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES\nAct, which modified the Tax Act, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31,\n2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning\nafter December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is possible that New ChargePoint will not generate taxable\nincome in time to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax\ncredits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code, respectively, and similar\nprovisions of state law. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s\nability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax\ncredits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur\nif there is a cumulative change in ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling\nthree-year period. If ChargePoint has experienced an ownership change at any time since its incorporation, New ChargePoint\nmay already be subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes\nto offset taxable income or tax liability. In addition, the Business Combination, and future changes in New ChargePoint\u2019s\nstock ownership, which may be outside of New ChargePoint\u2019s control, may trigger an ownership change. Similar provisions\nof state tax law may also apply to limit New ChargePoint\u2019s use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if\nNew ChargePoint earns net taxable income in the future, its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards\nand other tax attributes to offset such taxable income or tax liability may be subject to limitations, which could potentially\nresult in increased future income tax liability to New ChargePoint.\nChargePoint\nhas not conducted a study to assess whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred since inception. If ChargePoint has\nexperienced an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, at any time since inception, utilization\nof the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation\nunder Section 382 of the Code, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the ChargePoint\u2019s stock at the time\nof the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments,\nas required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development\ntax credit carryforwards before utilization. In addition, the Business Combination if consummated, may constitute an ownership\nchange under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. ChargePoint\u2019s net operating losses or credits may also be impaired under\nstate law. Accordingly, ChargePoint may not be able to utilize a material portion of the net operating losses or credits. The\nability of New ChargePoint to utilize ChargePoint\u2019s net operating losses or credits following the Business Combination is\nconditioned upon New ChargePoint attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal and state taxable income. ChargePoint has\nincurred significant net losses since inception and will continue to incur significant losses; and therefore, ChargePoint does\nnot know whether or when the combined carryforwards may be or may become subject to limitation by Sections 382 and 383 of the\nCode.\nChargePoint\u2019s\nreported financial results may be negatively impacted by changes in U.S. GAAP.\nU.S.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards\nCodification, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting\nof transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.\nNew\nChargePoint will be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable\nto emerging growth companies will make the post-combination company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors and may\nmake it more difficult to compare performance with other public companies.\nNew\nChargePoint will be an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and it intends to take advantage of certain exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements\nof holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved. Investors may find the common stock less attractive because New ChargePoint will continue to rely on these\nexemptions. If some investors find the common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for\ntheir common stock, and the stock price may be more volatile.\nAn\nemerging growth company may elect to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards. With Switchback making this election,\nSection 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act allows New ChargePoint to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those\nstandards apply to non-public business entities. As a result, the financial statements contained in the proxy statement/prospectus/consent\nsolicitation statement related to the Business Combination and those that New ChargePoint will file in the future may not be comparable\nto companies that comply with public business entities revised accounting standards effective dates.\nNew\nChargePoint will incur significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have an adverse\neffect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew\nChargePoint will face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that it did\nnot incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules\nand regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010\nand the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the\n\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the securities exchanges, impose additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance\nwith public company requirements will increase costs and make certain activities more time-consuming. A number of those requirements\nrequire it to carry out activities ChargePoint has not done previously. In addition, expenses associated with SEC reporting requirements\nwill be incurred. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified (for example, if the auditors\nidentify a significant deficiency or additional material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting), New ChargePoint\ncould incur additional costs to rectify those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect its reputation\nor investor perceptions. In addition, New ChargePoint will purchase director and officer liability insurance, which has substantial\nadditional premiums. The additional reporting and other obligations imposed by these rules and regulations increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. Advocacy efforts by stockholders\nand third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance and reporting requirements, which could further increase costs.\nChargePoint\nhas identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If ChargePoint is unable to remediate these\nmaterial weaknesses, or if ChargePoint identifies additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fails to maintain\nan effective system of internal control over financial reporting, this may result in material misstatements of ChargePoint\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements or cause ChargePoint to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations.\nAs\na public company, New ChargePoint will be required to provide management\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial\nreporting. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the\nincreased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that will be applicable after the Business Combination. If ChargePoint\nis not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner\nor with adequate compliance, it may not be able to assess whether its internal control over financial reporting is effective,\nwhich may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence.\nIn\nconnection with the preparation and audit of ChargePoint\u2019s consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2020\nand 2019 and for the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, material weaknesses were identified in its internal control\nover financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of ChargePoint\u2019s annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nChargePoint\ndid not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically,\nChargePoint did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate degree of accounting knowledge, experience\nand training to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters commensurate with its accounting and reporting requirements.\nThis material weakness contributed to the following additional two material weaknesses:\n\u25cf ChargePoint\ndid not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls over\nsignificant accounts and disclosures to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial\naccounting, reporting and disclosures, including segregation of duties and adequate controls\nrelated to the preparation and review of journal entries; and\n\u25cf ChargePoint\ndid not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology (\u201cIT\u201d)\ngeneral controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its\nconsolidated financial statements. Specifically, ChargePoint did not design and maintain\n(a) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program\nand data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records\nare identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately and (b) user access\ncontrols to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user\nand privileged access to its financial applications and data to appropriate company personnel.\nThe\nmaterial weakness related to formal accounting policies, procedures and controls resulted in adjustments to several accounts and\ndisclosures. The IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements, however,\nthe deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls\n(such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls\nand underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements\npotentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Each of these\nmaterial weaknesses could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement\nto the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nChargePoint\nhas begun implementation of a plan to remediate these material weaknesses. These remediation measures are ongoing and include\nhiring additional accounting and financial reporting personnel and implementing additional policies, procedures and controls.\nIn\norder to maintain and improve the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, ChargePoint has expended, and\nanticipates that New ChargePoint will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant\nmanagement oversight. New ChargePoint\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest\nto the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting until after it is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d\nas defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, New ChargePoint\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which its internal control over financial reporting is documented,\ndesigned or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could\nadversely affect the business and operating results after the Business Combination and could cause a decline in the price of New\nChargePoint Class A common stock.\nRisks\nRelated to Legal Matters and Regulations\nPrivacy\nconcerns and laws, or other domestic or foreign regulations, may adversely affect ChargePoint\u2019s business.\nNational\nand local governments and agencies in the countries in which ChargePoint operates and in which customers operate have adopted,\nare considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, processing and disclosure\nof information regarding consumers and other individuals, which could impact its ability to offer services in certain jurisdictions.\nLaws and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, security and other processing of individuals\u2019 information\ncan vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are particularly stringent in Europe. The costs of compliance with,\nand other burdens imposed by, laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity are significant. In addition, some companies, particularly larger enterprises, often will not contract with vendors that\ndo not meet these rigorous standards. Accordingly, the failure, or perceived inability, to comply with these laws, regulations,\nstandards and other obligations may limit the use and adoption of ChargePoint\u2019s solutions, reduce overall demand, lead to\nregulatory investigations, litigation and significant fines, penalties or liabilities for actual or alleged noncompliance, or\nslow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm its business. Moreover, if ChargePoint or any of its\nemployees or contractors fail or are believed to fail to adhere to appropriate practices regarding customers\u2019 data, it may\ndamage its reputation and brand.\nAdditionally,\nexisting laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may be interpreted in new and differing manners in the future, and\nmay be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation\nof existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could result in increased regulation, increased costs of compliance\nand penalties for non-compliance, and limitations on data collection, use, disclosure and transfer for ChargePoint and its customers.\nThe EU and United States agreed in 2016 to a framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, but this\nframework has been challenged and recently declared invalid by the Court of Justice of the EU, thereby creating additional legal\nrisk for ChargePoint. Additionally, the EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR establishes\nrequirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of\n\u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR may limit\nthe use and adoption of ChargePoint\u2019s products and services and could have an adverse impact on its business. Further, California\nadopted the California Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the California State Attorney General has begun enforcement actions.\nThe\ncosts of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity that are applicable to the businesses of customers may adversely affect ability and willingness to process, handle, store,\nuse and transmit certain types of information, such as demographic and other personal information. In addition, the other bases\non which ChargePoint and its customers rely for the transfer of personal data across national borders, such as the Standard Contractual\nClauses promulgated by the EU Commission Decision 2010/87/EU, commonly referred to as the Model Clauses, continue to be subjected\nto regulatory and judicial scrutiny. If ChargePoint or its customers are unable to transfer data between and among countries and\nregions in which it operates, it could decrease demand for its products and services or require it to modify or restrict some\nof its products or services.\nIn\naddition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups, the technology industry and other industries have established or may\nestablish various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on technology\ncompanies. Customers may expect that ChargePoint will meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by\nthem or third parties. If ChargePoint is unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand\nfor its solutions and adversely affect its business.\nFailure\nto comply with anticorruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with activities outside\nof the United States, could subject ChargePoint to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nChargePoint\nis subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT\nAct, the UK Bribery Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which it conducts\nactivities. It faces significant risks if it fails to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies\nand their employees and third-party intermediaries from promising, authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly,\nimproper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose\nof obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage. Any violation of the FCPA, other\napplicable anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a materially adverse\neffect on New ChargePoint\u2019s reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement\naction may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other\nprofessional fees.\nFailure\nto comply with laws relating to employment could subject ChargePoint to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nChargePoint\nis subject to various employment-related laws in the jurisdictions in which its employees are based. It faces risks if it\nfails to comply with applicable United States federal or state wage laws, or wage laws applicable to its employees outside\nof the United States. In addition, ChargePoint implemented a reduction in force and furloughed employees in 2020, and the\nattendant layoffs and/or furloughs could create an additional risk of claims being made on behalf of affected employees. Any violation\nof applicable wage laws or other labor- or employment-related laws could result in complaints by current or former employees,\nadverse media coverage, investigations and damages or penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on New ChargePoint\u2019s\nreputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any such proceeding may result in a significant\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nExisting\nand future environmental health and safety laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating\ncosts or construction costs and restrictions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in substantial fines\nor other limitations that may adversely impact ChargePoint\u2019s financial results or results of operation.\nChargePoint\nand its operations, as well as those of ChargePoint\u2019s contractors, suppliers and customers, are subject to certain environmental\nlaws and regulations, including laws related to the use, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances\nand wastes as well as electronic wastes and hardware, whether hazardous or not. These laws may require ChargePoint or others in\nChargePoint\u2019s value chain to obtain permits and comply with procedures that impose various restrictions and obligations\nthat may have material effects on ChargePoint\u2019s operations. If key permits and approvals cannot be obtained on acceptable\nterms, or if other operational requirements cannot be met in a manner satisfactory for ChargePoint\u2019s operations or on a\ntimeline that meets ChargePoint\u2019s commercial obligations, it may adversely impact our business.\nEnvironmental\nand health and safety laws and regulations can be complex and may be subject to change, such as through new requirements enacted\nat the supranational, national, sub-national and/or local level or new or modified regulations that may be implemented under\nexisting law. The nature and extent of any changes in these laws, rules, regulations and permits may be unpredictable and may\nhave material effects on ChargePoint\u2019s business. Future legislation and regulations or changes in existing legislation and\nregulations, or interpretations thereof, including those relating to hardware manufacturing, electronic waste or batteries, could\ncause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with ChargePoint\u2019s operations as well as other future\nprojects, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFurther,\nChargePoint currently relies on third parties to ensure compliance with certain environmental laws, including those related to\nthe disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Any failure to properly handle or dispose of such wastes, regardless\nof whether such failure is ChargePoint\u2019s or its contractors, may result in liability under environmental laws, including,\nbut not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, under which liability may be imposed\nwithout regard to fault or degree of contribution for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, as well as impacts\nto human health and damages to natural resources. Additionally, ChargePoint may not be able to secure contracts with third parties\nto continue their key supply chain and disposal services for our business, which may result in increased costs for compliance\nwith environmental laws and regulations.\nRisks\nRelating to Ownership of the Common Stock after the Closing of the Business Combination\nConcentration\nof ownership among ChargePoint\u2019s existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from\ninfluencing significant corporate decisions.\nAfter\ngiving effect to the Closing and the PIPE Financing and assuming no redemptions of Class A common stock, New ChargePoint\u2019s\ndirectors, executive officers and their affiliates as a group will beneficially own approximately 65.6% of the outstanding New\nChargePoint Class A common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over\nall matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any amendment of the certificate of incorporation\nand approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control\nor changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these\nstockholders.\nChargePoint\nhas never paid cash dividends on its capital stock, and New ChargePoint does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nChargePoint\nhas never paid cash dividends on its capital stock and currently intends to retain any future earnings to fund the growth of its\nbusiness. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend\non financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that the board\nmay deem relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of New ChargePoint\u2019s Class A common stock will be the\nsole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe\nstock price following the closing of the Business Combination will be volatile, and you may not be able to sell shares at or above\nthe price at the Closing.\nAfter\nthe closing of the Business Combination, the trading price of the Class A common stock and warrants will be volatile and\ncould be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond New ChargePoint\u2019s control.\nThese factors include:\n\u25cf actual\nor anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u25cf failure\nto meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or\nthat New ChargePoint provides to the public;\n\u25cf issuance\nof new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations\nfor the industry in general;\n\u25cf announcements\nof significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or\ncapital commitments;\n\u25cf operating\nand share price performance of other companies in the industry or related markets;\n\u25cf the\ntiming and magnitude of investments in the growth of the business;\n\u25cf actual\nor anticipated changes in laws and regulations;\n\u25cf additions\nor departures of key management or other personnel;\n\u25cf increased\nlabor costs;\n\u25cf disputes\nor other developments related to intellectual property or other proprietary rights, including\nlitigation;\n\u25cf the\nability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n\u25cf sales\nof substantial amounts of the Class A common stock by the New ChargePoint board\nof directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such\nsales could occur;\n\u25cf changes\nin capital structure, including future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\nand\n\u25cf general\neconomic, political and market conditions.\nIn\naddition, the stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price\nand volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad\nmarket and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of New ChargePoint Class A common stock, regardless of actual\noperating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of\na particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies.\nThis litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAnti-takeover\nprovisions contained in the post-Closing governing documents and applicable laws could impair a takeover attempt.\nUpon\nthe closing of the Business Combination, New ChargePoint\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws will afford certain rights\nand powers to the New ChargePoint board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it\ndeems undesirable. New ChargePoint is also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions\nof Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. Any of the\nforegoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for\nstockholders to receive a premium for their shares of their Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some\ninvestors are willing to pay for the Class A common stock.\nThe\npost-Closing certificate of incorporation will provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit stockholders\u2019\nability to obtain a more favorable judicial forum for disputes with New ChargePoint or its directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nThe\npost-Closing certificate of incorporation will require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought\nin name of New ChargePoint, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions\nmay be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another\nfederal or state court situated in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest\nin shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws will provide that the federal district courts of the United States\nshall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act and the\nExchange Act.\nIn\nMarch 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi, which found that\nan exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under\nDelaware law. It is unclear whether this decision will be appealed, or what the final outcome of this case will be. New ChargePoint\nintends to enforce this provision, but it does not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or\nenforce it.\nThis\nchoice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable\nfor disputes with New ChargePoint or any of its directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits\nwith respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the certificate\nof incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, New ChargePoint may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks\nRelated to Switchback\nRisks\nRelated to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nThe\nrisks discussed herein have been identified by our management based on an evaluation of the historical risks faced by ChargePoint\nand relate to our management\u2019s current expectations as to future risks that may result from our anticipated ownership and\noperation of ChargePoint.\nThe\nloss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully effect the Business Combination\nand successfully operate the business thereafter.\nOur\nability to successfully effect the Business Combination and successfully operate the business is dependent upon the services of\nour senior management and technical personnel. While we have scrutinized the individuals who will stay with us following the Business\nCombination, our assessment of these individuals may not prove to be correct. We do not plan to obtain any insurance against the\nloss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Switchback will also be dependent, in part, upon\nChargePoint\u2019s technical personnel in connection with operating the business following the Business Combination. A loss by\nChargePoint of its technical personnel could seriously harm Switchback\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThere\nare inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm Switchback\u2019s\nbusiness may occur and not be detected.\nOur\nmanagement does not expect that our internal and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control\nsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of\nthe control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints\nand the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation\nof controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in Switchback\nhave been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and\nthat breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of\nsome persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions\nabout the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals\nunder all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements\ndue to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Switchback will also be dependent, in part, upon ChargePoint\u2019s internal\ncontrol. A failure of Switchback\u2019s or ChargePoint\u2019s controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously\nharm Switchback\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSwitchback\u2019s\nbusiness could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions.\nWe\ndepend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those\nof third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks by cyberattackers on, or security breaches in, our\nsystems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation\nof our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments\nin data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources\nto adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any\nof these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business, lead to financial loss and negative\npublicity. Switchback will also be dependent, in part, upon ChargePoint\u2019s information. A failure in the security of ChargePoint\u2019s\ninformation systems could seriously harm Switchback\u2019s business and results of operations.\nWe\nhave not registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or\nany state securities laws, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding\nsuch investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire\nworthless.\nWe\nhave not registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or\nany state securities laws. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement governing the terms of our warrants, we have agreed\nthat as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of an initial business combination,\nwe will use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares. We will use our best\nefforts to cause the same to become effective, but in no event later than 60 business days after the Closing, and to maintain\nthe effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants\nin accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example,\nany facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus,\nthe financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order.\nIf the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit\nholders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis,\nand we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares\nupon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption\nfrom registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of\na warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d\nunder Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their\nwarrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect,\nwe will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will be required to use our best efforts\nto register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will\nwe be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event\nthat we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities\nlaws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration\nor qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value\nand expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full\nunit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. If and when the warrants become\nredeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Class A\ncommon stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRisks\nRelated to Switchback and the Business Combination\nFollowing\nthe consummation of the Business Combination, our sole material asset will be our direct equity interest in ChargePoint and we\nwill be accordingly dependent upon distributions from ChargePoint to pay taxes and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses\nand pay dividends, if any, on our common stock.\nWe\nare a holding company and, subsequent to the completion of the Business Combination, will have no material assets other than our\ndirect equity interest in ChargePoint. We will have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent ChargePoint has\navailable cash, we will cause ChargePoint to make distributions of cash to us to pay taxes, cover our corporate and other overhead\nexpenses and pay dividends, if any, on our common stock. To the extent that we need funds and ChargePoint fails to generate sufficient\ncash flow to distribute funds to us or is restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation\nor under the terms of its financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, our liquidity and financial condition\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nSubsequent\nto the consummation of the Business Combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment\nor other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price,\nwhich could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough\nwe have conducted due diligence on ChargePoint, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may\nbe present in ChargePoint, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence,\nor that factors outside of our control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets,\nrestructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully\nidentifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with\nour preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our\nliquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us following the\ncompletion of the Business Combination or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain\nfuture financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur\ninitial stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\nUnlike\nmany other blank check companies in which the founders agree to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the\nvotes cast by public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination, our initial stockholders have agreed to\nvote any shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock owned by them in favor of the Business Combination.\nAs of the date hereof, our initial stockholders own shares equal to approximately 20.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock in the aggregate. Accordingly, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder\napproval will be received for the Business Combination than would be the case if the initial stockholders agreed to vote any shares\nof Class A common stock and Class B common stock owned by them in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by\nour public stockholders.\nOur\nSponsor, certain members of our board of directors and our officers have interests in the Business Combination that are different\nfrom or are in addition to other stockholders in recommending that stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination\nproposal.\nOur\nboard of directors has unanimously approved the Business Combination Agreement and related transactions and the other proposals\ndescribed in the proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement related to the Business Combination. Further, our board\nof directors has determined that it is advisable to consummate the Business Combination and has recommended that our stockholders\nvote \u201cFOR\u201d the approval of the Business Combination Agreement. When considering our board\u2019s recommendation that\nour stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the Business Combination proposal, our stockholders should be aware that our\ndirectors and officers have interests in the Business Combination that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests\nof our stockholders. These interests include:\n\u25cf the\nfact that our Sponsor holds 5,521,568 private placement warrants that would expire worthless\nif a Business Combination is not consummated;\n\u25cf the\nfact that our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to redeem any of the shares\nof our common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the\nBusiness Combination;\n\u25cf the\nfact that our Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for the Founder Shares, including\n120,000 Founder Shares which were subsequently transferred to our independent directors,\nand that such securities will have a significantly higher value at the time of the Business\nCombination, which if unrestricted and freely tradable would be valued at approximately\n$240,044,813, based on the closing price of our Class A common stock of $34.95 per\nshare on December 16, 2020 (after giving effect to the forfeiture of Founder Shares\ncontemplated by the Founders Stock Letter and not taking into account the Founder Earn\nBack Shares);\n\u25cf if\nthe Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event we are unable to complete an\ninitial business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor has agreed\nto indemnify us to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below\n$10.00 per public share, or such lesser amount per public share as is in the Trust Account\non the liquidation date, by the claims of (a) any third party (other than our independent\nregistered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us or (b) a\nprospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality\nor other similar agreement or business combination agreement, but only if such a third\nparty or target business has not executed a waiver of all rights to seek access to the\nTrust Account;\n\u25cf the\nfact that our independent directors own an aggregate of 120,000 Founder Shares that were\ntransferred from our Sponsor, which if unrestricted and freely tradeable would be valued\nat approximately $4,194,000, based on the closing price of our Class A common stock\nof $34.95 per share on December 16, 2020 (after giving effect to the forfeiture\nof Founder Shares contemplated by the Founders Stock Letter);\n\u25cf the\nfact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses\nincurred in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target\nbusinesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations; and\n\u25cf the\nfact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us\nif an initial business combination is not completed.\nOur\nboard of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in reaching the determination to approve\nthe Business Combination and the Business Combination Agreement and in recommending that the holders of our common stock vote\nto approve the Business Combination and adopt the Business Combination Agreement.\nOur\ninitial stockholders hold a significant number of shares of our common stock and our Sponsor holds a significant number of our\nwarrants. They will lose their entire investment in us if we do not complete an initial business combination.\nOur\nSponsor and our independent directors hold all of our 7,852,941 Founder Shares, representing 20% of the total outstanding shares\nupon completion of our Public Offering. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination\nby July 30, 2021. In addition, our Sponsor holds an aggregate of 5,521,568 private placement warrants that will also be worthless\nif we do not complete an initial business combination by July 30, 2021.\nThe\nFounder Shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units, except that (a) the Founder\nShares and the shares of Class A common stock into which the Founder Shares convert upon an initial business combination\nare subject to certain transfer restrictions, (b) our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement\nwith us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and\nany public shares they own in connection with the completion of an initial business combination and (ii) to waive their rights\nto liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business\ncombination by July 30, 2021 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect\nto any public shares they hold if we fail to complete an initial business combination by July 30, 2021) and (c) the\nFounder Shares are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of an initial business combination.\nThe\npersonal and financial interests of our Sponsor, officers and directors may have influenced their motivation in identifying and\nselecting the business combination, completing the business combination and influencing our operation following the business combination.\nWe\nwill incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination.\nWe\nhave and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination. All expenses\nincurred in connection with the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination, including all legal, accounting,\nconsulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be for the account of the party incurring such fees, expenses\nand costs; provided, that, our Sponsor has agreed to pay any Switchback Transaction Costs (as defined in the Registration Statement)\n(excluding any PIPE Financing Transaction Costs (as defined in the Registration Statement)) in excess of the Switchback Transaction\nCosts Cap (as defined in the Registration Statement), and all other Switchback Transaction Costs will be borne by us. Our transaction\nexpenses as a result of the Business Combination are currently estimated at approximately $29.5 million, including approximately\n$10.9 million in deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters of our Public Offering.\nWe\nmay be subject to business uncertainties while the Business Combination is pending.\nUncertainty\nabout the effect of the Business Combination on employees and third parties may have an adverse effect on ChargePoint and consequently,\non Switchback. These uncertainties may impair ChargePoint\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could\ncause third parties that deal with ChargePoint to defer entering into contracts or making other decisions or seek to change existing\nbusiness relationships. If key employees depart because of issues relating to such uncertainty or a desire not to remain with\nthe business, ChargePoint\u2019s business following the Business Combination could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Business\nCombination Agreement restricts ChargePoint from making certain expenditures and taking other specified actions without the consent\nof Switchback until the Business Combination occurs. These restrictions may prevent ChargePoint from pursuing attractive business\nopportunities that may arise prior to the Closing.\nThe\nconsummation of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions and if those conditions are not satisfied or waived,\nthe Business Combination Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Business Combination may not be completed.\nThe\nBusiness Combination Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Business\nCombination. Those conditions include: (a) approval by our stockholders and ChargePoint\u2019s stockholders, (b) Switchback having\nat least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as of the effective time of the consummation of the Business Combination, (c) the expiration\nor termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, (d) the listing of the shares\nof Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the Closing and the PIPE Financing on the NYSE (or another national securities\nexchange mutually agreed by the parties to the Business Combination Agreement) and the effectiveness of the Registration Statement\nand (e) the amount of Switchback Cash (as defined in the Registration Statement) minus (x) the aggregate amount of cash proceeds\nthat will be required to satisfy redemptions of public shares by our public stockholders in accordance with our organizational\ndocuments, if any, minus (y) the amount of Switchback Transaction Costs that remain unpaid immediately prior to the Closing (excluding,\nfor the avoidance of doubt, any Switchback Transaction Costs payable by our Sponsor in accordance with the Business Combination\nAgreement), equaling at least $300,000,000. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination\nAgreement at any time, before or after stockholder approval, or Switchback or ChargePoint may elect to terminate the Business\nCombination Agreement in certain other circumstances.\nWe\nmay waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination.\nWe\nmay agree to waive, in whole or in part, one or more of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Business Combination,\nto the extent permitted by our Charter, bylaws and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition to our obligation to close\nthe Business Combination that certain of ChargePoint\u2019s representations and warranties be true and correct in all material\nrespects as of the date of the Business Combination Agreement and the Effective Time. However, if our board of directors determines\nthat it is in the best interests of Switchback to proceed with the Business Combination, then our board of directors may elect\nto waive that condition and close the Business Combination.\nIf\nwe are unable to complete an initial business combination on or prior to July 30, 2021, our public stockholders may receive only\napproximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account (or less than $10.00 per share in certain circumstances\nwhere a third party brings a claim against us that our Sponsor is unable to indemnify), and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf\nwe are unable to complete an initial business combination on or prior to July 30, 2021, our public stockholders may receive\nonly approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account (or less than $10.00 per share in certain circumstances\nwhere a third party brings a claim against us that our Sponsor is unable to indemnify (as described below)), and our warrants\nwill expire worthless.\nIf\nthird parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in our Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount\nreceived by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nOur\nplacing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek\nto have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses\nand other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind\nin or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements,\nor even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including,\nbut not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging\nthe enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including\nthe funds held in the Trust Account. Although no third parties have refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the\nmonies held in the Trust Account to date, if any third party refuses to execute such an agreement in the future, our management\nwill perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has\nnot executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to\nus than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive\nto them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential\ntarget businesses that we might pursue.\nExamples\nof possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant\nwhose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that\nwould agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of,\nor arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for\nany reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our Business Combination within the prescribed\ntimeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our Business Combination, we will be required to provide\nfor payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption.\nAccordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share\ninitially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and\nto the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered\nor products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or\nother similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser\nof (a) $10.00 per public share and (b) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account, if less than $10.00\nper share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, in each case\nincluding interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income\ntaxes, less franchise and income taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or\nprospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not\nsuch waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against\ncertain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such\nindemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity\nobligations and we believe that our Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you\nthat our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the\nTrust Account, the funds available for an initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per\npublic share. In such event, we may not be able to complete an initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser\namount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us\nfor claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nLegal\nproceedings in connection with the Business Combination, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion\nof the Business Combination.\nOn\nOctober 29, 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a purported\nSwitchback stockholder in connection with the Business Combination: Bulsa v. Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation,\net al., Index No. 655800/2020 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty.). Separately, on November 6, 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was\nfiled in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a different purported Switchback stockholder in connection with the\nBusiness Combination: Bushansky v. Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation, et al., Index No. 656119/2020 (Sup.\nCt. N.Y. Cnty.). Additionally, on December 15, 2020, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York by a purported Switchback stockholder in connection with the Business Combination: Ward v. Switchback\nEnergy Acquisition Corporation, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-10577 (S.D.N.Y.). On December 16, 2020,\na separate complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a purported Switchback stockholder in connection\nwith the Business Combination: Baker v. Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation, et al., Index No. 657063/2020\n(Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty.) (collectively, the \u201cComplaints\u201d). The Complaints name Switchback and current members of our\nboard as defendants. The Complaints allege, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty claims against our board in connection\nwith the Business Combination. The Complaints also allege that the proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement related\nto the Business Combination is materially misleading and/or omits material information concerning the Business Combination, including,\nwith respect to the Federal Complaint (as defined below), in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Complaints\ngenerally seek injunctive relief, unspecified damages and awards of attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees, among other remedies.\nAdditional\nlawsuits may be filed against Switchback or our directors and officers in connection with the Business Combination. Defending\nsuch additional lawsuits could require Switchback to incur significant costs and draw the attention of our management team away\nfrom the Business Combination. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time\nthe Business Combination is consummated may adversely affect New ChargePoint\u2019s business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. Such legal proceedings could also delay or prevent the Business Combination from becoming effective\nwithin the completed timeframe.\nOur\ndirectors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of\nfunds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn\nthe event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (a) $10.00 per public share and (b) the\nactual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than\n$10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case including interest earned on the funds held\nin the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, less franchise and income taxes\npayable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related\nto a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its\nindemnification obligations.\nWhile\nwe currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification\nobligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary\nduties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification\nobligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below\n$10.00 per share.\nWe\nmay not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and officers.\nWe\nhave agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors\nhave agreed, and any persons who may become officers or directors prior to an initial business combination will agree, to waive\nany right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and to not seek recourse against the\nTrust Account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if\n(a) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (b) we consummate an initial business combination. Our\nobligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or\ndirectors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative\nlitigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nFurthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage\nawards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nIf,\nafter we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary\nbankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members\nof our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members\nof our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf,\nafter we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary\nbankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under\napplicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d\nAs a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board\nmay be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself\nand us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf,\nbefore distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary\nbankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over\nthe claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with\nour liquidation may be reduced.\nIf,\nbefore distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary\nbankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable\nbankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the\nclaims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would\notherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nEven\nif we consummate the Business Combination, there is no guarantee that the public warrants will be in the money at the time they\nbecome exercisable, and they may expire worthless.\nThe\nexercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per share of Class A common stock. There is no guarantee that the public warrants\nwill be in the money following the time they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire\nworthless.\nWe\nmay amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders\nof at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of the warrants could be increased, the\nexercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant\ncould be decreased, all without a holder\u2019s approval.\nOur\nwarrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,\nas warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of\nany holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50%\nof the then-outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders\nof public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at\nleast 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the\npublic warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments\ncould be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock\n(at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our Class A\ncommon stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nWe\nmay redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to warrant holders, thereby making their\nwarrants worthless.\nWe\nhave the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a\nprice of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00\nper share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading\ndays within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such\nredemption and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our\nredemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities\nlaws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (a) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor\nat a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (b) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price\nwhen you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (c) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the\noutstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None\nof the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us for cash so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nIn\naddition, we may redeem your warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of Class A common stock determined\nbased on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A common stock. Any such redemption may have similar\nconsequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money,\u201d\nin which case you would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Class A common stock\nhad your warrants remained outstanding.\nBecause\ncertain of our shares of Class A common stock and warrants currently trade as units consisting of one share of Class A\ncommon stock and one-third of one warrant, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach\nunit contains one-third of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation\nof the units, and only whole warrants will trade. This is different from other blank check companies similar to ours whose units\ninclude one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one whole share. This unit structure may cause our units to be worth\nless than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in\norder to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of an initial business combination since the warrants will\nbe exercisable in the aggregate for one-third of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant\nto purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this\nunit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nWe\nmay issue additional common stock or preferred stock to complete the Business Combination or under an employee incentive plan\nafter completion of the Business Combination. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present\nother risks.\nWe\nmay issue a substantial number of additional shares of common or preferred stock to complete the Business Combination or under\nan employee incentive plan after completion of the Business Combination. The issuance of additional shares of common or preferred\nstock:\n\u25cf may\nsignificantly dilute the equity interests of our investors;\n\u25cf may\nsubordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights\nsenior to those afforded our common stock;\n\u25cf could\ncause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued,\nwhich may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry\nforwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers\nand directors; and\n\u25cf may\nadversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A common stock and/or\nwarrants.\nThe\nNYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in\nour securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nWe\ncannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on the NYSE after the Business Combination. In connection with\nthe Business Combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE\u2019s initial listing requirements, which\nare more rigorous than the NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities\non the NYSE. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our aggregate market value\nwould be required to be at least $150 million, and the market value of our publicly held shares would be required to\nbe at least $40 million. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nOur continued eligibility for listing may depend on, among other things, the number of our shares that are redeemed.\nIf the NYSE delists\nour securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange,\nwe expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant\nmaterial adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a\nlimited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced\nliquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a\ndetermination that our Class A common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which\nwill require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent\nrules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading\nmarket for our securities;\n\u25cf a\nlimited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a\ndecreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the\nfuture.\nThe\nNational Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or pre-empts the states from regulating\nthe sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our units, Class A common\nstock and public warrants are listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A common stock and public warrants qualify as covered\nsecurities. Although the states are pre-empted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow\nthe states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then\nthe states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used\nthese powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain\nstate securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers,\nto hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our\nsecurities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nOur\nboard of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in determining whether or not to proceed with the\nBusiness Combination.\nOur\nboard of directors did not obtain a third-party valuation or fairness opinion in connection with its determination to approve\nthe Business Combination. Our officers and directors have substantial experience in evaluating the operating and financial merits\nof companies from a wide range of industries and concluded that their experience and backgrounds, together with the experience\nand sector expertise of our advisors, enabled them to make the necessary analyses and determinations regarding the Business Combination.\nAccordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in valuing ChargePoint and assuming the\nrisk that our board of directors may not have properly valued the business. The lack of a third-party valuation or fairness\nopinion may also lead an increased number of stockholders to vote against the proposed Business Combination or demand redemption\nof their shares for cash, which could potentially impact our ability to consummate the Business Combination.\nA\nsignificant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the\nnear future. This could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is\ndoing well.\nSales\nof a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the\nperception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of\nour Class A common stock. After the Business Combination (and assuming no redemptions by our public stockholders of public\nshares), our Sponsor and our current officers and directors will hold approximately 2.5% of our Class A common stock, including\nthe 6,868,235 shares of Class A common stock into which the Founder Shares will convert (or 2.8% of our Class A\ncommon stock, assuming a maximum redemption by our public stockholders of 100% of the public shares). Pursuant to the terms of\na letter agreement entered into at the time of the IPO, and reaffirmed in the Founders Stock Letter, the Founder Shares (which\nwill be converted into shares of Class A common stock at the Closing) may not be transferred until the earlier to occur of\n(a) one year after the Closing or (b) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar\ntransaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities\nor other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds\n$12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading\ndays within any 30 trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing, the shares of Class A common stock\ninto which the Founder Shares convert will be released from these transfer restrictions. Pursuant to the A&R Registration\nRights Agreement, New ChargePoint will agree that, within 15 business days after the Closing, New ChargePoint will file with the\nSEC (at New ChargePoint\u2019s sole cost and expense) the Resale Registration Statement, and New ChargePoint will use its commercially\nreasonable efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing\nthereof. In certain circumstances, the Registration Rights Holders can demand up to four underwritten offerings and will be entitled\nto customary piggyback registration rights.\nFurther,\npursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Company agreed that, within 15 business days after the consummation of the Business\nCombination, New ChargePoint will file with the SEC (at New ChargePoint\u2019s sole cost and expense) a registration statement\nregistering the resale of the shares of Class A common stock that are issued in the PIPE Financing (the \u201cPIPE Resale Registration\nStatement\u201d), and New ChargePoint will use its reasonable best efforts to have the PIPE Resale Registration Statement declared\neffective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. This registration statement will also cover shares issuable upon exercise\nof the public warrants. The sale of shares under the PIPE Resale Registration Statement is likely to have an adverse effect on\nthe trading price of the Class A common stock.\nIf\nthe Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market\nprice of our securities may decline.\nIf\nthe benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of\nour securities prior to the Closing may decline. The market values of our securities at the time of the Business Combination may\nvary significantly from their prices on the date the Business Combination Agreement was executed or the date on which our stockholders\nvote on the Business Combination.\nIn\naddition, following the Business Combination, fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all\nor part of your investment. Prior to the Business Combination, trading in the shares of our Class A common stock has not\nbeen active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to our Class A common stock in the Business Combination may not be indicative\nof the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. If an active market for our securities\ndevelops and continues, the trading price of our securities following the Business Combination could be volatile and subject to\nwide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could\nhave a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below\nthe price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further\ndecline.\nFactors\naffecting the trading price of our securities following the Business Combination may include:\n\u25cf actual\nor anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial\nresults of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes\nin the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf success\nof competitors;\n\u25cf our\noperating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors\nin a particular period;\n\u25cf changes\nin financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning New ChargePoint\nor the market in general;\n\u25cf operating\nand stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf our\nability to market new and enhanced products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u25cf changes\nin laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf our\nability to meet compliance requirements;\n\u25cf commencement\nof, or involvement in, litigation involving New ChargePoint;\n\u25cf changes\nin our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of\nadditional debt;\n\u25cf the\nvolume of shares of our Class A common stock available for public sale;\n\u25cf any\nmajor change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf sales\nof substantial amounts of Class A common stock by our directors, executive officers\nor significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf general\neconomic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international\ncurrency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad\nmarket and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance.\nThe stock market in general and the NYSE have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate\nto the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our\nsecurities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies\nwhich investors perceive to be similar to New ChargePoint following the Business Combination could depress our stock price regardless\nof our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also\ncould adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nFollowing\nthe Business Combination, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us,\nour business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the price\nand trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe\ntrading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts\nmay publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover New ChargePoint following\nthe Business Combination change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations\nabout our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover New ChargePoint\nfollowing the Business Combination were to cease their coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility\nin the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur\nSponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may elect to purchase public shares from public stockholders,\nwhich may influence the vote on the Business Combination proposal and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nOur\nSponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated\ntransactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of the Business Combination, although they are\nunder no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of public shares our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any\nof their respective affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules of the\nNYSE. Any such privately negotiated purchases may be effected at purchase prices that are in excess of the per share pro rata\nportion of the Trust Account. However, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and their respective affiliates have no current\ncommitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.\nNone of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions. None of our Sponsor, directors,\nofficers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material\nnon-public information not disclosed to the seller of such public shares or during a restricted period under Regulation M\nunder the Exchange Act. Such a purchase could include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the\nrecord holder of such public shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption\nrights, and could include a contractual provision that directs such stockholder to vote such shares in a manner directed by the\npurchaser.\nIn\nthe event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated\ntransactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders\nwould be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares.\nThe\npurpose of any such purchases of public shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase\nthe likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in the Business\nCombination Agreement, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our public shares\nmay result in the completion of the Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be\nreported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent the purchasers are subject to such\nreporting requirements.\nIn\naddition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A common stock may be reduced and the number\nof beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing\nor trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nChanges\nin laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and\nresults of operations.\nWe\nare subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply\nwith certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult,\ntime consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time\nand those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a\nfailure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, including our ability to negotiate and complete the Business Combination, and results of operations.\nThe\nJOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe\nqualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by\nthe JOBS Act. As such, we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public\ncompanies that are not emerging growth companies, including (a) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with\nrespect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (b) the exemptions\nfrom say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (c) reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, our stockholders may not have access\nto certain information they deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last\nday of the fiscal year (i) following July 30, 2024, the fifth anniversary of our Public Offering, (ii) in which\nwe have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to\ntime) or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common\nstock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter,\nand (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three\nyear period.\nIn\naddition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying\nwith new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging\ngrowth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards\nwould otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition\nperiod and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is\nirrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or\nrevised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the\nnew or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial\nstatements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted\nout of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards\nused.\nWe\ncannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for\nour Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur\nwarrants and Founder Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult\nto effectuate our Business Combination.\nWe\nissued warrants to purchase 10,470,587 shares of Class A common stock as part of the units. We also issued 5,521,568\nprivate placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share.\nOur\ninitial stockholders currently own an aggregate of 7,852,941 Founder Shares. Immediately prior to the Closing, the initial stockholders\nwill forfeit an aggregate of 984,706 Founder Shares in accordance with the terms of the Founders Stock Letter. The Founder Shares\nare convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits,\nstock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and subject to further adjustment as set forth herein. In addition,\nif our Sponsor makes any Working Capital Loans (as defined below), it may convert those loans into up to an additional 1,000,000\nprivate placement warrants, at the price of $1.50 per warrant. Any issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A\ncommon stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of\nClass A common stock and reduce the value of the Class A common stock issued to complete the Business Combination. Therefore,\nour warrants and Founder Shares may make it more difficult to effectuate the Business Combination or increase the cost of acquiring\nChargePoint.\nWe\ndo not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to\ncomplete the Business Combination even if a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.\nOur\nCharter does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem public shares in an\namount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny\nstock\u201d rules). As a result, we may be able to complete the Business Combination even though a substantial majority of our\npublic stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or have entered into privately negotiated\nagreements to sell their shares to our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates. In the event\nthe aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted\nfor redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Business Combination\nexceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Business Combination or redeem any shares, all shares\nof Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an\nalternate Business Combination.\nOur\nstockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interests after the Business Combination and will exercise less influence\nover management.\nUpon\nthe issuance of the shares of Class A common stock to the ChargePoint stockholders and the investors in the PIPE Financing, current\nholders of our common stock will be diluted. Following the consummation of the Business Combination and the PIPE Financing, current\nholders of our common stock would own 13.7% of New ChargePoint.\nThe\nmarket price of shares of Class A common stock after the Business Combination may be affected by factors different from those\ncurrently affecting the price of shares of Class A common stock.\nUpon\ncompletion of the Business Combination, ChargePoint stockholders will become holders of Class A common stock. Prior to the Business\nCombination, Switchback has limited operations. Upon completion of the Business Combination, Switchback\u2019s results of operations\nwill depend upon the performance of the ChargePoint business, which is affected by factors that are different from those currently\naffecting the results of operations of Switchback.\nThe\nBusiness Combination or post-combination company may be materially adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn\nDecember 2019, COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has and is continuing to spread\nthroughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization\n(\u201cWHO\u201d) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d On\nJanuary 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States\nto aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized the outbreak\nas a \u201cpandemic.\u201d The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted, and a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases\ncould result, in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide. Additionally,\nour ability to consummate the Business Combination may be materially adversely affected due to significant governmental measures\nbeing implemented to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 or its impact, including travel restrictions, the shutdown of businesses\nand quarantines, among others, which may limit our ability to have meetings with potential investors or affect the ability of\nChargePoint\u2019s personnel, vendors and service providers to negotiate and consummate the Business Combination in a timely\nmanner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Business Combination will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the\nactions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters\nof global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate the Business Combination may be materially\nadversely affected.", "PERMNO": 18937, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SBE"}
