{"cik": "910638", "company": "3D SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf any of the risks described below or if any other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe face significant competition in many aspects of our business, which could cause our revenue and gross profit margins to decline. Competition could also cause us to reduce sales prices or to incur additional marketing or production costs, which could result in decreased revenue, increased costs and reduced margins.\nWe compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment and software for models, prototypes, other three-dimensional objects and end-use parts as well as producers of materials and services for this equipment. Some of our existing and potential competitors are researching, designing, developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment and software, materials and services. Certain of these competitors may have financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours.\nWe also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents, from the issuance of patents to other companies that may inhibit our ability to develop certain products and from improvements to existing materials and equipment technologies.\nSome of our patents have recently expired and others will expire in coming years. Upon expiration of those patents, our competitors may introduce products using the technology previously protected by the expired patents and those products may have lower prices than those of our products. To compete, we may need to reduce our prices for those products, which could adversely affect our revenues, margins and profitability. Additionally, the expiration of our patents could reduce barriers to entry into additive manufacturing, which could result in the reduction of our sales and earnings potential. If competitors using technology previously protected by our expired patents were to introduce products of inferior quality, our potential customers may view the technology negatively, which would have an adverse effect on our image and reputation and on our ability to compete with systems using other additive fabrication technologies.\nWe intend to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition. If we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products, we may lose revenue and demand for our products. We also incur significant costs associated with the investment in our product development activities in furtherance of our strategy that may not result in increased revenue or demand for our products and that could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to deliver products and services that meet changing technology and customer needs.\nOur business may be affected by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices, any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology obsolete. Accordingly, our ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable us to maintain technological leadership. We believe that to remain competitive we must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. However, there is a risk that we may not be able to:\n\u2022Develop or obtain leading technologies useful in our business;\n\u2022Enhance our existing products;\n\u2022Develop new products, services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers, particularly in the area of printer speeds and materials functionality;\n\u2022Respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis; or\n\u2022Recruit or retain key technology employees.\nIf we are unable to meet changing technology and customer needs, our competitive position, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not generate net cash flow from operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund future working capital needs and meet capital expenditure requirements.\nIf we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring or incurring additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to obtain additional capital or refinance any indebtedness will depend on, among other things, the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms and conditions of any such financing or indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nThe lack of additional capital resulting from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any necessary funds, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we would not be able to execute our growth strategy and we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy.\nOur business could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.\nWe have experienced cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. Prior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our business or financial results; however, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber security assessment analyses undertaken by us have identified and prioritized steps to fortify our cyber security safeguards. We have and will continue to implement additional security measures and processes which enhance our ability to detect and respond to a cyber-attack. We have increased our cyber breach insurance and implemented company-wide cyber security awareness training. Despite the implementation of these new safeguards, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of the products and services we provide. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nWe may need to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our financial results or our reputation; or such events could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property or early obsolescence of our products and services.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investments.\nIn particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and United Kingdom Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d) and the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) of the Department of Commerce. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign customers, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.\nAs part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in Brazil, China, India and developing countries, and our development of new partnerships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) administered by the DDTC, the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) administered by the BIS and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by OFAC. The EAR governs products, parts, technology and software which present military or weapons proliferation concerns, so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items, and ITAR governs military items listed on the United States Munitions List. Prior to shipping certain items, we must obtain an export license or verify that license exemptions are available. Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties.\nViolations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment and could harm our reputation, create negative shareholder sentiment and affect our share value. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, the DDTC and BIS, and have trained our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, persons and entities, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or our subsidiaries, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We cannot predict the outcome of these or any other legal matters. In the future, we may need to record litigation contingencies with respect to these matters because our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe disclosed potential violations of U.S. export controls laws to the U.S. federal government that resulted in multiple investigations. We have implemented compliance processes and procedures to identify and prevent potential future violations of export control laws, trade sanctions, and government contracting laws and regulations, and continue to review our government contracting compliance risks and potential violations. Based on the disclosures and investigations, the U.S. Air Force temporarily suspended us from certain new federal contracts and orders in July 2019 and lifted that suspension in September 2019 following the execution of an Administrative Agreement with the Company. Failure to comply with the terms of the Administrative Agreement or the commencement of a separate action by another governmental agency would result in decreased revenues and additional harm to our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn October 2017, we received an administrative subpoena from BIS requesting the production of records in connection with possible violations of U.S. export control laws, including with regard to our Quickparts.com, Inc. subsidiary. In addition, while collecting information responsive to the above-referenced subpoena, our internal investigation identified potential violations of ITAR administered by DDTC and potential violations of the Export Administration Regulations administered by BIS.\nOn June 8, 2018 and thereafter, we submitted voluntary disclosures to BIS and DDTC identifying numerous potentially unauthorized exports of technical data. As part of our ongoing review of trade compliance risks and our cooperation with the government, on November 20, 2019, we submitted to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) an initial notice of voluntary disclosure regarding potential violations of economic sanctions related to Iran. We are continuing to investigate this issue and will file a final disclosure with OFAC when our review is complete. We have and will continue to implement compliance enhancements to our export controls, trade sanctions, and government contracting compliance program to address the issues identified through our ongoing internal investigation and will cooperate with DDTC and BIS, as well as the U.S. Departments of Justice, Defense, Homeland Security and Treasury in their ongoing reviews of these matters.\nIn addition, on July 19, 2019, we received a notice of immediate suspension of federal contracting from the United States Air Force, pending the outcome of an ongoing investigation. The suspension applied to 3D Systems, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and was related to export controls violations involving 3D Systems\u2019 On Demand manufacturing business described above. Under the suspension, we were generally prohibited from receiving new federal government contracts or subcontracts from any executive branch agency as described in the provisions of 48 C.F.R Subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The suspension allowed us to continue to perform current federal contracts, and also to receive awards of new subcontracts for items under $35,000 and for items considered commercially available off-the-shelf items. The Air Force lifted the suspension on September 6, 2019 following the execution of a two-year Administrative Agreement with the Company. The Company is now eligible to obtain and perform U.S. government contracts and subcontracts without the suspension restrictions. Under the Administrative Agreement, the Company will be monitored and evaluated by independent monitors who will report to the Air Force on the Company\u2019s compliance with the terms of the Company\u2019s Ethics & Compliance Program, including our overall culture, government contracting compliance program, and export controls compliance program. The Company\u2019s failure to comply fully with the terms of the Administrative Agreement or the commencement of separate actions by other agencies of the federal government could result in reinstatement of the suspension or debarment from future federal contracting, which would result in decreased revenues and additional harm to our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition,\nAlthough we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal costs and other expenses in connection with responding to the U.S. government agencies.\nSince 2018, we have implemented new compliance procedures to identify and prevent potential violations of export controls laws, trade sanctions, and government contracting laws and regulations and created a Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors to further enhance board oversight of compliance risks. As we continue to implement additional compliance enhancements, we may discover additional potential violations of export controls laws, trade sanctions, and/or government contracting laws in the future. If we identify any additional potential violations, we will submit voluntary disclosures to the relevant agencies and cooperate with such agencies on any related investigations. Independent monitors will observe and evaluate the Company\u2019s continued compliance with its Ethics & Compliance Program during the term of the Administrative Agreement.\nIf the U.S. government finds that we have violated one or more export controls laws, trade sanctions, or government contracting laws, we could be subject to various civil or criminal penalties. By statute, these penalties can include but are not limited to fines, which by statute may be significant, denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. We may also be subject to contract claims based upon such violations. Any assessment of penalties or other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters could harm our reputation and customer relationships, create negative investor sentiment, and affect our share value. In connection with any resolution, we may also be required to undertake\nadditional remedial compliance measures and program monitoring. We cannot at this time predict when the U.S. government agencies will conclude their investigations or determine an estimated cost, if any, or range of costs, for any penalties, fines or other liabilities to third parties that may be incurred in connection with these matters.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.\nIn connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party intellectual property claims asserted against us could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from assembling or licensing certain of our products, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the marketplaces in which we compete or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products. Any of these could seriously harm our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information, including our digital content, from third-party infringers or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nAlthough we defend our intellectual property rights and endeavor to combat unlicensed copying and use of our digital content and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights (\u201cpiracy attacks\u201d) is inherently difficult. If our intellectual property becomes subject to piracy attacks, our business may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we endeavor to protect the secrecy of our digital content, confidential information and trade secrets. If unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets occurs, we could potentially lose trade secret protection. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying previously confidential features, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements. However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights.\nOur uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\nOur quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter\u2019s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter, in particular for sales of hardware. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as an information systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.\nThe variety of products that we sell could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our gross profit margins, and those fluctuations in margins could cause fluctuations in operating income or loss and net income or loss.\nWe continuously work to expand and improve our products, materials and services offerings, geographic areas in which we operate and the distribution channels we use to reach various target product applications and customers. This variety of products, applications, channels and regions involves a range of gross profit margins that can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter. Additionally, the introduction of new products or services may further heighten quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins due to manufacturing ramp-up and start-up costs. We may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins or operating income or loss due to the impact of the mix of products, channels or geographic areas in which we sell our products from period to period.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from business conducted outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.\nWe face many risks inherent in conducting business activities outside the U.S. that, unless managed properly, may adversely affect our profitability, including our ability to collect amounts due from customers. While most of our operations outside the U.S. are conducted in highly developed countries, our operations could be adversely affected by, among others, the following:\n\u2022Unexpected changes in laws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u2022Changes in regulatory requirements, including export controls, tariffs and embargoes, other trade restrictions, competition, corporate practices and data privacy concerns;\n\u2022Political policies, political or civil unrest, terrorism or epidemics and other similar outbreaks;\n\u2022Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022Limited protection for the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022Operating in countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices;\n\u2022Effects of the implementation of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, known as Brexit;\n\u2022Potentially adverse changes in taxation;\n\u2022The impact of public health epidemics on employees and the global economy, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China and elsewhere; and\n\u2022Other factors, depending upon the specific country in which we conduct business.\nThese uncertainties may make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately plan future business activities and may lead our customers in certain countries to delay purchases of our products and services. More generally, these geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in global financial markets and economies.\nThe consequences of terrorism or armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business. We are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism, acts of war and similar events.\nWhile the geographic areas outside the U.S. in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary, our foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from, among other things, certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated, for example, in U.S. dollars rather than their respective functional currencies.\nMoreover, our operations are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when we consider it to be appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. However, our efforts to minimize our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful.\nWe depend on outsourcing partners for assembly of our 3D printers and our supply chain for spare parts and for raw materials used in our materials. If these relationships were to terminate or be disrupted, our business could be disrupted while we locate alternative suppliers and our expenses may increase.\nWe have outsourced selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble our printers. In carrying out these outsourcing activities, we face a number of risks, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022The risk that the parties that we retain to perform assembly activities may not perform in a satisfactory manner;\n\u2022The risk of disruption in the supply of printers or other products to our customers if such third parties either fail to perform in a satisfactory manner or are unable to supply us with the quantity of printers or other products that are needed to meet then current customer demand; and\n\u2022The risk of insolvency of suppliers, as well as the risks that we face, as discussed below, in dealing with a limited number of suppliers.\nWe purchase components and sub-assemblies for our printers from third-party suppliers that we provide to our customers as spare parts. Additionally, we purchase raw materials that are used in our materials, as well as certain of those materials, from third-party suppliers.\nWhile there are several potential suppliers of parts for our products, we currently choose to use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these items, including our lasers, materials and certain jetting components. Our reliance on a single or limited number of suppliers involves many risks, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022Potential shortages of some key components;\n\u2022Disruptions in the operations of these suppliers;\n\u2022Product performance shortfalls; and\n\u2022Reduced control over delivery schedules, assembly capabilities, quality and costs.\nWhile we believe that we can obtain all the components necessary for our spare parts and materials from other manufacturers, we require any new supplier to become \u201cqualified\u201d pursuant to our internal procedures, which could involve evaluation processes of varying durations. Our spare parts and raw materials used in our materials production are subject to various lead times. In addition, at any time, certain suppliers may decide to discontinue production of a part or raw material that we use. Any unanticipated change in the sources of our supplies, or unanticipated supply limitations, could increase production or related costs and consequently reduce margins.\nIf our forecasts exceed actual orders, we may hold large inventories of slow-moving or unusable parts, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. Inversely, we may lose orders if our forecast is low and we are unable to meet demand.\nOur operations could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key management or other key employees.\nOur success depends upon the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our senior executive team is critical to the management of our business and operations, as well as to the development and execution of our strategy. In 2019, our former Chief Financial Officer retired and we incurred costs to identify, recruit, and hire our current CFO, including amounts payable to our former CFO under his Transition Agreement, CFO search costs and relocation costs. On February 5, 2020, Vyomesh Joshi, our President and Chief Executive Officer, announced his intention to retire in 2020. We anticipate incurring similar or higher costs to identify and ensure the services of a highly-qualified successor to Mr. Joshi. High demand exists for senior management and other key personnel (including scientific, technical and sales personnel) in the 3D printing industry, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel.\nWhile we intend to continue to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel and engage in regular succession planning for these positions, some of our competitors for these employees have greater resources and more experience, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. If we cannot attract and retain sufficiently qualified technical employees for our research and development and manufacturing operations, we may be unable to develop and commercialize new products or new applications for existing products. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the regions surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.\nWe rely on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other key functions. If our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely on our management information systems to, among other things, effectively manage our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; to manage our manufacturing and supply chain processes; and to maintain our research and development data. The failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt our business and product development, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business and operating results to suffer. Although we take steps to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet and Internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss or other disruptive events. Our reputation and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shut down; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin, product returns, product liability, warranty or other claims that could result in significant expenses and harm to our reputation.\nWe sell complex hardware and software products, materials and services that can contain undetected design and manufacturing defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that, despite testing, are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers. Sophisticated software and applications, such as those sold by us, may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products we purchase from third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software, materials and services we sell. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, product returns, product liability, delayed market acceptance of those products and services, claims from distributors, end-users or others, increased end-user service and support costs, and significant warranty claims and other expenses to correct the defects, diversion of management time and attention and harm to our reputation.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nAs privacy, data protection and information security laws, including data localization laws, are interpreted and applied, compliance costs may increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security in the U.S. and in various countries in which we operate.\nIn addition, state and federal legislators and/or regulators in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws relating to consumer and/or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our products and services and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions and financial markets may harm our ability to do business, adversely affect our sales, costs, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to global economic, political and social conditions that may cause customers to delay or reduce technology purchases due to economic downturns, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, geopolitical uncertainties, tariffs and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. We face risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, resellers or customers, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022Customers or partners to whom we sell our products and services may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to our inability to obtain payment of accounts receivable that those customers may owe;\n\u2022Customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products;\n\u2022Key suppliers of raw materials, finished products or components used in the products that we sell may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to disruption in the supply of printers, materials or spare parts to our customers; and\n\u2022The inability of customers, including resellers, suppliers and contract manufacturers, to obtain credit financing to finance purchases of our products and raw materials used to build those products.\nChanges in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and future profitability.\nWe are a U.S. based, multinational company subject to taxation in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we do business, changes in the amount of revenue or earnings in the countries with varying statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) is one such example of legislation that impacts our effective tax rate and tax posture. For additional details see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we are subject to audits and examinations of previously filed income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential impact of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that we expect may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there is no assurance that the final determination of any examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nWe have made, and may make in the future, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that may involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert management attention. Likewise, our potential future divestitures may be unsuccessful and negatively impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that fit our business objectives. Acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022Difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which may also impact our ability to realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022The risk that significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration may be encountered;\n\u2022The challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;\n\u2022The risk that our marketplaces do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in the marketplaces that we serve;\n\u2022The risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying party;\n\u2022The inability to maintain a relationship with key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022The difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u2022The potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022The risk of diverting management attention from our existing operations;\n\u2022Difficulties in coordinating geographically disparate organizations and corporate cultures and integrating management personnel with different business backgrounds;\n\u2022The potential failure of the due diligence process to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;\n\u2022The risk that we incur significant costs associated with such acquisition activity that may negatively impact our operating results before the benefits of such acquisitions are realized, if at all;\n\u2022The entry into marketplaces where we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions;\n\u2022The exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with our assuming claims or litigation risks from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or other third parties; and\n\u2022The risk that historical financial information may not be representative or indicative of our results as a combined company.\nHistorically, we have grown organically and from acquisitions, and we intend to continue to grow. Our infrastructure will require, among other things, continued development of our financial and management controls and management information systems, management of our sales channel, continued capital expenditures, the ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training of new personnel. We cannot be sure that our infrastructure, systems, procedures, business processes and managerial controls will be adequate to support the growth in our operations. Any delays in, or problems associated with, implementing, or transitioning to, new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls to accommodate and support the requirements of our business and operations and to effectively and efficiently integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our ability to meet customer requirements, manage our product inventory, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These potential negative effects could prevent us from realizing the benefits of an acquisition transaction or other growth opportunity.\nLikewise, we have in the past, and may in the future, divest certain business operations. Divestitures involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.\nIn the event an unsuccessful acquisition or divestiture, our competitive position, revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired.\nGoodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to dispose of a business or product line. We face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in customer demand. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, which could result in material expense, diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation.\nThe sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims. From time to time, we may become subject to product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses. The risk may be heightened when we provide products into certain markets, such as healthcare, aerospace and automotive industries.\nThis risk of product liability claims may also be greater due to the use of certain hazardous chemicals used in the production of certain of our products, including irritants, harmful chemicals and chemicals dangerous to the environment. We may also be subject to claims that our products have been, or may be used to, create parts that are not in compliance with legal requirements or that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products and other issues. However, the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer. Their effect is subject to a variety of legal limitations and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future.\nAny claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in significant expense, diversion of management time and attention, damage to our business reputation and failure to retain existing customers or to attract new customers. Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. Costs or payments made in connection with product liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur business involves the blending, controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our suppliers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe the safety procedures we utilized for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, local, state, federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. If we are subject to any liability as a result of activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected and our reputation may be harmed.\nOur common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, considerable volatility. Between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $6.47 per share to a high of $21.78 per share. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K, as well as, among other things:\n\u2022Our perceived value in the securities markets;\n\u2022Overall trends in the stock market;\n\u2022Announcements of changes in our forecasted operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;\n\u2022Compliance with the terms of our Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Air Force;\n\u2022The impact of changes in our results of operations, our financial condition or our prospects;\n\u2022Future sales of our common stock or other securities (including any shares issued in connection with earn-out obligations for any past or future acquisition);\n\u2022Market conditions for providers of products and services such as ours;\n\u2022Executive level management uncertainty or change;\n\u2022Changes in recommendations or revenue or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u2022Announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.", "PERMNO": 78664, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "DDD"}
