{"cik": "795212", "company": "TRANS WORLD ENTERTAINMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the continued declines in the physical video and music industries.\nPhysical media sales have suffered from the shift of content to digital distribution, streaming and online retailers that offer entertainment products at discounted prices and collectively have gained a larger share of the market. Physical video and music represent approximately 45% of sales and have been impacted by new distribution channels, including digital distribution, streaming and internet fulfillment.\nIf we cannot successfully implement our business strategy our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future results will depend, among other things, on our success in implementing our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business strategy or that the strategy will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability.\nDuring fiscal 2018, in response to the general decline in operating results, management implemented the following strategic initiatives, operational efficiencies and other considerations directed towards improving the etailz segment\u2019s performance, operations, and cash flow:\nVendor Rationalization and Remediation\nUsing a profit driven approach, the Company determined there was an opportunity to rationalize and remediate its vendor portfolio to improve profitability, streamline core operations and improve efficiencies. Rationalization and remediation activities included terminating unprofitable vendors and improving vendor relationships through negotiations focused on improvements to gross margins and supply chain efficiencies.\nSG&A Rationalization\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, etailz implemented certain strategic initiatives in order to create operation efficiencies directed towards improving the etailz segment\u2019s performance, operations, and cash flow to support the ongoing operating model changes and to create a leaner organization that is better aligned with current and future business focus. As part of the initiatives, a 30% reduction in force was implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Additional reductions implemented included expenses related to technology, hardware, and employee benefits.\nWorking Capital Optimization\nThe segment is in the process of implementing strategies that will enhance sales, improve inventory turns and decrease Amazon storage fees.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may suffer if the Company does not accurately predict consumer acceptance of new products or distribution technologies or adapt to a shift to multichannel experience.\nThe entertainment industry is characterized by changing technology, evolving format standards, and new and enhanced product introductions. These characteristics require the Company to respond quickly to technological\nchanges and understand the impact of these changes on customers\u2019 preferences. If the Company is unable to participate in new product or distribution technologies, its results of operations may suffer. Specifically, CD and DVD formats have experienced a continuous decline as digital forms of music and video content have become more prevalent. If the Company does not timely adapt to these changing technologies and sufficiently shift to other merchandise categories, operating results could significantly suffer.\nIn addition, multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving with the increasing use of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in stores and online and the increased use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences. If we are unable to adapt to the growth of multichannel retailing, and keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors, customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nIncreased competition from existing retailers, including internet retailers, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company competes with a wide variety of entertainment retailers, including mass merchandisers, consumer electronics outlets, internet retailers and independent operators, some of whom have greater financial and other resources than the Company and frequently sell their product at discounted prices or with added value.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers. The retail business is highly competitive. In the past, the Company has been able to compete by differentiating our customer shopping experience, by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, customer service and marketing efforts. Customer perceptions regarding our stores, our in-stock position and deep assortment of product are also factors in our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross profit and expenses. If we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which many of our stores are located; any decrease in consumer traffic in those malls could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn order to generate customer traffic, we depend heavily on locating many of our stores in prominent locations within shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived from the volume of traffic in those malls. Our stores benefit from the ability of a mall\u2019s other tenants to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Our sales volume and mall traffic generally may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns in a particular area, competition from e-commerce retailers, non-mall retailers and other malls, increases in gasoline prices, fluctuations in exchange rates in border or tourism-oriented locations and the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the malls in which we are located. An uncertain economic outlook could curtail new shopping mall development, decrease shopping mall traffic, reduce the number of hours that shopping mall operators keep their shopping malls open or force them to cease operations entirely. A reduction in mall traffic as a result of these or any other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued increases in Amazon Marketplace fulfillment and storage fees could have an adverse impact on our profit margin and results of operations.\netailz utilizes Amazon\u2019s Freight by Amazon (\u201cFBA\u201d) platform to store their products at the Amazon fulfillment center and to pack and distribute these products to customers. If Amazon continues to increase its FBA fees, our profit margin for the etailz segment could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business is influenced by general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. General economic conditions impacting discretionary consumer spending include, among others, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy affects specialty retailers disproportionately, as consumers may prioritize reductions in discretionary spending, which could have a direct impact on purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, reduced consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nDisruption of global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\nDistress in the financial markets has in the past and can in the future result in extreme volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our credit facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent upon access to capital, including bank credit facilities and short-term vendor financing, for its liquidity needs.\nThe Company must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its working capital requirements and indebtedness. The Company believes that the combination of its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow received from operations, funds available under the Company\u2019s credit facility and short-term vendor financing will be sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s normal working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of liquidity do not satisfy the Company\u2019s requirements, the Company may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and the Company\u2019s credit rating, as well as the Company\u2019s reputation with potential lenders. These factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fund its working capital requirements, costs of borrowing, and the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nHistorically, we have experienced declines and we may continue to experience fluctuation in our level of sales and results from operations.\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our sales results and profit margins. These factors include general, regional and national economic conditions; competition; actions taken by our competitors; consumer trends and preferences; new product introductions and changes in our product mix; timing and effectiveness of promotional events and weather. fye\u2019s annual comparable store sales may decline further than they did in fiscal 2018. Also, they may vary from quarter to quarter as our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating income historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due in part to the holiday selling season. The fourth fiscal quarter generated approximately 30% of our\ntotal revenue for fiscal 2018. Any decrease in our fourth fiscal quarter sales, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, unseasonable weather conditions, economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year. There is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to open new stores or renew existing leases in profitable stores may limit our earnings.\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s growth has come from adding stores. The Company opens new stores if it finds desirable locations and is able to negotiate suitable lease terms for profitability. A lack of new store growth may impact the Company\u2019s ability to increase sales and earnings. During fiscal 2018, the Company did not open any new stores and closed 50 stores with expiring leases. The Company regularly renews leases at existing locations if those stores are profitable. Failure to renew these leases may impact the Company\u2019s earnings. See Item 2: Properties, for timing of lease expirations.\nA change in one or more of the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 policies or the Company\u2019s relationship with those vendors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, the Company could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales.\nApproximately 37% of fye segment\u2019s purchases come from ten major suppliers. As is standard in its industry, the Company does not maintain long-term contracts with its suppliers but instead makes purchases on an order-by-order basis. If the Company fails to maintain customary trade terms or enjoy positive vendor relations, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nHistorically, the etailz segment has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and management believes that it will continue to have access to adequate sources of supply. No individual supplier exceeded 10% of etailz purchases.\netailz revenue is dependent upon maintaining etailz\u2019s relationship with Amazon and failure to do so, or any restrictions on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\netailz generates substantially all of its revenue through the Amazon Marketplace. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with Amazon for the continued growth of the etailz segment. In particular, we depend on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace. We also depend on Amazon for the timely delivery of products to customers. Any adverse change in our relationship with Amazon, including restrictions on the ability to offer products or termination of the relationship, could adversely affect the continued growth of our etailz segment and our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the availability of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the release of \u201chit\u201d music and video titles, which can create fluctuations in sales. It is not possible to determine the timing of these fluctuations or the future availability of hit titles. The Company is dependent upon the major music and movie producers to continue to produce hit products. To the extent that new hit releases are not available, or not available at prices attractive to consumers, or, if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new products, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe manufacturers of entertainment products have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, the Company receives cooperative advertising and other allowances from these vendors. These allowances enable the Company to actively promote and merchandise the products it sells at its stores and on its websites. If the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide this support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreach of data security could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and transmission of the payment card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of customer payment card or personal information or employee personal or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, harm our business and have an adverse impact upon our net sales and profitability. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be\nsubject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, theft or intrusion that could harm our business.\nOur success, in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels and process customer transactions, largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory at the store level and aggregate daily sales information, communicate customer information and process purchasing card transactions, process shipments of goods and report financial information.\nAny failure of our computer hardware or software systems that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability. Additionally, if any data intrusion, security breach, misappropriation or theft were to occur, we could incur significant costs in responding to such event, including responding to any resulting claims, litigation or investigations, which could harm our operating results.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or any claimed infringement by us of third party intellectual rights, could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, including proprietary software, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could cause a decline in our revenue. In addition, any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us could be time-consuming to address, result in costly litigation, cause product delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or result in our loss of ownership or use of the intellectual property.\nLoss of key personnel or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its future prospects depend, to a significant extent, on the services of its executive officers. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain a large number of qualified team members. Many of those team members are employed in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce (none of which is represented by unions) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer\u2019s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining units are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, health care mandates, and changes in overtime regulations.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Global Market, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution center is disrupted.\nWe operate a distribution center in Albany, New York. We ship approximately 82% of our fye segment merchandise inventory through our distribution center. If our distribution center is destroyed or disrupted for any reason, including weather, fire, labor, or other issues we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes to reopen or replace the distribution center.\nWe maintain business interruption insurance to protect us from the costs relating to matters such as a shutdown, but our insurance may not be sufficient, or the insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us, in the event of a shutdown.\nWe may face difficulties in meeting our labor needs to effectively operate our business.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our labor workforce in the geographic areas where we conduct our business. Our compensation packages are designed to provide benefits commensurate with our level of expected service. However, within our retail and logistics operations, we face the challenge of filling many positions at wage scales that are appropriate to the industry and competitive factors. We also face other risks in meeting our labor needs, including competition for qualified personnel and overall unemployment levels. Changes in any of these factors, including a shortage of available workforce in areas in which we operate, could interfere with our ability to adequately service our customers or to open suitable locations and could result in increasing labor costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs, including costs related to an increase in minimum wage and health care.\nLabor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business. Increased labor costs, whether due to competition, unionization, increased minimum wage, state unemployment rates, health care, or other employee benefits costs may adversely impact our operating expenses. A considerable amount of our store team members are paid at rates related to the federal or state minimum wage and any changes to the minimum wage rate may increase our operating expenses. Furthermore, inconsistent increases in state and or city minimum wage requirements limit our ability to increase prices across all markets and channels. Additionally, we are self-insured with respect to our health care coverage in the U.S. and do not purchase third party insurance for the health insurance benefits provided to employees with the exception of pre-defined stop loss coverage, which helps limit the cost of large claims. There is no assurance that future health care legislation will not adversely impact our results or operations.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. We may incur losses relating to these claims, and in addition, these proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims that could adversely affect our results of operations. For a description of current legal proceedings, see \u201cPart I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nCertain of our strategies, including product innovations and expanding our exclusive offerings, may present greater risks.\nWe are continuously assessing opportunities to improve store productivity and complementary products and services related to our core business, including product innovations and exclusive offerings. We may expend both capital and personnel resources on such business opportunities which may or may not be successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop product innovations and exclusive offerings to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow.\nAn impairment of the carrying value of fixed assets, intangible assets and goodwill has negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our financial results.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have represented a substantial portion of our total assets.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually for impairment.\nDuring fiscal 2018, as a result of triggering events, the Company performed impairment tests on its fixed assets and intangible assets, and concluded that both its fixed assets and intangible assets were partially impaired. Additionally, as a result of the annual impairment review, the Company determined that goodwill was fully impaired during 2018. The Company recorded impairment losses of approximately $4.1 million and $16.4 million for the fixed assets and intangible assets, respectively. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $39.2 million for goodwill.\nIn the future, significant negative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of our long-lived assets may result in additional impairments to our fixed assets and intangible assets. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of fixed assets or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThe effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, and public health issues may adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes may affect store and distribution center operations. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect our ability to purchase merchandise from suppliers for sale to our customers. Public health issues, such as flu or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations and result in a significant part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt, or have an adverse effect on, our suppliers\u2019 operations, our operations, our customers, or customer demand. Our ability to mitigate the adverse effect of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of our disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, we cannot be certain that our plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of our products.\nThe terms of our asset-based revolving credit agreement impose certain restrictions on us that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our business could suffer if our ability to acquire financing is reduced or eliminated.\nWe maintain an asset-based revolving credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d) of up to $75 million. The ABL Facility contains various representations, warranties and restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to specified circumstances and exceptions, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, pay dividends or distributions with respect to capital stock, make prepayments on other indebtedness, engage in mergers, dispose of certain assets or change the nature of their business. In addition, excess availability equal to at least 10% of the loan cap must be maintained under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility does not otherwise contain financial maintenance covenants. These restrictions could (1) limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and (2) adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe ABL Facility includes customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-default to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments and change of control. Additionally, we cannot be assured that our borrowing relationship with our lenders will continue or that our lenders will remain able to support their commitments to us in the future. If our lenders fail to do so, then we may not be able to secure alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) owns approximately 39% of the outstanding Common Stock. Therefore, the trustees have significant influence and control over the outcome of any vote of the Company\u2019s Shareholders.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust owns approximately 39% of the outstanding Common Stock and there are no limitations on the Trust acquiring shares in the future. Accordingly, the trustees have significant influence over the election of our directors, the appointment of new management and the approval of actions requiring shareholder approval, such as adopting amendments to our articles of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. Such concentration of ownership and substantial voting influence may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, even if a change of control is in the best interest of all shareholders. There may be instances in which the interest of the Trust may conflict or be perceived as being in conflict with the interest of a holder of our securities or the interest of the Company. W. Michael Reickert, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is a trustee of the Trust.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced and could continue to experience volatility and could decline, resulting in a substantial loss on your investment.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for music and the home video industry. Changes in our comparable store net sales could also affect the price of our Common Stock. Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to comparable store sales, net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a further decline in the market price of our stock.\nIf we do not meet the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (\u201cthe NASDAQ\u201d), which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. On January 15, 2019, we received a letter from the NASDAQ stating that we are not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price of our common stock was below the required minimum of $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until July 15, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time before July 15, 2019 the closing bid price of our common stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide us with written confirmation that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and this matter will be closed. If we are unable to demonstrate compliance with Rule 5450(a)(1) by July 15, 2019, we can submit a request for an additional 180-day period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or that we will otherwise be in compliance with other NASDAQ listing criteria. If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or to meet the other applicable continued listing requirements in the future and NASDAQ determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock, reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for our Common Stock may have an adverse impact and cause significant fluctuation of market price.\nHistorically, ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of Common Stock has been concentrated in a small number of stockholders. Consequently, our Common Stock has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell our stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market by those larger stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and our stock could be difficult for a stockholder to liquidate.", "PERMNO": 10514, "SIC": 5735, "TIC": "KSPN"}
