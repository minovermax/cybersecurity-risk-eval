{"cik": "71691", "company": "NEW YORK TIMES CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or the price of our publicly traded securities could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks, or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, that may adversely affect us in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face a market undergoing profound transformation and significant competition in all aspects of our business.\nOur industry is transforming as consumer demand transitions from traditional media - such as print newspapers - to digital, resulting in rapid changes in consumer behavior, advertiser behavior, talent behavior and competitive boundaries. The future structure of our industry remains unpredictable, leading to significant opportunity and uncertainty for our business and our competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete for audience share and subscribers, as well as subscription revenue, advertising revenue, and other revenues such as licensing and affiliate referral revenues. Our competitors include content providers and distributors, as well as news aggregators, search engines and social media platforms. Competition among these companies is robust, and new competitors can quickly emerge.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond our control, including among others:\n\u2022our ability to continue delivering a breadth of high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience;\n\u2022our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors;\n\u2022the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, reliability and value of our digital products, compared with those of our competitors;\n\u2022the sustained engagement of our audience directly with our products;\n\u2022our ability to reach new users in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022our ability to develop, maintain and monetize our products;\n\u2022the pricing of our products and our content access model;\n\u2022our marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;\n\u2022our visibility on search engines and social media platforms and in mobile app stores, compared with that of our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, including journalists and people working in digital product development disciplines, among others, who are in high demand;\n\u2022our ability to provide advertisers with a compelling return on their investments; and\n\u2022our ability to manage and grow our business in a cost-effective manner.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have greater resources than we do, which may allow them to compete more effectively than us. In addition, several of the companies that have competing digital news destinations, subscriptions and other products, such as Apple and Alphabet, also control some of the primary environments in which we develop relationships with new users and market and sell subscriptions to our products, and therefore can affect our ability to compete effectively. Some of these companies encourage their large audiences to consume our content within their products, impacting our ability to attract, engage and monetize users directly.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 9\nOur ability to grow the size and profitability of our subscriber base depends on many factors, both within and beyond our control, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nRevenue from subscriptions to our digital and print products makes up a majority of our total revenue. Our future growth and profitability depend upon our ability to retain, grow and effectively monetize our audience and digital subscriber base in the United States and abroad. We have invested and will continue to invest significant resources in our efforts to do so, but there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully grow our subscriber base in line with our expectations, or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as adjusting our pricing or incurring subscription acquisition costs that could adversely affect our subscription revenues, margin and/or profitability.\nOur ability to attract and grow our digital subscriber base depends on the size of our audience and its sustained engagement directly with our products, including the breadth, depth and frequency of use. The size and engagement of our audience is dependent on many factors both within and beyond our control, including significant news events, user sentiment about the quality of our content and products in comparison to our competitors, the free access we provide to our content, and our ability to successfully manage changes implemented by search engines that affect the visibility of our content, among other factors. If users become less engaged with our products, they may be less likely to subscribe.\nWe have set a goal to reach 15 million subscribers by the end of 2027 (from approximately 7.6 million as of year-end 2021) based on our historical performance, as well as internal and external research on the market of adults globally who are paying - or are willing to pay - for English-language news, sports information, puzzles, recipes, expert shopping advice and/or podcasting. The actual size and speed of development of this market, as well as our ability to penetrate this market to grow our subscriber base, are uncertain. Consumers\u2019 willingness to subscribe to our products may depend on a variety of factors, including subscriber engagement, our subscription and pricing model, our ability to adapt to varied and changing consumer expectations, general economic conditions and their potential impact on consumer discretionary spending, and our marketing expenditures and effectiveness, as well as other factors within and outside our control. We may also face additional challenges in expanding our subscriber base to new audiences within and outside of the United States, which is part of our strategy, and the growth of our business could be harmed if our expansion efforts do not succeed. For example, although we have a significant number of users outside of the United States, we could be at a disadvantage compared with local and multinational competitors who may devote more resources to local or regional coverage than we do. Additionally, with our acquisition of The Athletic, we will need to appeal to a new and different subscriber base that currently has modest overlap with the subscriber base of our other products. Our continued expansion will depend on our ability to adapt, on a cost-effective basis, our content, products, pricing and marketing for global audiences. This will include adapting to differences in content preferences; product-feature preferences; culture; language; and market dynamics such as user behavior, spending capability and payment processing systems. As we grow larger and increase our subscriber base, we expect it will become increasingly difficult to maintain our rate of growth.\nWe must also manage the rate at which subscribers cancel their subscriptions to our products - what we refer to as our \u201cchurn.\u201d Subscription cancellations are caused by many and varied reasons, including subscribers\u2019 perception that they do not engage with our content sufficiently, the end of promotional pricing or in response to increases or other adjustments we may implement from time to time in our subscription pricing, changes in local credit card regulations and broader consumer protection regulations, and the expiration of subscribers\u2019 credit cards; they may also be facilitated by the rollout of certain new account management features like the ability to cancel a subscription online. As we adjust our access model to encourage users who may spend less time with our products to subscribe, new subscriber cohorts may not retain at the same rate as prior cohorts of subscribers.\nThe future growth of our business and profitability also depend on our ability to successfully monetize our subscriber relationships and maintain attractive unit economics. We are investing in efforts to encourage subscribers to use and pay for multiple products, primarily through our multi-product package (\u201cbundle\u201d), but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. We have also implemented and may continue to implement changes in our pricing model, such as price increases, that could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract, engage and retain subscribers.\nPrint subscriptions continue to decline as the media industry has transitioned from being primarily print-focused to digital and we do not expect this trend to reverse. As print subscriptions fall, we may be unable to slow the resulting print revenue declines with revenue from home-delivery price increases. In addition, if we are unable to\nP. 10 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\noffset and ultimately replace continued print subscription revenue declines with other sources of revenue, such as digital subscriptions, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to manage and grow the size and profitability of our subscriber base is dependent on metrics that are subject to inherent challenges in measurement.\nWe rely on certain metrics, such as subscriptions, subscribers, average revenue per subscriber and registered users, which we use to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data as well as information we receive from our business affiliates, and are subject to inherent challenges in measurement. For example, there may be individuals who have multiple Times subscriptions or registrations, which we treat as multiple subscribers or registrations, as well as single subscriptions and registrations that are used by more than one person. Accordingly, the calculations of our subscribers and registered users may not reflect the actual number of people using our products. The accuracy of our metrics also depends on accurate reporting by third parties such as Apple and Alphabet, as some of our subscribers purchase their subscriptions through these intermediaries. Inaccuracies in these metrics may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could result in incorrect business decisions and/or affect our longer-term strategies. In addition, as our tools for measuring these metrics evolve, the methodologies for tracking may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics. Real or perceived material inaccuracies in these metrics could harm our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory actions and/or adversely affect our operating and financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to improve and scale our technical and data infrastructure and respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.\nOur ability to attract and retain our users is dependent upon the reliable performance and increasing capabilities of our products and our underlying technical and data infrastructure. As we invest in our array of products and our digital business grows in size, scope and complexity, we must continue to invest in maintaining, integrating, improving and scaling our technical infrastructure. Our failure to do so effectively, or any significant disruption in our service, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss or ineffective monetization of users, and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe continuing rapid evolution of technology in the media industry and changes in the preferences and expectations of consumers also pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:\n\u2022we may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure quickly enough and in a way that meets market and consumer demands;\n\u2022we may fail to successfully manage changes implemented by social media platforms, search engines, news aggregators, mobile app stores and device manufacturers, including those that encourage user engagement with our content in their environments rather than directing users to our products, and those affecting how our content and applications are discovered, prioritized, displayed and monetized;\n\u2022the consumption of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products, the loss of control over distribution of our content and of a direct relationship with our audience, and lower engagement and subscription rates;\n\u2022consumers may increasingly use technology that decreases our ability to enforce limits on the free access we provide to our content and/or obtain useful information with respect to the behavior of users who engage with our products; and\n\u2022we may fail to successfully adapt our digital products to meet changing consumer preferences and expectations regarding privacy and security.\nWe continue to invest significant resources to mitigate these potential risks and to build, maintain and evolve our products, data and technology infrastructure. These investments may adversely impact our operating results in the near term and there can be no assurance as to our ability to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors, develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users, or sufficiently improve and scale our technical infrastructure and prevent disruptions in our service. If we are not successful in adapting our technical and data infrastructure and responding to changes in technology and consumer behavior, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 11\nOur advertising revenues are affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions, market dynamics, evolving digital advertising trends and the evolution of our strategy.\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising in our products. Advertising spending is sensitive to overall economic conditions, and our advertising revenues could be adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak or uneven economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities, or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations. Worldwide economic conditions in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, may materially adversely affect our advertising revenues.\nAs the digital advertising market continues to evolve, our ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, our ability to engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage data, and demonstrate the value of our advertising and the effectiveness of our products to advertisers. In determining whether to buy advertising with us, our advertisers consider the demand for our products, demographics of our audience, advertising rates, results observed by advertisers, breadth and perceived effectiveness of advertising offerings and alternative advertising options.\nLarge digital platforms, such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon, which have greater audience reach, audience data and targeting capabilities than we do, command a large share of the digital display advertising market, and we anticipate that this will continue. The remaining market is subject to significant competition among publishers and other content providers, and audience fragmentation. These dynamics have affected, and will likely continue to affect, our ability to attract and retain advertisers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates.\nAdditionally, digital advertising networks and exchanges with real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale also play a significant role in the marketplace and represent another competitive threat. They have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure and the loss of a direct relationship with marketers, especially during periods of economic downturn.\nThe evolving standards for delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology, regulations, policies and practices that adversely affect our ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of advertising (such as blocking the display of advertising, the phase-out of browser support for third-party cookies and of mobile operating systems for advertising identifiers), may also adversely affect our advertising revenues if we are unable to develop effective solutions to mitigate their impact.\nAdditionally, our digital advertising offerings also now include products that use proprietary first-party data - rather than third-party data - to generate predictive insights and help inform our clients\u2019 advertising strategies. Our ability to quickly and effectively evolve these products; the volume, quality, and price of competitive products; and continued changes to industry regulation all have the potential to impact the success of this strategy.\nWe have also taken further steps intended to improve our users\u2019 experiences and retain and grow our subscriber base. For example, in order to improve users\u2019 experiences, we ceased presenting open-market programmatic advertising in our iOS and Android mobile applications. While these changes may result in long-term benefits for our advertising revenue, they have reduced and may further reduce the inventory for some of our digital advertising products and may otherwise impact advertising revenues.\nOur digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies (particularly Alphabet\u2019s ad manager) which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure, could have an adverse impact on our advertising revenues, operating costs and/or operating results.\nAlthough print advertising revenue continues to represent a significant portion of our total advertising revenue (approximately 38% of our total advertising revenues in 2021), the overall proportion continues to decline and we do not expect this trend to reverse. This trend was further accelerated by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and efforts to contain it on some of our traditional print advertisers, such as entertainment and retail. A further decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may reduce the Company\u2019s print and overall advertising revenue.\nP. 12 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of the Company. Negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe The New York Times brand is a powerful and trusted brand with an excellent reputation for high-quality independent journalism and content, and this brand is a key element of our business. Our brand might be damaged by incidents that erode consumer trust (such as negative publicity), a perception that our journalism is unreliable or a decline in the perceived value of independent journalism or general trust in the media, which may be in part as a result of changing political and cultural environments in the United States and abroad or active campaigns by domestic and international political and commercial actors. We may introduce new products or services that users do not like and that may negatively affect our brand. We also may fail to provide adequate customer service, which could erode confidence in our brand. Our brand and reputation could also be adversely impacted by negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, employees, practices (including social and environmental practices) or business affiliates (including advertisers); as well as our potential inability to adequately respond to such negative claims or publicity, even if such claims are untrue. Our reputation could also be damaged by failures of third-party vendors we rely on in many contexts. We are investing in defining and enhancing our brand. These investments are considerable and may not be successful. To the extent our brand and reputation are damaged, our ability to attract and retain readers, subscribers, advertisers and/or employees could be adversely affected, which could in turn have an adverse impact on our business, revenues and operating results.\nThe continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is difficult to predict and creates considerable uncertainty for our business.\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. The pandemic, efforts to contain it, and the resulting disruptions have impacted our business in various ways. There is substantial uncertainty as to the nature and degree of the continued effects of the pandemic over time.\nFor example, during 2020 we experienced significant growth in the number of subscriptions to our digital news and other products, which we believe was attributable in part to an increase in traffic given the news environment and as a result of the pandemic. The rate of digital subscription growth moderated in 2021, although it was our second-best year for net subscription additions, and we do not expect the 2020 growth rate to be indicative of results for future periods. The growth in subscriptions to our products during the pandemic may also in part reflect changes in how our users spend their time during the pandemic, and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may continue to be impacted by patterns of behavior influenced by the course of the pandemic. In addition, revenues from the single-copy and bulk sales of our print newspaper have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected as a result of continued increased levels of remote working and reductions in travel.\nThe worldwide economic slowdown caused by the pandemic led to a significant decline in our advertising revenues in 2020 as advertisers reduced their spending. While we experienced significantly increased demand for advertising in 2021, particularly with respect to digital advertising as the broader advertising market recovered, there is no assurance that this recovery will be sustained, and developments related to the pandemic such as global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, among others, could adversely impact our advertising revenues in the future if our advertisers were to reduce their advertising spend as a result. We expect reduced print advertising spending by businesses that continue to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, along with secular trends, to continue to adversely affect our print advertising revenues, and some of our print advertising revenues may not return to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the pandemic and attempts to contain it have resulted in the postponement and cancellation of live events, and while this impact moderated in 2021, this continues to adversely affect our revenues from live events and related services.\nAs a result of the ongoing pandemic, we altered certain aspects of our operations and the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely. Remote work may heighten operational risk (including cybersecurity risk), result in a decline in productivity or otherwise negatively affect our ability to manage the business. In addition, if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work due to illness, power outages, connectivity issues or other causes that impact our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, our operations may be negatively impacted. We will continue to actively monitor these other comparable issues raised by the pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required or that we determine are appropriate. It is not clear what effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business and financial results.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 13\nThe Times newspaper is printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y., as well as under contract at remote print sites, and significant operational disruptions at these facilities, or at our newsprint suppliers or print and distribution partners, could adversely affect our operating results. If a significant percentage of our College Point employees were unable to work as a result of the pandemic or because of vaccination mandates, our ability to print and distribute the newspaper and other commercial print products in the New York area could be negatively affected. To the extent our newsprint suppliers or print and distribution partners are further affected by financial pressures, labor shortages, supply chain issues or other circumstances relating to Covid-19 that lead to reduced operations or consolidations or closures of print sites and/or distribution routes, this could lead to an increase in costs to print and distribute our newspapers and/or a decrease in revenues if printing and distribution are disrupted.\nThe future impact that the Covid-19 pandemic will have on our business, operations and financial results is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to reliably predict or mitigate, including the extent of variants and resurgences; the effect of ongoing vaccination and mitigation efforts; the impact of the pandemic on economic conditions and the companies with which we do business, including our advertisers; governmental, business and other\u2019s actions in response to the pandemic; and changes in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic, among many other factors. It is also possible that the Covid-19 pandemic may accelerate or worsen the other risks discussed in this section.\nThe international scope of our business exposes us to economic, geopolitical and other risks inherent in foreign operations.\nWe have news bureaus and other offices around the world, and our digital and print products are generally offered globally. We are focused on further expanding the international scope of our business and face the inherent risks associated with doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022government policies and regulations that restrict our products and operations, including censorship or other restrictions on access to our content and products; the expulsion of journalists or other employees; or other restrictive or retaliatory actions or behavior;\n\u2022effectively managing and staffing foreign operations, including complying with local laws and regulations in each different jurisdiction;\n\u2022providing for the safety and security of our journalists and other employees and affiliates;\n\u2022potential economic, legal, political or social uncertainty and volatility in local or global market conditions or catastrophic events (e.g., a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, a pandemic (such as the Covid-19 pandemic), epidemic or outbreak of a disease or severe weather) that could adversely affect the companies with which we do business, cause changes in discretionary spending, restrict our journalists\u2019 travel or otherwise adversely impact our operations and business;\n\u2022navigating local customs and practices;\n\u2022protecting and enforcing our intellectual property and other rights under varying legal regimes;\n\u2022complying with international laws and regulations, including those governing intellectual property, libel and defamation, labor and employment, tax, payment processing, consumer privacy and the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer and staff data;\n\u2022restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership, foreign investment or repatriation of funds;\n\u2022higher-than-anticipated costs of entry; and\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply.\nP. 14 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nAttracting and maintaining a talented and diverse workforce, which is vital to our success, is increasingly challenging and costly; failure to do so could have a negative impact on our competitive position, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract, develop and maximize the contributions of world-class talent, and to create the conditions for our people to do their best work, is vital to the continued success of our mission and business and central to our long-term strategy. Talent is in high demand, particularly journalists and people working in digital product development disciplines. Our employees and individuals we seek to hire are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies, some of which have greater resources than we have and may offer compensation packages that are perceived to be better than ours. As a result, we may not be able to retain our existing employees or hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs.\nOur continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled talent from diverse backgrounds for all areas of our organization depends on many factors, including our reputation; workplace culture; progress with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; and the compensation and benefits we provide. Employee-related costs are our main operating costs, and these costs have increased in recent years as we have invested in our business and competed for talent, and may further increase. Stock-based compensation is an increasing component of our overall compensation costs, and if the perceived value of our equity awards relative to our competitors declines, including as a result of volatility or declines in the market price of our Class A common stock or changes in perception about our future prospects, that may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain talent. We must also continue to adapt to ever-changing workplace and workforce dynamics and other changes in the business and cultural landscape. We plan to transition to a hybrid work model, with employees working both from our offices and remotely, which may challenge our corporate culture, make us undesirable to talent that prefers different working arrangements, pressure our operations and introduce additional costs as we invest in our offices and technological improvements to support hybrid work. Failing to adapt effectively to these changes or to otherwise meet workforce expectations could impact our ability to compete effectively (including for talent) or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture or operations. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success, and a failure to effectively ensure the transfer of knowledge and train and integrate new employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. If we are unable to attract and maintain a talented and diverse workforce, it would negatively disrupt our operations and our ability to complete ongoing projects; would impact our competitive position and reputation; and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor agreements were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nApproximately 38% of our full-time equivalent employees were represented by unions as of December 26, 2021, including certain employees at Wirecutter who formed a union in 2019. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment with many of our employees collectively. In addition, some of our technology employees are seeking to form a union. Our business and results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations, or if a larger percentage of our employees were to unionize. If we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms, or if we were to experience significant labor unrest or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise, our ability to produce and deliver our products could be impaired. Labor unrest or campaigns by labor organizations have resulted in and may continue to result in negative publicity, which can adversely impact our reputation and our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talent, as well as divert management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, our ability to make adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs, change our strategy or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be further limited by the terms and duration of our collective bargaining agreements.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are party to litigation, including matters relating to alleged libel or defamation and employment-related matters, as well as regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding certain matters. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 15\ncan have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, harm to our reputation, and other factors.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investments\nWe incurred substantial costs in our recent acquisitions of The Athletic, and our future investments in connection with the acquisition may prove costlier than we anticipate. As a result, we may not realize the expected benefits as and when we have forecasted or at all.\nWe completed the acquisition of The Athletic, a global digital subscription-based sports media business, on February 1, 2022 for an all-cash price of approximately $550 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. We also incurred significant non-recurring expenses in connection with this acquisition, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, integration planning and other expenses. We intend to invest additional amounts in an effort to scale The Athletic\u2019s subscriptions business, build its advertising business and make The Athletic, which operated at a loss prior to the acquisition, accretive to our overall profitability.\nIn addition, while we intend to operate The Athletic as a standalone product, we expect that it will still require significant attention and resources from our management team and others working on the transition. This will include the implementation of public company policies and procedures, including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, legal standards and compliance and information security practices. Devoting resources to this integration of The Athletic into the Company means that these resources will be redeployed to varying degrees from their normal day-to-day activities. This could impair our effectiveness and efficiency and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe success of The Athletic acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to apply our subscription, advertising, marketing and operational expertise to help scale their growth in a profitable, efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to manage The Athletic successfully, or doing so may be costlier than we anticipate, and we may experience difficulty in realizing the expected benefits of this acquisition. Potential difficulties that may be encountered may include the loss of key employees, unknown liabilities, unforeseen expenses and/or other complexities associated with the integration.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance about the impact of The Athletic on our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline.\nOur publicly announced guidance and expectations with respect to the impact of The Athletic acquisition on our revenue growth and operating results are based on forecasts prepared by our management. Forecasts are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies relating to our business, many of which are beyond our control and/or are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, which may change. While all guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, guidance relating to the anticipated results of operations of a recently acquired business is inherently more speculative in nature than other guidance as management will, necessarily, be less familiar with the business, procedures and operations of the recently acquired business. It is possible that some or all of our assumptions regarding The Athletic underlying any guidance furnished by us may turn out not to be correct and actual results may vary significantly from our guidance.\nOur business will be impacted by risks applicable to The Athletic.\nWhile we intend to operate The Athletic as a standalone product, its results will be consolidated with ours and accordingly, from the completion of the acquisition, our results are subject to risks and uncertainties affecting its business. These risks include many of the risks outlined elsewhere in these risk factors, as well as others. In our review of The Athletic in connection with the acquisition, we may have failed to identify or fully prepare for all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges facing the business, including issues related to intellectual property, privacy, data protection, information security practices, regulatory compliance practices and tax and employment practices. To the extent unexpected liabilities arise, our recourse to the former owners of The Athletic will be limited and our remedies under customary representation and warranty insurance we obtained in connection with the acquisition may not be adequate to offset such liabilities. As a result, any such liabilities, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nP. 16 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nInvestments we make in new and existing products and services expose us to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to enhance and expand our existing products and services and to acquire and develop new products and services. These investments have included, in addition to The Athletic, among others: enhancements to our core news product and other products (including Games, Cooking, Audm and Wirecutter); investments in various audio, film and television and children\u2019s product initiatives; and investments in our commercial printing and other ancillary operations. These efforts present numerous risks and challenges, including the need for us to appeal to new audiences, develop additional expertise in certain areas, overcome technological and operational challenges and effectively allocate capital resources; new and/or increased costs (including marketing costs and costs to recruit, integrate and retain talented employees); risks associated with strategic relationships such as content licensing; new competitors (some of which may have more resources and experience in certain areas); and additional legal and regulatory risks from expansion into new areas. As a result of these and other risks and challenges, growth into new areas may divert internal resources and the attention of our management and other personnel, including journalists and product and technology specialists.\nAlthough we believe we have a strong and well-established reputation as a global media company, our ability to market our products effectively, and to gain and maintain an audience, particularly for some of our new digital products, is not certain, and if they are not favorably received, our brand may be adversely affected. Even if our new products and services, or enhancements to existing products and services, are favorably received, they may not advance our business strategy as expected, may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities and may fall short of expected return on investment targets or fail to generate sufficient revenue to justify our investments, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, investments and other transactions could adversely affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nIn order to position our business to take advantage of growth opportunities, we intend to continue to engage in discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible additional acquisitions, divestitures, investments and other transactions. We may also consider the acquisition of, or investment in, specific properties, businesses or technologies that fall outside our traditional lines of business and diversify our portfolio, including those that may operate in new and developing industries, if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive.\nAcquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating acquired businesses (including cultural challenges associated with transitioning employees from the acquired company into our organization);\n\u2022failure to identify in advance liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims;\n\u2022diversion of management attention from other business concerns or resources;\n\u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u2022possible dilution of our brand or harm to our reputation;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022risks associated with new strategic relationships;\n\u2022risks associated with integrating financial reporting, internal control and information technology systems; and\n\u2022other unanticipated problems and liabilities.\nCompetition for certain types of acquisitions is significant. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy, may cause us to incur unanticipated costs or liabilities, may result in write-offs of impaired assets, and may fall short of expected return on investment targets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 17\nIn addition, we have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to our business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees and possible retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business.\nFinally, we have made investments in companies, and we may make similar investments in the future. Investments in these businesses subject us to the operating and financial risks of these businesses and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. Our investments are generally illiquid and the absence of a market may inhibit our ability to dispose of them. In addition, if the book value of an investment were to exceed its fair value, we would be required to recognize an impairment charge related to the investment.\nRisks Related to Our Operating Costs\nThe nature of significant portions of our expenses may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur main operating costs are employee-related costs, and these costs have increased in recent years as we have invested in our business and competed for talent that is in high demand, and may further increase. Employee-related costs generally do not decrease proportionately with revenues. In addition, our ability to make short-term adjustments to manage our costs or to make changes to our business strategy may be limited by certain of our collective bargaining agreements. If we were unable to implement cost-control efforts or reduce our operating costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe size and volatility of our pension plan obligations may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe sponsor a frozen single-employer defined benefit pension plan. Although we have frozen participation and benefits under our single-employer plan and have taken other steps to reduce the size and volatility of our pension plan obligations, our results of operations will be affected by the amount of income or expense we record for, and the contributions we are required to make to, this plan.\nIn addition, the Company and the NewsGuild of New York jointly sponsor a defined benefit plan that continues to accrue active benefits for employees represented by the NewsGuild.\nWe are required to make contributions to our plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing those plans. As of December 26, 2021, our qualified defined benefit pension plans had plan assets that were approximately $74 million above the present value of future benefit obligations. Our obligation to make additional contributions to our plans, and the timing of any such contributions, depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These include legislative changes; assumptions about mortality; and economic conditions, including a low interest rate environment or sustained volatility and disruption in the stock and bond markets, which impact discount rates and returns on plan assets.\nAs a result of required contributions to our qualified pension plans, we may have less cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, the Company sponsors several non-qualified pension plans, with unfunded obligations totaling $239 million as of December 26, 2021. Although we have frozen participation and benefits under all but one of these plans, and have taken other steps to reduce the size and volatility of our obligations under these plans, a number of factors, including changes in discount rates or mortality tables, may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe participate in, and make periodic contributions to, various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former production and delivery employees and a small number of voice actors who work on Audm, our read-aloud audio service. Our required contributions to certain plans have increased as our commercial printing operations have expanded.\nP. 18 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nThe risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer withdraws from or otherwise ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, other funding deficiencies, or potential legislative action. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits.\nIf a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. In addition, under federal pension law, special funding rules apply to multiemployer pension plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201ccritical and declining.\u201d When a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate enters \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201ccritical and declining\u201d status, we can be required to make additional contributions and/or benefit reductions may apply. Currently, three of the significant multiemployer plans in which we participate are classified as \u201ccritical and declining.\u201d\nWe have recorded significant withdrawal liabilities with respect to multiemployer pension plans in which we formerly participated (primarily in connection with the sales of the New England Media Group in 2013 and the Regional Media Group in 2012) and may record additional liabilities in the future. In addition, due to declines in our contributions, we have recorded withdrawal liabilities for actual and estimated partial withdrawals from several plans in which we continue to participate. Until demand letters from some of the multiemployer pension funds are received, the exact amount of the withdrawal liability will not be fully known and, as such, a difference from the recorded estimate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. All of the significant multiemployer plans in which we participate are specific to the newspaper and broader printing and publishing industries, which continue to undergo significant pressure. A withdrawal by a significant percentage of participating employers may result in a mass withdrawal declaration by the trustees of one or more of these plans, which would require us to record additional withdrawal liabilities.\nIf, in the future, we elect to withdraw from these plans or if we trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units or a partial cessation of our obligation to contribute, additional liabilities would need to be recorded that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Legislative changes could also affect our funding obligations or the amount of withdrawal liability we incur if a withdrawal were to occur.\nSignificant disruptions in our newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels, or a significant increase in the costs to print and distribute our newspaper, would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe Times newspaper, as well as other commercial print products, are printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y. Outside of the New York area, The Times is printed and distributed under contracts with print and distribution partners across the United States and internationally.\nOur production and distribution facility and our print partners rely on suppliers for deliveries of newsprint, and the availability of newsprint supply may be affected by various factors, including supply chain disruptions, transportation issues, labor shortages or unrest, and other disruptions that may affect production or deliveries of newsprint. In addition, the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and could increase as a result of various factors. A significant disruption in our or our partners\u2019 newsprint supply chain, or a significant increase in the price of newsprint, would adversely affect our operating results.\nTo the extent that financial pressures, newspaper industry trends or economics, labor shortages or unrest, or other circumstances affect our print and distribution partners and/or lead to reduced operations or consolidations or closures of print sites and/or distribution routes, this could increase the cost of printing and distributing our newspapers and/or decrease our revenues if printing and distribution are disrupted. Some of our print and distribution partners have taken steps to reduce their geographic scope and/or the frequency with which newspapers are printed and distributed that have not been reversed, and additional partners may take similar steps. The geographic scope and frequency with which newspapers are printed and distributed by our partners at times affects our ability to print and distribute our newspaper and can adversely affect our operating results.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 19\nIf we experience significant disruptions in our newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels, or a significant increase in the costs to print and distribute our newspaper, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Other Technology\nSecurity breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively and damage our reputation.\nOur systems store and process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal and Company data, and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance. In addition, we rely on the technology and systems provided by third-party vendors (including cloud-based service providers) for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, administrative functions (including payroll processing and certain finance and accounting functions) and other operations.\nWe regularly face attempts by malicious actors to breach our security and compromise our information technology systems. These attackers may use a blend of technology and social engineering techniques (including denial of service attacks, phishing attempts intended to induce our employees and users to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, and other techniques) to disrupt service or exfiltrate data. Information security threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We and the third parties with which we work may be more vulnerable to the risk from activities of this nature as a result of operational changes such as significant increases in remote working. To date, no incidents have had, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our systems, and those of the third parties with which we work and on which we rely, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from the effects of natural disasters or climate change (such as increased storm severity and flooding); fires; power, systems or internet outages; acts of terrorism; pandemics (such as Covid-19); or other similar events.\nWe have implemented controls and taken other preventative measures designed to strengthen our systems against such incidents and attacks, including measures designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at our third-party vendors. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our products, services and systems. Although the costs of the controls and other measures we have taken to date have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the costs and effort to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified in the future could be significant.\nThere can also be no assurance that the actions, measures and controls we have implemented will be effective against future attacks or be sufficient to prevent a future security breach or other disruption to our network or information systems, or those of our third-party providers, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Such an event could result in a disruption of our services, improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, or theft or misuse of our intellectual property, all of which could harm our reputation, require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, or otherwise adversely affect our business. While we maintain cyber risk insurance, the costs relating to any data breach could be substantial, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses related to any future breaches of our systems.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations with respect to privacy, data protection and consumer marketing practices could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations of local and foreign jurisdictions with respect to privacy and the collection and use of personal data, as well as laws and regulations with respect to consumer marketing practices.\nP. 20 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nVarious federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions, govern the processing (including the collection, use, retention and sharing) and security of the data we receive from and about individuals. Failure to protect confidential data, provide individuals with adequate notice of our privacy policies or obtain required valid consent, for example, could subject us to liabilities imposed by these jurisdictions. Existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, as well as foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union imposes stringent data protection requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance; California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act and Consumer Privacy Rights Act, and associated regulations, create new data privacy rights; and the European Union\u2019s forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation is expected to impose, with respect to electronic communications, stricter data protection and data processing requirements.\nIn addition, various federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the laws of foreign jurisdictions, govern the manner in which we market our subscription products, including with respect to subscriptions, billing and automatic-renewal. These laws and regulations often differ across jurisdictions and continue to evolve. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers.\nExisting and newly adopted laws and regulations with respect to privacy, the collection and use of personal data, and consumer marketing practices (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) have imposed and may continue to impose obligations that may affect our business, place increasing demands on our technical infrastructure and resources, require us to incur increased compliance costs and cause us to further adjust our advertising or marketing practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with laws and regulations that govern our business operations, as well as any failure, or perceived failure, by us or the third parties upon which we rely to comply with our own posted policies, could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others, negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users and advertisers. Each of these potential consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\nWe accept payments through third parties using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards and direct debit. We rely on third parties\u2019 systems as well as our own internal systems to process payments. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain certifications, rules, regulations and industry standards. To the extent that there are disruptions in our or third-party payment processing systems, errors in charges made to subscribers, material changes in the payment ecosystem such as large re-issuances of payment cards by credit card issuers, and/or changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payment processing, we could experience increased costs and/or be subject to fines and/or civil liability, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have experienced, and from time to time may continue to experience, fraudulent use of payment methods for subscriptions to our digital products. If we are unable to adequately control and manage this practice, it could result in inaccurately inflated subscription figures used for internal planning purposes and public reporting, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and harm our reputation. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, our card approval rate may be impacted and card networks could impose fines and additional card authentication requirements, or terminate our ability to process payments which would impact our business and results of operations as well as result in negative consumer perceptions of our brand. We have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud but these measures may not be effective and may need to be continually improved as fraudulent schemes become more sophisticated. These measures may add friction to our subscription processes, which could adversely affect our ability to add new subscribers.\nThe termination of our ability to accept payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business, including our ability to add and retain subscribers and collect subscription and advertising revenues, and would adversely affect our results of operations.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 21\nDefects, delays or interruptions in the cloud-based hosting services we utilize could adversely affect our reputation and operating results.\nWe currently utilize third-party subscription-based software services as well as public cloud infrastructure services to provide solutions for many of our computing and bandwidth needs. Any interruptions to these services generally could result in interruptions in service to our subscribers and advertisers and/or the Company\u2019s critical business functions, notwithstanding any business continuity or disaster recovery plans or agreements that may currently be in place with some of these providers. This could result in unanticipated downtime and/or harm to our operations, reputation and operating results. A transition of these services to different cloud providers would be difficult to implement and cause us to incur significant time and expense. In addition, if hosting costs increase over time and/or if we require more computing or storage capacity as a result of subscriber growth or otherwise, our costs could increase disproportionately.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including our valuable brand, content, services and internally developed technology. We believe the protection and monetization of our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property are critical to our continued success and our competitive position. Unauthorized parties have unlawfully misappropriated our brand, content, services, technology and other intellectual property or may attempt to do so, and the measures we have taken to protect and enforce our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to fully address or prevent all third-party infringement.\nThe Internet, combined with advancements in technology, has made unauthorized copying and wide dissemination of unlicensed content easier, including by anonymous foreign actors. At the same time, enforcement of our intellectual property rights has become more challenging. As our business and the presence and impact of bad actors become more global in scope, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost-effective manner in other jurisdictions. In addition, intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet.\nIf we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not succeed in realizing the full value of our assets, and our business, brand and profitability may suffer. In addition, if we must litigate in the United States or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation may be costly and time consuming.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business.\nWe periodically receive claims from third parties alleging violations of their intellectual property rights. To the extent the Company gains greater public recognition and scale worldwide, and publishes more content on its own platforms and third-party platforms (like social media), the likelihood of receiving claims of infringement may rise. Defending against intellectual property infringement claims against us can be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and a diversion of management attention. In addition, litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters.\nIf successful, third-party intellectual property infringement claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, use more costly alternative technology, alter how we present our content to our users, alter certain of our operations and/or otherwise incur substantial monetary liability. The occurrence of any of these events as a result of these claims could result in substantially increased costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For claims against us, insurance may be insufficient or unavailable, and for claims related to actions of third parties, either indemnification or remedies against those parties may be insufficient or unavailable.\nP. 22 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nRisks Related to the Terms of Our Debt and Common Stock\nThe terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations that could limit our ability to undertake certain actions.\nIn September 2019, we entered into a $250 million five-year unsecured credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facility. As of December 26, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. See \u201cNote 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a description of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants and various incurrence-based negative covenants imposing potentially significant restrictions on our operations. These covenants restrict, subject to various exceptions, our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur debt (directly or by third-party guarantees);\n\u2022grant liens;\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022make acquisitions or dispositions; and\n\u2022prepay debt.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nWe may not have access to the capital markets on terms that are acceptable to us or may otherwise be limited in our financing options.\nFrom time to time the Company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. The Company\u2019s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to (1) the Company\u2019s financial performance; (2) the Company\u2019s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating; (3) liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it.\nIn addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing to support operations or to fund acquisitions or other capital-intensive initiatives.\nOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, through a family trust, and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control.\nWe have two classes of stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to elect 30% of the Board of Directors and to vote, with holders of Class B Common Stock, on the reservation of shares for equity grants, certain material acquisitions and the ratification of the selection of our auditors. Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to elect the remainder of the Board of Directors and to vote on all other matters. Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, who purchased The Times in 1896. A family trust holds approximately 95% of the Class B Common Stock. As a result, the trust has the ability to elect 70% of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of the Class A Common Stock. Under the terms of the trust agreement, the trustees are directed to retain the Class B Common Stock held in trust and to vote such stock against any merger, sale of assets or other transaction pursuant to which control of The Times passes from the trustees, unless they determine that the primary objective of the trust can be achieved better by the implementation of such transaction. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 23", "PERMNO": 47466, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NYT"}
