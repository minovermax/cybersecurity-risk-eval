RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report, in analyzing an investment in our common stock. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that may appear immaterial, also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements, whether made in this annual report or future quarterly reports to stockholders, press releases, or oral statements, whether in presentations, responses to questions, or otherwise.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous risks.\nOn September 21, 2014, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Viasystems and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Viasystems, with Viasystems surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. This transaction and any other acquisitions we may pursue in the future involve numerous risks. As part of our business strategy, we expect that we will continue to grow by pursuing acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets, or product lines that complement or expand our business. Risks related to an acquisition may include:\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and businesses or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale, or other expected value;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our existing business to focus on integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the newly acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing production and coordinating operations at new sites;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to retain existing customers of acquired companies when we desire to do so;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential decrease in overall gross margins associated with acquiring a business with a different product mix;\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify certain unrecorded liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe potential need to restructure, modify, or terminate customer relationships of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nan increased concentration of business from existing or new customers; and\n\u2022\nthe potential inability to identify assets best suited to our business plan.\nAcquisitions may cause us to:\n\u2022\nenter lines of business and/or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022\nissue debt and be required to abide by stringent loan covenants;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities; record goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation and environmental issues, which include product material content certifications;\n\u2022\nincur unanticipated costs;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u2022\nincur substantial transaction-related costs, whether or not a proposed acquisition is consummated.\nAcquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions will be successful and will not harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion. In addition, unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after the acquisition.\nWe are subject to risks of currency fluctuations.\nA portion of our cash and other current assets is held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As of December 29, 2014, we had an aggregate of approximately $207.4 million in current assets denominated in Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the value of these assets as translated to U.S. dollars in our balance sheet. To the extent that we ultimately decide to repatriate some portion of these funds to the United States, the actual value transferred could be impacted by movements in exchange rates. Any such type of movement could negatively impact the amount of cash available to fund operations or to repay debt. Significant inflation or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the RMB and the U.S. dollar and the HKD cannot be predicted. To the extent that we may have outstanding indebtedness denominated in the U.S. dollar or in the HKD, the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar or the HKD will have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations (including the cost of servicing, and the value in our balance sheet of, the U.S. dollar and HKD-denominated indebtedness). Further, China\u2019s government imposes controls over the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies, which subjects us to further currency exchange risk.\nProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us.\nWe manufacture products to our customers\u2019 specifications, which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures, despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, manufacturing, or materials failure or error, may result in delayed shipments, customer dissatisfaction, a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders, or liability claims against us. If these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may be impaired. Since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers\u2019 businesses, errors, defects, or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the PCB, for which we may be liable. Although our invoices and sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions. Over the last two years, we have incurred charges, after giving effect to indemnity payments from one of our suppliers, in excess of $8.0 million, relating to a product warranty claim with one of our customers. See \u201c- We depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d\nIn addition, after the consummation of the Merger, we expect to manufacture products for a range of automotive customers. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of such products. As suppliers become more integral to the vehicle design process and assume more of\nthe vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. In addition, vehicle manufacturers, which have traditionally borne the costs associated with warranty programs offered on their vehicles, are increasingly requiring suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of the costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied by us to the vehicle manufacturer.\nProduct liability litigation against us, even if unsuccessful, is time consuming and costly to defend. Although we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance, we cannot assure investors that we will continue to be able to purchase such insurance coverage in the future on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all, or that insurance will cover the specific defect issues that arise.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the worldwide electronics industry, which is characterized by economic cycles and fluctuations in product demand. A downturn in the electronics industry or prolonged global economic crisis could result in decreased demand for our manufacturing services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from the electronics industry, which is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. The industry is subject to economic cycles and recessionary periods. Due to the uncertainty in the end markets served by most of our customers, we have a low level of visibility with respect to future financial results. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings, and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings, and cash flows.\nWe depend upon a relatively small number of OEM customers for a large portion of our sales, and a decline in sales to major customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA small number of customers is responsible for a significant portion of our sales. Our five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 44%, 41%, and 33% of our net sales for the years ended December 29, 2014, December 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, and one customer represented 21% of our sales for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2014. Sales attributed to OEMs include both direct sales as well as sales that the OEMs place through EMS providers. Our customer concentration could fluctuate, depending on future customer requirements, which will depend in large part on market conditions in the electronics industry segments in which our customers participate. The loss of one or more significant customers or a decline in sales to our significant customers would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, during industry downturns, we may need to reduce prices to limit the level of order losses, and we may be unable to collect payments from our customers. There can be no assurance that key customers would not cancel orders, that they would continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as experienced by us in prior periods, that they would be able to meet their payment obligations, or that the end-products which use our products would be successful. This concentration of customer base may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations due to the loss or cancellation of business from any of these key customers, significant changes in scheduled deliveries to any of these customers, or decreases in the prices of the products sold to any of these customers.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins would continue to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization would depend on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to\noffer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve expected gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long-lived assets change in the future, significant impairment charges could result that would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our quick turnaround production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance, other exit costs, and asset impairments as well as potentially causing disruptions in our ability to supply customers.\nOur results of operations are often subject to demand fluctuations and seasonality. With a high level of fixed operating costs, even small revenue shortfalls would decrease our gross margins.\nOur results of operations fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of orders from and shipments to major customers;\n\u2022\nthe levels at which we utilize our manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in our mix of revenues generated from quick-turn versus standard delivery time services;\n\u2022\nexpenditures, charges or write-offs, including those related to acquisitions, facility restructurings, or asset impairments; and\n\u2022\nexpenses relating to expanding existing manufacturing facilities.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins. In addition, we have experienced sales fluctuations due to seasonal patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles, as well as inventory management practices of our customers and the end markets we serve. In particular, the seasonality of the computer and cellular phone industries and quick-turn ordering patterns affect the overall PCB industry. These seasonal trends have caused fluctuations in our operating results in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. In addition, our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur results can be adversely affected by rising labor costs.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to rising labor costs, particularly within China, where we have most of our manufacturing facilities. In recent periods there have been regular and significant increases in the minimum wage payable in various provinces of China. In addition, we have experienced very high employee turnover in our manufacturing facilities in China, generally after the Chinese New Year, and we are experiencing ongoing difficulty in recruiting employees for these facilities. Furthermore, labor disputes and strikes based partly on wages have in the past slowed or stopped production by certain manufacturers in China. In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the high turnover rate and our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and the other labor trends we are noting in China could result in a potential for defects in our products or production disruptions or delays or the inability to ramp production to meet increased customer orders, resulting in order cancellation or imposition of customer penalties if we are unable to timely deliver products.\nTo respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, we may further expand internationally in lower cost locations. If we pursue such expansions, we may be required to make additional capital expenditures. In addition, the cost structure in certain countries that are now considered to be favorable may increase as economies develop or as such countries join multinational economic communities or organizations, causing local wages to rise. As a result, we may need to continue to seek new locations with lower costs and the employee and infrastructure base to support PCB manufacturing. We cannot assure investors that we will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of our international operations or that our international operations will contribute positively to our operating results.\nIn our North America operating segment, rising health care costs pose a significant labor-related risk. We work with our insurance brokers and carriers to control the cost of health care for our employees. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will succeed, especially given recent and pending changes in government oversight of health care.\nEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of engineering and manufacturing personnel. As of December 29, 2014, approximately 12,180 of our employees were represented by unions, which accounted for approximately 72% of our work force. These unionized employees are all based in China, where we have significant manufacturing facilities. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages. Any of these events could be disruptive to our operations and could result in negative publicity, loss of contracts, and a decrease in revenues. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees or segments of our workforce become unionized, including any of our employees in the United States. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in a work stoppage, except for a brief work stoppage associated with the announcement of the closure of our Suzhou, China facility in September 2013.\nWe serve customers and have manufacturing facilities outside the United States and are subject to the risks characteristic of international operations.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations in Asia, and sales offices located in Asia and Europe, and we continue to consider additional opportunities to make foreign investments and construct new foreign facilities.\nFor the year ended December 29, 2014, we generated 67% of our net sales from non-U.S. operations, and a significant portion of our manufacturing material was provided by international suppliers during this period. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to significant international operations, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanaging international operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of governmental controls;\n\u2022\nunstable regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ncompliance with employment laws;\n\u2022\nimplementation of disclosure controls, internal controls, financial reporting systems, and governance standards to comply with U.S. accounting and securities laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on imports or exports of our product offerings;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of local currencies;\n\u2022\ninflation or changes in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest, rising wages, difficulties in staffing and geographical labor shortages;\n\u2022\ngovernment or political unrest;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nlanguage and communication barriers as well as time zone differences;\n\u2022\ncultural differences;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties and taxation levied on our products;\n\u2022\nother potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ntravel restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of private enterprises; and\n\u2022\nthe potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign investment and trade.\nOur operations in China subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China.\nUnder its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. No assurance can be given, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successful if pursued, or that such policies will not be significantly altered from time to time. Despite progress in developing its legal system, China does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws, particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade. Enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent. As the Chinese legal system develops, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. Further, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, though changes in government policies and rules are timely published or communicated, there is usually no indication of the duration of any grace period before which full implementation and compliance will be required. As a result, we may operate our business in violation of new rules and policies before full compliance can be achieved. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business, which involves unique risks. Changes in government defense spending or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from products and services ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our OEM and EMS customers and is therefore affected by, among other things, the federal budget process. We are a supplier, primarily as a subcontractor, to the U.S. government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies. The contracts between our direct customers and the government end user are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks, such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.\nFor the year ended December 29, 2014, aerospace and defense sales accounted for approximately 16% of our total net sales. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. While we do not sell any significant volume of products directly to the U.S. government, we are a supplier to the U.S. government and its agencies as well as foreign governments and agencies. Consequently, our sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments and may be affected by federal budget sequestration measures. On December 26, 2013, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (the \u201cBBA\u201d) into law, which reduced the Department of Defense (DoD) budget uncertainty for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 by increasing Budget Control Act of 2011 spending caps and lowering sequester cuts to the DoD base budget by $22 billion for fiscal year 2014 and $9 billion for fiscal year 2015. Additionally, Congress also increased the 2014 Overseas Contingency Operations budget by $6 billion more than the amount included in the 2014 Proposed Budget Request. Declines in the DoD budgets reduce funding for some of our revenue arrangements and generally will have a negative impact on our sales, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe domestic and international threat of terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions in the recent past. The U.S. government, however, is facing unprecedented budgeting constraints and the U.S. defense budget is currently declining as a result of budgetary pressures and the wind down of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The termination or failure to fund one or more significant contracts by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the federal government is currently in the process of reviewing and revising the U.S. Munitions List. Such changes could reduce or eliminate restrictions that currently apply to some of the products we produce. If these regulations or others are changed in a manner that reduces restrictions on products being manufactured overseas, we would likely face an increase in the number of competitors and increased price competition from overseas manufacturers, who are restricted by the current export laws from manufacturing products for U.S. defense systems.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for our facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite to our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. government.\nA facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and perform on classified contracts for the DoD and certain other agencies of the U.S. government. As a cleared entity, we must comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), and any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations. Further, due to the fact that a significant portion of our voting equity is owned by a non-U.S. entity, we are required to be governed by and operate in accordance with the terms and requirements of the Special Security Agreement (the \u201cSSA\u201d). See \u201cBusiness - National Security Matters.\u201d\nIf we were to violate the terms and requirements of the SSA, the NISPOM, or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations (which may apply to us under the terms of classified contracts), we could lose our security clearance. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform on classified contracts and would not be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nWe rely on the telecommunications industry for a significant portion of sales. Accordingly, the economic volatility in this industry has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our ability to forecast demand and production and to meet desired sales levels.\nA large percentage of TTM\u2019s business is conducted with customers who are in the telecommunications industry and, after the consummation of the Merger, a large percentage of our business after giving effect to the Merger is expected to continue to be conducted with such customers. This industry is characterized by intense competition, relatively short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product demand. This industry is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand patterns of those markets. If the volatility in this industry continues, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we could lose market share if we are unable to maintain our current competitive position in end markets using our quick-turn, high technology, and high-mix manufacturing services.\nThe PCB industry is intensely competitive, highly fragmented, and rapidly changing. We expect competition to continue, which could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include Unimicron Technology Corp., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., Compeq Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Tripod Technology Corp., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Viasystems Group, Inc., Sanmina Corporation, Multek Corporation, Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd., and AT&S Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik AG. Our principal backplane assembly competitors include Amphenol Corp, Sanmina Corporation, Viasystems Group, Inc., and TT Electronics PLC. In addition, we increasingly compete on an international basis, and new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our markets.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and manufacturing resources that can be devoted to the development, production, and sale of their products;\n\u2022\nmore established and broader sales and marketing channels;\n\u2022\nmore manufacturing facilities worldwide, some of which are closer in proximity to OEMs;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing facilities that are located in countries with lower production costs;\n\u2022\nlower capacity utilization, which in peak market conditions can result in shorter lead times to customers;\n\u2022\nability to add additional capacity faster or more efficiently;\n\u2022\npreferred vendor status with existing and potential customers;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition; and\n\u2022\nlarger customer bases.\nIn addition, these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, than we do. We must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers\u2019 needs for complex products, and our manufacturing process technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. During recessionary periods in the electronics industry, our strategy of providing quick-turn services, an integrated manufacturing solution, and responsive customer service may take on reduced importance to our customers. As a result, we may need to compete more on the basis of price, which would cause our gross margins to decline.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to manufacture products that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. We expect that the investment necessary to maintain our technological position will increase as customers make demands for products and services requiring more advanced technology on a quicker turnaround basis. For example, in 2015 we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand our HDI and other advanced manufacturing capabilities. We may not be able to obtain access to additional sources of funds in order to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors.\nIn addition, the PCB industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete. We may not respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market. If we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive, the development, acquisition, and implementation of those technologies and equipment will require us to make significant capital investments.\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and reduce our gross margins.\nTo manufacture PCBs, we use raw materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass, copper foil, chemical solutions, gold, and other commodity products, which we order from our suppliers. In the case of backplane assemblies, components include connectors, sheet metal, capacitors, resistors and diodes, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers\u2019 approved vendors. If raw material and component prices increase, it may reduce our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to provide our customers with high-end technology, high-quality products, and responsive service, or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain our existing customer base and obtain business from new customers, we must demonstrate our ability to produce our products at the level of technology, quality, responsiveness of service, timeliness of delivery, and cost that our customers require. If our products are of substandard quality, if they are not delivered on time, if we are not responsive to our customers\u2019 demands, or if we cannot meet our customers\u2019 technological requirements, our reputation as a reliable supplier of our products would likely be damaged. If we are unable to meet anticipated product and service standards, we may be unable to obtain new contracts or keep our existing customers, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks for the use of certain metals from \u201cconflict minerals\u201d originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries as required by Dodd-Frank. While these new rules continue to be the subject of ongoing litigation and, as a result, uncertainty, we submitted a conflict minerals report on Form SD with the SEC on May 30, 2014. Compliance with these rules is likely to result in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the costs and expenses of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our PCBs, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may, at a minimum, face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be materially adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries and states with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, as well as other factors. Our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities, and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our net earnings do not remain at or above recent levels, or we are not able to predict with a reasonable degree of probability that they will continue, we may have to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets.\nAs of December 29, 2014, TTM had net deferred income tax assets of approximately $2.9 million. Based on our forecast for future taxable earnings, we believe we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future\nperiods. However, if our estimates of future earnings decline, we may have to increase our valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, resulting in a higher income tax provision, which would reduce our cash flows. Additionally, the ability to utilize deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the specific tax jurisdictions that have deferred income tax assets.\nIf events or circumstances occur in our business that indicate that our goodwill and definite-lived intangibles may not be recoverable, we could have impairment charges that would negatively affect our earnings.\nAs of December 29, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $31.4 million of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, which amount will significantly increase after the application of purchase accounting to the Merger. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred, such that the potential for reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with further decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization may indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that assets are impaired, we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, which could harm our results during the periods in which such a reduction is recognized. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2012 our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the carrying value of goodwill for our Asia Pacific reporting unit, in our Asia Pacific operating segment, was in excess of fair value, and therefore we recognized an impairment charge of $171.4 million.\nWe will perform our fiscal year 2015 annual impairment test during our fourth fiscal quarter. Given the recent volatility of our market capitalization, it is reasonably possible that we could record an impairment charge by fiscal year end when we conduct our annual impairment test. Our goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets may increase in future periods if we consummate other acquisitions. Amortization and impairment of these additional intangibles would, in turn, reduce our earnings.\nDamage to our manufacturing facilities due to fire, natural disaster, or other events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe destruction or closure of any of our facilities for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, blizzard, act of war or terrorism, flood, tornado, earthquake, lightning, other natural disasters, an outbreak of epidemics such as Ebola or severe acute respiratory syndrome, required maintenance, or other events could harm us financially, increasing our costs of doing business and limiting our ability to deliver our manufacturing services on a timely basis.\nOur insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers\u2019 products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIn the event one or more of our facilities is closed on a temporary or permanent basis as a result of a natural disaster, required maintenance or other event, or in the event that an outbreak of a serious epidemic results in quarantines, temporary closures of offices or manufacturing facilities, travel restrictions or the temporary or permanent loss of key personnel, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production or repair, rebuild or replace the affected manufacturing facilities. This time frame could be lengthy and result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have in place disaster recovery plans, there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man-made disaster, pandemic, required repair or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier.\nWe face constant pricing pressure from our customers and competitors, which may decrease our profit margins.\nCompetition in the PCB market is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. We and some of our competitors have in the past reduced\naverage selling prices. In addition, competitors may reduce their average selling prices faster than our ability to reduce costs, which can also accelerate the rate of decline of our selling prices. When prices decline, we may also be required to write down the value of our inventory.\nThe effects of such pricing pressures on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs of supply. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, this in turn reduces gross profit if we are unable to raise prices. Further, uncertainty or adverse changes in the economy could also lead to a significant decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. As a result of the recent global economic downturn, many businesses have taken a more conservative stance in ordering inventory. Any decrease in demand for our products, coupled with pressure from the market and our customers to decrease our prices, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe pricing pressure we face on our products requires us to introduce new and more advanced technology products to maintain average selling prices or reduce any declines in average selling prices. As we shift production to more advanced, higher density PCBs, we tend to make significant investments in plants and other capital equipment and incur higher costs of production, which may not be recovered.\nThe prominence of EMS companies as our customers could reduce our gross margins, potential sales, and customers.\nSales to EMS companies represented approximately 39%, 38% and 40% of our net sales for the years ended December 29, 2014, December 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Sales to EMS providers include sales directed by OEMs as well as orders placed with us at the EMS providers\u2019 discretion. EMS providers source on a global basis to a greater extent than OEMs. The growth of EMS providers increases the purchasing power of such providers and has in the past, and could in the future, result in increased price competition or the loss of existing OEM customers. In addition, some EMS providers, including some of our customers, have the ability to directly manufacture PCBs and create backplane assemblies. If a significant number of our other EMS customers were to acquire these abilities, our customer base might shrink, and our sales might decline substantially. Moreover, if any of our OEM customers outsource the production of PCBs and creation of backplane assemblies to these EMS providers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in the scope and complexity of our operations. This growth may strain our managerial, financial, manufacturing, and other resources. In order to manage our growth, we may be required to continue to implement additional operating and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations. In addition, growth in our capacity could result in reduced capacity utilization and a corresponding decrease in gross margins.\nOur international sales are subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt practices, trade, and export controls and economic sanctions. Any non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTTM operates on a global basis and is subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to government officials or any other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate and sell our products in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We also, from time to time, undertake business ventures with state-owned companies or enterprises.\nTTM\u2019s global business operations must also comply with all applicable domestic and foreign export control laws, including ITAR, and EAR. Some items manufactured by us are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security under EAR.\nWe train our employees concerning anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-kickback laws and compliance with international regulations regarding trades and exports, and we have policies in place that prohibit employees from making improper payments. We cannot provide assurances that our internal controls and procedures will guarantee compliance by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-kickback laws in international jurisdictions or for violations of ITAR, EAR, or other similar regulations regarding trades and exports, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the inadvertence of others, we could suffer criminal or civil fines or penalties or other repercussions, including reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTTM\u2019s global business operations also must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations, such as laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s OFAC, the U.S. State Department, and the U.S. Department of Commerce. We must comply with all applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including criminal or civil fines or penalties, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business.\nIn certain countries, TTM may engage third-party agents or intermediaries, such as customs agents, to act on each of their behalves, and if these third-party agents or intermediaries violate applicable laws, their actions may result in criminal or civil fines or penalties or other sanctions being assessed against TTM. We take certain measures designed to ensure our compliance with U.S. export and economic sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws and regulations, and export control laws. However, it is possible that some of our products were sold or will be sold to distributors or other parties, without our knowledge or consent, in violation of applicable law. There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance in the future. Any such violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines, penalties, or other sanctions and repercussions, including reputational harm, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the requirements of environmental laws could result in litigation, fines, revocation of permits necessary to our manufacturing processes, or debarment from our participation in federal government contracts.\nOur operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water, as well as the handling, storage, and disposal of such materials. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, as well as analogous state, local, and foreign laws. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because our manufacturing processes use and generate materials classified as hazardous. Because we use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in our manufacturing processes, we may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of our own sites, or sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated. Even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, we may still be liable. The wastes we generate include spent ammoniacal and cupric etching solutions, metal stripping solutions, waste acid solutions, waste alkaline cleaners, waste oil, and waste waters that contain heavy metals such as copper, tin, lead, nickel, gold, silver, cyanide, and fluoride, and both filter cake and spent ion exchange resins from equipment used for on-site waste treatment.\nEnvironmental law violations, including with respect to the failure to maintain required environmental permits, could subject us to fines, penalties, and other sanctions, including the revocation of our effluent\ndischarge permits, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we ultimately prevail, environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend.\nEnvironmental laws have generally become more stringent and this trend may continue over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation. We operate in environmentally sensitive locations, and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business, and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, material storage, handling, or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment or relocation to another global location where prohibitive regulations do not exist. It is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly required to certify compliance with various material content restrictions in our products based on laws of various jurisdictions or territories such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) directives in the European Union and China\u2019s RoHS legislation. Similar laws have been adopted in other jurisdictions and may become increasingly prevalent. In addition, we must also certify as to the non-applicability of the EU\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive for certain products that we manufacture. The REACH directive requires the identification of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) periodically. We must survey our supply chain and certify to the non-presence or presence of SVHCs to our customers. As with other types of product certifications that we routinely provide, we may incur liability and pay damages if our products do not conform to our certifications.\nWe are also subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in China, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The manufacturing of our products generates gaseous chemical wastes, liquid wastes, waste water, and other industrial wastes from various stages of the manufacturing process. Production sites in China are subject to regulation and periodic monitoring by the relevant environmental protection authorities. Environmental claims or the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production, or cessation of operations.\nThe process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to city, county, state, federal, and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes, and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to Chinese environmental waste water law was issued in late 2012, but allows for an interim period in which plants subject to such law may install equipment that meets the new regulatory regime. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the newly adopted environmental regulations. There can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future.\nEmployee theft or fraud could result in loss.\nCertain of our employees have access to, or signature authority with respect to, bank accounts or other company assets, which could expose us to fraud or theft. In addition, certain employees have access to certain precious metals used in connection with our manufacturing and key information technology (IT) infrastructure and to customer and other information that is commercially valuable. Should any employee, for any reason, steal any such precious metals (which has occurred from time to time), compromise our IT systems, or misappropriate customer or other information, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers against us, and the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be debarred from future participation in government programs. Any such losses may not be fully covered by insurance.\nBecause we sell on a purchase order basis, we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers that could decrease revenues and harm our operating results.\nAlthough we have long-term contracts with many customers, those contracts generally do not contain volume commitments. We generally sell to customers on a purchase order basis. Our quick-turn orders are subject to particularly short lead times. Consequently, our sales are subject to short-term variability in demand by our customers. Customers submitting purchase orders may cancel, reduce, or delay their orders for a variety of reasons, subject to negotiations. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers may vary due to:\n\u2022\ncustomer attempts to manage inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 manufacturing strategies, such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of PCB manufacturers or backplane assembly service providers used or to manufacture or assemble its own products internally;\n\u2022\nvariation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\nchanges in new product introductions.\nWe have periodically experienced terminations, reductions, and delays in our customers\u2019 orders. Further terminations, reductions, or delays in our customers\u2019 orders could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them that have restrictive terms and conditions. These agreements typically include provisions that increase our financial exposure, which could result in significant costs to us.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them. These agreements typically do not include volume commitments, but do include provisions that generally serve to increase our exposure for product liability and limited sales returns, which could result in higher costs to us as a result of such claims. In addition, these agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our operational and pricing flexibility and extend payment terms, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their PCB manufacturing and backplane assembly needs to us. If OEMs choose to provide these services in-house or select other providers, our business could suffer.\nOur future revenue growth partially depends on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other providers, our financial results and future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nConsolidation among our customers could adversely affect our business.\nRecently, some of our large customers have consolidated, and further consolidation of customers may occur. Depending on which organization becomes the controller of the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, there does exist the potential for decreased revenue if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. We also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets.\nMost of our sales are on an \u201copen credit\u201d basis, with standard industry payment terms. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit\nto amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. During periods of economic downturn in the electronics industry and the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, such programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks.\nOur five largest OEM customers accounted for approximately 44%, 41% and 33% of our net sales for the years ended December 29, 2014, December 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. Additionally, our OEM customers often direct a significant portion of their purchases through a relatively limited number of EMS companies. Sales to EMS companies represented approximately 39%, 38%, and 40% of our net sales for the years ended December 29, 2014, December 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. Our contractual relationship is often with the EMS companies, who are obligated to pay us for our products. Because we expect our OEM customers to continue to direct our sales to EMS companies, we expect to continue to be subject to this credit risk with a limited number of EMS customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay us, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on suppliers for the timely delivery of raw materials and components used in manufacturing our PCBs and backplane assemblies. If a raw material supplier fails to satisfy our product quality standards, it could harm our customer relationships.\nAlthough we have preferred suppliers for most of our raw materials, the materials we use are generally readily available in the open market, and other potential suppliers exist. The components for backplane assemblies in some cases have limited or sole sources of supply. Consolidations and restructuring in our supplier base may result in adverse materials pricing due to reduction in competition among our suppliers. Furthermore, if a raw material or component supplier fails to satisfy our product quality standards, including standards relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (discussed above in a separate risk factor), it could harm our customer relationships. Suppliers may from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices, due to capacity constraints or other factors, which could harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund investments in our operations, refinance our indebtedness and to maintain and grow our business, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur business is capital-intensive, and our ability to increase revenue, profit, and cash flow depends upon continued capital spending. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements as currently planned, however, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we do not achieve our expected operating results, we would need to reallocate our sources and uses of operating cash flows. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business. Looking ahead at long-term needs, we may need to raise additional funds for a number of purposes, including:\n\u2022\nto fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity, upgrade and expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment or introduce new products;\n\u2022\nto refinance our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nto fund our operations beyond 2015;\n\u2022\nto fund working capital requirements for future growth that we may experience;\n\u2022\nto enhance or expand the range of services we offer;\n\u2022\nto increase our sales and marketing activities; or\n\u2022\nto respond to competitive pressures or perceived opportunities, such as investment, acquisition and international expansion activities.\nShould we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our current debt instruments. There can be no assurance that additional\ncapital would be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. If such funds are not available to us when required or on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Asia Pacific operations could be materially adversely affected by a shortage of utilities or a discontinuation of priority supply status offered for such utilities.\nThe manufacturing of PCBs requires significant quantities of electricity and water. Our Asia Pacific operations have historically purchased substantially all of the electrical power for their manufacturing plants in China from local power plants. Because China\u2019s economy has recently been in a state of growth, the strain on the nation\u2019s power plants is increasing, which has led to continuing power outages in various parts of the country. There may be times when our operations in China may be unable to obtain adequate sources of electricity to meet production requirements. Additionally, we do not generally maintain any back-up power generation facilities for our operations, so if we were to lose power at any of our facilities, we would be required to cease operations until power was restored. Any stoppage of power could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, thus potentially resulting in a loss of business and increased costs of manufacturing. In addition, the sudden cessation of power supply could damage our equipment, resulting in the need for costly repairs or maintenance as well as damage to products in production, resulting in an increase in scrapped products. For example, in the third quarter of 2014, one of our principal plants was affected by a 5 day unexpected power outage, which increased our manufacturing costs. Similarly, the sudden cessation of the water supply to Chinese facilities could adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner, potentially resulting in a loss of business and under-utilization of capacity. Various regions in China have in the past experienced shortages of both electricity and water and unexpected interruptions of power supply. From time to time, the Chinese government rations electrical power, which can lead to unscheduled production interruptions in our manufacturing facilities. There can be no assurance that our required utilities would not in the future experience material interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutages, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events could disrupt our operations, and breaches of our security systems may cause us to incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing, and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions. If we or our vendors are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, our operations could be disrupted. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information systems or such information is used in an unauthorized manner, misdirected, lost, or stolen during transmission, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if any of our key senior executives discontinues employment with us or if we are unable to recruit and retain highly skilled engineering and sales staff.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key managerial employees. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future. We can make no assurances that future changes in executive management will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business also depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified employees, particularly engineering and sales and marketing\npersonnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these employees could harm our business. Further, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition.\nOur manufacturing processes depend on the collective industry experience of our employees. If a significant number of these employees were to leave us, it could limit our ability to compete effectively and could harm our financial results.\nWe have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes to ensure we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry. Although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees, if a significant number of our employees involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment, and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience, our manufacturing processes might suffer as we might be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry. As a result, we may lose our ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, we have experienced a significant amount of employee attrition each year, which has negatively impacted our yield, costs of production, and service times.\nWe may be exposed to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties that could be costly to defend, could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and if successful, could result in liability.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only limited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We may not have the controls and procedures in place that are needed to adequately protect proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. As is the case with many other companies in the PCB industry, we from time to time receive communications from third parties asserting patent rights to our products and enter into discussions with such third parties. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement. If any claims are brought against the customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defending such claims. In the event we are subject to any infringement claims, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or in obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all, which could disrupt the production processes, damage our reputation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change initiatives.\nOur manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy sources and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials that are derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nLegal proceedings in connection with the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger.\nSince the public announcement of the Merger Agreement on September 22, 2014, Viasystems, TTM, Merger Sub, and the members of the Viasystems Board have been named as defendants in two putative class action complaints challenging the Merger. The first lawsuit, filed in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, and the second lawsuit, filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, generally allege, among other things, that the Merger fails to properly value Viasystems, that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties in approving the Merger Agreement and that those breaches were aided and abetted by TTM, Merger Sub, and Viasystems. The Lawsuits seek, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, rescinding, to the extent already implemented, the Merger Agreement or any of the terms therein, costs and disbursements, and attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees and costs, as well as other equitable relief as the court deems proper.\nOne of the conditions to the Merger is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other order (as defined in the Merger Agreement) issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; nor shall there be any statute, rule, regulation, or order enacted, entered, or enforced that prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger. Consequently, if the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying, or otherwise adversely affecting the defendants\u2019 ability to consummate the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all. If consummation of the Merger is prevented or delayed, it could result in substantial costs to TTM and Viasystems. In addition, TTM and Viasystems could incur significant costs in connection with the Lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of Viasystems\u2019 directors and officers. For additional information, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nTTM\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger.\nParties with which TTM does business may experience uncertainty associated with the proposed Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with TTM or the combined company. TTM\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than TTM or the combined company. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, or results of operations of the combined company, including a material adverse effect on TTM\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in consummating the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nWe may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings or may incur additional costs.\nWe have identified at least $55 million in annualized cost savings, which are expected to be implemented within the first 12 months following consummation of the Merger. Approximately 40% of the identified cost savings relate to selling, general, and administrative labor related efficiencies, including rationalizing overlapping functional areas; approximately 36% of the identified cost savings relate to non-labor selling, general, and administrative costs, including service provider contract rationalization with the goal of increasing overhead efficiencies and avoiding duplicative efforts; and approximately 24% of the identified cost savings relates to plant operating efficiencies. Our estimates of costs to achieve these cost savings do not include non-cash restructuring costs relating to potential plant optimizations or any write-downs of long-lived assets or intangible assets, as we have not conducted our review of the operations of the combined company, and any such non-cash amounts may be material. To realize the anticipated cost savings, we expect to incur cash expenses of approximately $26 million in 2015, including approximately $9.9 million in change-in-control related payments noted below.\nIn addition, we expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies. Most of these non-recurring costs will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the Merger, including fees paid to financial and legal advisors related to the Merger and related\nfinancing arrangements, and employment-related costs. We expect to incur total merger-related costs of approximately $27.8 million, of which $6.0 million has been incurred during the year ended December 29, 2014 and consists primarily of investment bank fees, legal fees, and other professional fees, approximately $76.4 million in premiums, accrued interest, and other costs to refinance the debt of Viasystems, and approximately $33.3 million of debt issuance costs. In addition, pursuant to change-in-control provisions in Viasystems\u2019 employment agreements with certain executives, such executives may be entitled to receive change-in-control related payments in an amount equal to approximately $9.9 million upon a termination of employment.\nWhile our management believes these cost savings are achievable, our ability to achieve such estimated cost savings in the timeframe described is subject to various assumptions by management, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in our operations that offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize all of these cost savings within the time frame expected or at all. In addition, TTM may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings. See \u201c- The integration of Viasystems may present significant challenges to TTM, and although TTM expects the Merger with Viasystems will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits to TTM, TTM may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the realization of synergies, and other challenges.\u201d\nThe integration of Viasystems may present significant challenges to TTM, and although TTM expects the Merger with Viasystems will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits to TTM, TTM may not realize those benefits because of difficulties related to integration, the realization of synergies, and other challenges.\nTTM and Viasystems have operated and, until consummation of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key TTM or Viasystems employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or other unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues and potential risks, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of Viasystems and TTM in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger so the combined company performs as expected:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement the business plan for the combined company;\n\u2022\ncombining the businesses of TTM and Viasystems and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings or revenue synergies anticipated to result from the Merger, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nsatisfying the requirements of our customers and meeting their expectations while we integrate operations, transition production and reduce footprint;\n\u2022\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and other policies, procedures, and processes;\n\u2022\ncosts, including legal and settlement costs, associated with TTM\u2019s and Viasystems\u2019 legal proceedings, and other costs, including legal and settlement costs, associated with the combined company\u2019s other loss contingencies, in each case whether known or unknown and whether relating to past, present or future facts, events, circumstances, or occurrences, any of which could be materially adverse to the business, results of operations, assets, or financial condition of TTM or Viasystems and, following the Merger, the financial position, results of operations, and liquidity of the combined company and the ability of the combined company to achieve expected benefits of the Merger;\n\u2022\npotential deterioration in the financial performance of TTM and Viasystems, including any potential deviation in results of operations from historical levels;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in the size of our company after the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of divestiture requirements or a required exit from business lines to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and risks in the integration of departments and systems (including accounting, health information and management information systems), technologies (including software), books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls (including internal control over financial reporting and related procedures and policies); and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated issues, expenses, or liabilities that could materially adversely affect our ability to realize any expected synergies on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf we cannot successfully integrate Viasystems, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Successful integration of TTM and Viasystems will depend on our ability to manage these operations, to realize opportunities for revenue growth and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. Because of difficulties in combining the two companies, we may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Merger.\nThe Merger may be consummated on different terms from those contained in the Merger Agreement.\nPrior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties may, by their mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the Merger Consideration to be received by Viasystems stockholders, assets to be acquired, or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties\u2019 respective operations during the pendency thereof, except that no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by law or in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market, requires further approval by Viasystems\u2019 stockholders. Any such amendments or alterations may have negative consequences, including reducing the cash available for TTM\u2019s operations or to meet obligations or restricting or limiting our assets or operations. Under certain circumstances, Viasystems stockholders may be permitted or required to adopt any such amendments, which could delay the consummation of the Merger and subject us to additional expense.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to antitrust and other regulatory approvals, and any delay in the consummation of the Merger may substantially reduce the benefits that TTM expects to obtain from the Merger.\nSatisfying the conditions to, and consummation of, the Merger may take longer than, and could cost more than, TTM expects. TTM cannot predict whether or when the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied, and satisfying the conditions to the Merger, including obtaining antitrust, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and other regulatory approvals, could delay the effective time of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in consummating the Merger or any additional conditions imposed in order to consummate the Merger, including divestitures required to obtain the approvals of antitrust authorities, may not only materially adversely affect the cost savings and other benefits that TTM expects to achieve if the Merger and the integration of the companies\u2019 respective businesses are completed within the expected timeframe, but also may result in the sale of business lines that generate certain of our net sales, operating income and cash flows.\nEfforts may be made by regulatory authorities or private parties to rescind the Merger, place restrictions on the business of the combined company, or require divestitures to gain the approval of regulatory authorities with respect to the Merger.\nThe consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d) waiting period and the receipt of certain other approvals, including foreign approvals under the applicable antitrust and competition laws of China,\nGermany and Estonia. As of the date of this report, we have received the required antitrust approvals under the applicable antitrust and competition laws of China, Germany and Estonia. We have not yet received the necessary approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Additionally, we received a second request for additional information and documentary material (the \u201cSecond Request\u201d) from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) on December 4, 2014, which extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after we have substantially complied with the FTC\u2019s Second Request, unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by us or terminated earlier by the FTC. We intend to cooperate fully with the FTC in complying with the Second Request.\nNotwithstanding the expiration of the statutory waiting periods or an extension thereto and receipt of clearance of the Merger from the applicable regulatory authorities, at any time after consummation of the Merger the FTC, or any state or foreign regulatory authority, could take action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to rescind the Merger or the divestiture of shares purchased or particular assets held by the combined company, in addition to other restrictions. Moreover, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging the Merger after it has been consummated. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds after the consummation of the Merger will not be made or, if this challenge is made, what the result will be.\nIf the challenging party is successful, the Merger may be rescinded or we may be subject to requirements, limitations or costs, required to make divestitures or have restrictions placed on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. If we agree to any material requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect our ability to integrate Viasystems\u2019 operations with TTM\u2019s operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger. This could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, while the Merger is conditioned on the satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements, it is not conditioned on the absence of any changes to the business of TTM, Viasystems, and the combined company that may be necessitated by such regulatory authorities to obtain approvals.\nAs a result of the Merger, TTM\u2019s goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets in its consolidated balance sheet will increase. If its goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, TTM would be required to record a material, non-cash charge to earnings, which would also reduce its stockholders\u2019 equity.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable) and other intangible assets are similarly reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If TTM\u2019s goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, TTM will be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, and any such charges may be material. In the past, TTM has experienced impairments of goodwill, definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets due to weaker than expected operating results or changes in market conditions that were different than those anticipated and impacted the fair value of such assets. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Combined Company following the Merger\nFailure to achieve expected benefits of the Merger and to integrate Viasystems\u2019 operations with TTM\u2019s could materially adversely affect us following the completion of the Merger.\nAlthough we expect to realize strategic, operational, and financial benefits as a result of the Merger, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, such benefits will be achieved in the future. In particular, the success of the Merger will depend on achieving efficiencies and cost savings, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so. For example, costs associated with Viasystems\u2019 legal proceedings and other loss contingencies may be greater than expected. In addition, in order to obtain the benefits of the Merger, we must integrate Viasystems\u2019 operations. Such integration may be complex and the failure to do so quickly and effectively may negatively affect earnings.\nTTM may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel, and the loss of any of TTM\u2019s key executive officers could adversely affect TTM.\nTTM believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated, and qualified managerial and professional personnel, including, following the Merger, key employees of Viasystems. Key employees of TTM or Viasystems may depart for a variety of reasons, including because of issues relating to the difficulty of integration or accelerated retirement as a result of amounts received in connection with the Merger. If key employees of TTM or Viasystems depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined company\u2019s business following the Merger may be harmed. Furthermore, TTM may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of TTM or Viasystems, and TTM\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into TTM. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that TTM will be able to attract or retain key employees of TTM and Viasystems to the same extent that those companies have been able to attract or retain their own employees in the past.\nThe combined company may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to it on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nAfter consummation of the Merger, we will require liquidity to fund our operations and make capital expenditures, as well as interest and principal payments on our debt. To the extent that the funds generated by the combined company\u2019s ongoing operations are insufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings. If the combined company cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, its business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Any future equity or debt financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to the combined company, if at all.\nAfter the consummation of the Merger, the combined company will rely on the automotive industry for a significant portion of sales.\nA significant portion of Viasystems\u2019 historical sales has been to customers within the automotive industry. If there was a destabilization of the automotive industry or a market shift away from automotive customers, there may be a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAfter the consummation of the Merger, failure to meet the quality control standards of automotive customers may cause us to lose existing, or prevent us from gaining new, automotive customers.\nAfter the consummation of the Merger, we expect to serve numerous automotive customers. For safety reasons, automotive customers have strict quality standards that generally exceed the quality requirements of other customers. After the consummation of the Merger, a significant portion of our PCB products are expected to be sold to customers in the automotive industry, and if such products do not meet these quality standards, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These automotive customers may require long periods of time to evaluate whether the combined company\u2019s manufacturing processes and facilities meet their quality standards. If we were to lose automotive customers due to quality control issues, we might not be able to regain those customers or gain new automotive customers for long periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required under our contracts with automotive industry customers to indemnify them for the cost of warranties and recalls relating to our products. See \u201c- Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects, which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us.\u201d", "PERMNO": 88648, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "TTMI"}
