You should carefully read all of the information included in this report and carefully consider, among other matters, the following risk factors, as well as any discussed under Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, in which case, the market price of our securities could decline. The following is a summary of our principal Risk Factors.\nRisks Factor Summary\nRisks related to our business and industry\n\u2022Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\u2022Cyclical nature of our business\n\u2022We may be unable to implement our business strategies\n\u2022There may be overcapacity in the graphite electrode market\n\u2022Pricing for graphite electrodes is cyclical\n\u2022Our business is sensitive to economic conditions\n\u2022We are dependent on the EAF steel industry\n\u2022We operate in a competitive industry\n\u2022Our products are dependent on needle coke supply, raw materials and energy\n\u2022Our operations are subject to hazards\n\u2022We are subject to a variety of legal, economic, social and political risks\n\u2022We could be subject to manufacturing disruptions\n\u2022Plant improvements may be delayed or not achieve expected benefits\n\u2022We depend on third parties\n\u2022We may be subject to information technology failures\n\u2022We may not be able to recruit or retain personnel\n\u2022Some locations are subject to union negotiations\n\u2022We could potentially divest or acquire businesses\n\u2022We have significant goodwill\n\u2022We depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property\nRisks related to our indebtedness\n\u2022Our indebtedness could limit our financial and operating activities\n\u2022We are subject to covenants related to our 2018 Credit Agreement and 2020 Senior Notes\n\u2022Our cash flows may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness\nRisks related to tax matters\n\u2022Changes to our jurisdictional mix of income could impact us\n\u2022We are required to make payments under our Tax Receivable Agreement\nRisks related to government agencies\n\u2022Health, safety and environmental regulations could impact us\n\u2022We are subject to global data and privacy protection laws\nRisks related to our common stock\n\u2022Our ownership is concentrated\n\u2022Certain of our investors have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses\n\u2022We may not pay cash dividends on our common stock\n\u2022We are subject to provisions that could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control\n\u2022Future offerings could be affected by our stock price\n\u2022Our stock price could be negatively affected by large sales of our stock\nRisks related to our business and industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets and economy both globally and in the United States. In response to the pandemic and related mitigation measures, we began implementing changes in our business in February 2020 to protect our employees and customers, and to support appropriate health and safety protocols, which included: (i) canceling travel and eliminating in-person meetings, (ii) working from home where possible, and (iii) establishing a \u201cSafe-Work Playbook\u201d for our sites. Our plant procedures include temperature measurements where permitted, personal protective equipment, mandatory use of gloves, social distancing, frequent cleaning and disinfecting and the use of daily check sheets to keep team members highly focused on these new procedures. As the pandemic continues, we continue to limit travel and have certain employees working from home on rotations so that all employees are not in our offices at the same time. While all of these measures have been necessary and appropriate, they have resulted in additional costs and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance.\nWhile the outbreak had begun to subside in certain areas of the world where we operate and serve our customers, the infection rates in some of these areas have experienced a resurgence in the spread of COVID-19 and the infection rates in other areas continue to escalate. As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. The pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such effects may be material and the potential impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022adverse impacts on our customers, and resultant impacts on demand for our products;\n\u2022disruptions at our facilities, including reductions in operating hours, labor shortages and changes in operating procedures, including additional cleaning and disinfecting procedures;\n\u2022disruptions in our supply chain due to transportation delays, travel restrictions, raw material cost increases and shortages, and closures of businesses or facilities;\n\u2022reductions in our operating effectiveness due to workforce disruptions from COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing resulting from, among other things, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, and the unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; and\n\u2022volatility in the global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and additional sources of financing in the future.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our customers, employees, suppliers and distributors, and any adverse impacts on these parties may have a material adverse impact on our business. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Annual Report, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not currently aware of.\nOur business is cyclical and the selling prices of our products may lead to periods of reduced profitability and net losses in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of significant net losses. Our ability to maintain profitability depends on a number of factors, including the growth rate of the graphite electrode industry, the price of our products, the cost to produce our products, the competitiveness of our products and the production capacity at our existing plants. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this Annual Report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events.\nWe may be unable to implement our business strategies, including our initiative to secure and maintain long-term take-or-pay customer contracts, in an effective manner.\nOur future financial performance and success largely depend on our ability to successfully implement our business strategies for growth. We have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, various business strategies to sell a majority of our production capacity through long-term take-or-pay contracts, and improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We\ncannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategies or that implementing these strategies will sustain or improve and not harm our results of operations. In particular, our ability to successfully implement our strategy to enter into and maintain long-term take-or-pay contracts is subject to certain risks, including customers seeking to renegotiate key terms of their contracts, such as pricing and specified volume commitments, in the event market conditions change during the contract term; our inability to extend contracts when they expire; and a disruption in our access to Seadrift-produced petroleum needle coke, which we will rely on, in part, to deliver the contracted volumes under our long-term contracts. Under market conditions where the price of graphite electrodes is trending downwards, it may be unlikely that customers will commit to long-term take-or-pay contracts. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement this strategy or realize the anticipated benefits of these contracts. Recently, because of current market conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain customers with long-term contracts have struggled to take their committed volumes, which has resulted in some non-performance and disputes, including a few arbitrations, and we have modified some long-term contracts. In addition, the costs involved in implementing our strategies may be significantly greater than we currently anticipate.\nOur business strategies are based on our assumptions about future demand for our products and on our continuing ability to produce our products profitably. Each of these factors depends, among other things, on our ability to finance our operations, maintain high-quality and efficient manufacturing operations, effectively manage our customer relationships while enforcing customer commitments, respond to competitive and regulatory changes, access quality raw materials in a cost-effective and timely manner and retain and attract highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel. Any failure to develop, revise or implement our business strategies in a timely and effective manner may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGlobal graphite electrode overcapacity has adversely affected graphite electrode prices in the past, and may adversely affect them again, which could negatively impact our sales, margins and profitability.\nOvercapacity in the graphite electrode industry has adversely affected pricing in the past and may do so again. The rapid growth of Chinese steel production after 2010, which was primarily produced from BOF steelmaking, created a significant global oversupply of steel. Chinese steel exports gained market share from EAF steel producers, creating graphite electrode industry oversupply and inventory de-stocking in this period. Although Chinese steel exports have decreased since 2016, any significant future growth in Chinese steel exports could once again lead to an oversupply of steel, which would adversely affect the price of graphite electrodes.\nAn increase in global graphite electrode production capacity that outpaces an increase in demand for graphite electrodes could adversely affect the price of graphite electrodes. We believe worldwide graphite electrode supply will increase in 2021 as a result of Chinese capacity additions. While growth in the Chinese EAF steel market may support some of these capacity additions, the additional graphite electrode capacity may exceed local Chinese requirements. Excess production capacity may result in manufacturers producing and exporting electrodes at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices, and sometimes at or below their cost of production. Excessive imports into the Americas and EMEA, which markets collectively make up 90% of our net sales, can also exert downward pressure on graphite electrode prices, which negatively affects our sales, margins and profitability.\nPricing for graphite electrodes has historically been cyclical and the price of graphite electrodes may continue to decline in the future.\nPricing for graphite electrodes has historically been cyclical, reflecting the demand trends of the global EAF steelmaking industry and the supply of graphite electrodes. In addition, as petroleum needle coke reflects a significant percentage of the raw material cost of graphite electrodes, graphite electrodes have historically been priced at a spread to petroleum needle coke, which in the past has increased in tight demand markets. Historically, between 2008 and 2017, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes was approximately $4,800 per MT (on an inflation-adjusted basis using constant 2020 dollars).\nDuring the last demand trough in 2016, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes fell to approximately $2,500 per MT in 2016, on an inflation-adjusted basis using constant 2018 dollars. Following the significant rationalization of graphite electrode production globally, the resumption of growth in EAF steel production, falling scrap prices, reductions in Chinese steel exports and constrained supply of needle coke, graphite electrode prices reached record highs in 2018.\nCurrent prices have receded from the highs of 2018, and the price of graphite electrodes may continue to decline in the future. Supply and demand normalized in 2019, tipping towards overcapacity that exerts downward pressure on graphite electrode prices, and spot prices fell 25% during 2019. Spot prices decreased further in 2020. Current spot prices are below our weighted average contract price for long-term contracted volumes. Our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected to the extent prices for graphite electrodes decline in the future.\nOur business and operating results have been and will continue to be sensitive to economic conditions, and a downturn in economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and performance are materially affected by global and regional economic conditions. As described further below, we are dependent on the steel industry, which historically has been highly cyclical and is affected by general economic conditions. An economic downturn may reduce customer demand, reduce prices for our products or inhibit our ability to produce our products, which would negatively affect our operating results. Our business and operating results have also been and will continue to be sensitive to declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates and other challenges that can affect the economy. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing, leading them to delay or cancel plans to purchase our products or seek to renegotiate the terms of their supply contracts, and they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers and other business partners may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Also, it could be difficult to find replacements for business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases. These events would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the global steel industry generally and the EAF steel industry in particular, and a downturn in these industries may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe sell our products primarily to the EAF steel production industry. The steel industry historically has been highly cyclical and is affected significantly by general economic conditions. Significant customers for the steel industry include companies in the automotive, construction, appliance, machinery, equipment and transportation industries, which are industries that were negatively affected by the general economic downturn and the deterioration in financial markets, including severely restricted liquidity and credit availability, in the recent past. In particular, EAF steel production declined approximately 17% from 2008 to 2009 as a result of that general economic downturn and deterioration in financial markets. In addition, EAF steel production declined approximately 10% from 2011 to 2015 due to global steel production overcapacity driven largely by Chinese BOF steel exports.\nOur customers, including major steel producers, have in the past experienced and may again experience downturns or financial distress that could adversely impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis or at all.\nThe graphite industry is highly competitive. Our market share, net sales or net income could decline due to vigorous price and other competition.\nCompetition in the graphite industry (other than, generally, with respect to new products) is based primarily on price, product differentiation and quality, delivery reliability and customer service. Graphite electrodes, in particular, are subject to rigorous price competition. Competition with respect to new products is, and is expected to continue to be, based primarily on price, performance and cost effectiveness, customer service and product innovation. Competition could prevent implementation of price increases, require price reductions or require increased spending on R&D, marketing and sales that could adversely affect us. In such a competitive market, changes in market conditions, including customer demand and technological development, could adversely affect our competitiveness, sales and/or profitability.\nWe are dependent on the supply of petroleum needle coke. Our results of operations could deteriorate if recent disruptions in the supply of petroleum needle coke continue or worsen for an extended period.\nPetroleum needle coke is our key raw material used in the production of graphite electrodes. Seadrift currently provides the majority of our current petroleum needle coke requirements, and we purchase the remainder from external sources. We plan to rely on Seadrift-produced petroleum needle coke to support the production of substantially all of the contracted volumes of graphite electrodes under our long-term take-or-pay contracts. As a result, a disruption in Seadrift\u2019s production of petroleum needle coke could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of these contracts if we are forced to purchase petroleum needle coke from external sources at a higher cost to support the production of these contracted volumes. If a market shortage of petroleum needle coke occurs, we may be unable to acquire sufficient amounts of petroleum needle coke from external sources to support our remaining needle coke requirements currently used in the production of graphite electrodes for sale in the spot market. As a result, a disruption in the supply of petroleum needle coke could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on supplies of raw materials (in addition to petroleum needle coke) and energy. Our results of operations could deteriorate if those supplies increase in cost or are substantially disrupted for an extended period.\nWe purchase raw materials and energy from a variety of sources. In many cases, we purchase them under short-term contracts or on the spot market, in each case at fluctuating prices. The availability and price of raw materials and energy may be subject to curtailment or change due to:\n\u2022limitations, which may be imposed under new legislation or regulation;\n\u2022suppliers\u2019 allocations to meet demand from other purchasers during periods of shortage (or, in the case of energy suppliers, extended hot or cold weather);\n\u2022interruptions or cessations in production by suppliers; and\n\u2022market and other events and conditions.\nPetroleum and coal products, including decant oil and coal tar pitch, which are our principal raw materials other than petroleum needle coke, and energy, particularly natural gas, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. For example, Seadrift may not always be able to obtain an adequate quantity of suitable low-sulfur decant oil for the manufacture of petroleum needle coke, and capital may not be available to install equipment to allow use of higher sulfur decant oil (which is more readily available in the United States) if supplies of low-sulfur decant oil become more limited in the future. Further, recent low-sulfur emissions regulations adopted by the International Maritime Organization may adversely impact pricing for low-sulfur decant oil.\nWe have in the past entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, derivative contracts and short-duration fixed-rate purchase contracts to effectively fix a portion of our exposure to certain products. These hedging strategies may not be available or successful in eliminating our exposure. A substantial increase in raw material or energy prices that cannot be mitigated or passed on to customers or a continued interruption in supply, particularly in the supply of decant oil or energy, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These hedges may be insufficient or ineffective in protecting against the impact of these fluctuations.\nOur operations are subject to hazards which could result in significant liability to us.\nOur operations are subject to hazards associated with manufacturing and the related use, storage, transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather (including but not limited to hurricanes or other adverse weather that may be increasing as a result of climate change) and natural disasters, industrial accidents, mechanical failures, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, transportation interruptions, human error and terrorist activities. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and damage awards. While we believe our insurance policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. Costs associated with unanticipated events in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position or our ongoing results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal, economic, social and political risks associated with our substantial operations in multiple countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial and business operations.\nA substantial majority of our net sales are derived from sales outside the United States, and a majority of our operations and our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are located outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in multiple countries, including:\n\u2022currency fluctuations and devaluations in currency exchange rates, including impacts of transactions in various currencies, translation of various currencies into dollars for U.S. reporting and financial covenant compliance purposes, and impacts on results of operations due to the fact that the costs of our non-U.S. operations are primarily incurred in local currencies while their products are primarily sold in dollars and euros;\n\u2022imposition of or increase in customs duties and other tariffs;\n\u2022imposition of or increases in currency exchange controls, including imposition of or increases in limitations on conversion of various currencies into dollars, euros, or other currencies, making of intercompany loans by subsidiaries or remittance of dividends, interest or principal payments or other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022imposition of or increases in revenue, income or earnings taxes and withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022inflation, deflation and stagflation in any country in which we have a manufacturing facility;\n\u2022imposition of or increases in investment or trade restrictions by the United States or other jurisdictions or trade sanctions adopted by the United States;\n\u2022compliance with laws on anti-corruption, export controls, customs, sanctions and other laws governing our operations, including in challenging jurisdictions;\n\u2022inability to determine or satisfy legal requirements, effectively enforce contract or legal rights, including our rights under our long-term take-or-pay contracts and intellectual property rights, and obtain complete financial or other information under local legal, judicial, regulatory, disclosure and other systems; and\n\u2022nationalization or expropriation of assets, and other risks that could result from a change in government or government policy, or from other political, social or economic instability.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we may not be able to mitigate these effects.\nOur results of operations could deteriorate if our manufacturing operations were substantially disrupted for an extended period for any reason, including equipment failure, climate change, natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to disruption due to equipment failure, extreme weather conditions, floods, hurricanes and tropical storms and similar events, major industrial accidents, including fires or explosions, cybersecurity attacks, strikes and lockouts, adoption of new laws or regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in governmental enforcement policies, civil disruption, riots, terrorist attacks, war, public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events. These events may also impact the operations of one or more of our suppliers. For example, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are uncertain and will likely be particular to the geographic circumstances. These physical impacts may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, and changing global average temperatures. For instance, our Seadrift facility in Texas and our Calais facility in France are located in geographic areas less than 50 feet above sea level. As a result, any future rising sea levels could have an adverse impact on their operations and on their suppliers. In the event manufacturing operations are substantially disrupted at one of our primary operating facilities, we will not have the ability to increase production at our remaining operating facilities in order to compensate. To the extent any of these events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nPlant operational improvements may be delayed or may not achieve the expected benefits.\nOur ability to complete future operational improvements, including the shift of graphitization and machining of additional volume of semi-finished product from Monterrey to St. Marys, may be delayed, interrupted or otherwise limited by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, unexpected cost increases, availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the costs of these activities could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, these operational improvements may not achieve the expected benefits as a result of changes in market conditions, raw material shortages or other unforeseen contingencies.\nWe depend on third parties for certain construction, maintenance, engineering, transportation, warehousing and logistics services.\nWe contract with third parties for certain services relating to the design, construction and maintenance of various components of our production facilities and other systems. If these third parties fail to comply with their obligations, the facilities may not operate as intended, which may result in delays in the production of our products and materially adversely affect our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements or we may be required to recognize impairment charges. In addition, production delays could cause us to miss deliveries and breach our contracts, which could damage our relationships with our customers and subject us to claims for damages under our contracts. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe also rely primarily on third parties for the transportation of the products we manufacture. In particular, a significant portion of the goods we manufacture are transported to different countries, which requires sophisticated warehousing, logistics and other resources. If any of the third parties that we use to transport products are unable to deliver the goods we manufacture in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell these products at full value or at all, which could cause us to miss deliveries and breach our contracts, which could damage our relationships with our customers and subject us to claims\nfor damages under our contracts. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to information technology systems failures, cybersecurity attacks, network disruptions and breaches of data security, which could compromise our information and expose us to liability.\nOur information technology systems are an important element for effectively operating our business. Information technology systems or processes, and the information technology systems or processes of our customers, our third-party service providers, our vendors or other parties that have been entrusted with our information, including risks associated with any failure to maintain or upgrade our systems, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information or our financial reporting, leading to increased costs. It is possible that future technological developments could adversely affect the functionality of our computer systems and require further action and substantial funds to prevent or repair computer malfunctions. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybercrimes, internal or external security breaches, events such as fires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes, or errors by our employees. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security, back-up systems and internal control measures, these steps may be insufficient or ineffective. Security and/or privacy breaches, acts of vandalism or terror, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming, and/or human error or other similar events with respect to our information technology systems or processes or the information technology systems or processes of third-parties that have been entrusted with our information expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to recruit or retain key management and plant operating personnel.\nOur success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our key management and plant operating personnel. The loss of any member of our reorganized key management team and personnel or an inability to attract, retain, develop and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy. In addition, our future growth and success also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical personnel. The loss of one or more members of our key management or plant operating personnel, or the failure to attract, retain and develop additional key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully negotiate with the representatives of our employees, including labor unions, we may experience strikes and work stoppages.\nWe are party to collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements with our employees. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 697 employees, or 54%, of our worldwide employees, were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements all of which were covered by agreements that expire, or are subject to renegotiation, at various times through December 31, 2021. Although we believe that, in general, our relationships with our employees are good, we cannot predict the outcome of current and future negotiations and consultations with employee representatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not succeed in renewing or extending these agreements on terms satisfactory to us. Although we have not had any material work stoppages or strikes during the past decade, they may occur in the future during renewal or extension negotiations or otherwise. A material work stoppage, strike or other union dispute could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may divest or acquire businesses, which could require significant management attention or disrupt our business.\nWe may divest or acquire businesses to rationalize or expand our businesses and enhance our cash flows. Any acquisitions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022our inability to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during the integration process;\n\u2022becoming subject to contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct predating the acquisition that were not known to us at the time of the acquisition; and\n\u2022our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction, including the inability to achieve cost savings and synergies.\nAny divestitures may also involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of the affected business or business operations. Failure to timely complete or consummate an acquisition or a divestiture may negatively affect the valuation of the affected business or business operations or result in restructuring charges.\nWe have significant goodwill on our balance sheet that is sensitive to changes in the market, which could result in impairment charges.\nWe had approximately $171 million of goodwill on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist. Factors that could indicate that our goodwill is impaired include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. Impairment testing incorporates our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows. If we determine at a future time that impairment exists, it may result in a significant non-cash charge to earnings and lower stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur ability to grow and compete effectively depends on protecting our intellectual property. Failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our intellectual property, consisting primarily of patents and proprietary know-how and information, is important to our growth. Failure to protect our intellectual property may result in the loss of the exclusive right to use our technologies. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality and restricted-use agreements to protect our intellectual property. However, some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application or any such agreement. Intellectual property protection does not protect against technological obsolescence due to developments by others or changes in customer needs.\nPatents are subject to complex factual and legal considerations. Accordingly, the validity, scope and enforceability of any particular patent can be uncertain. Therefore, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022any of the U.S. or non-U.S. patents now or hereafter owned by us, or that third parties have licensed to us or may in the future license to us, will not be circumvented, challenged or invalidated;\n\u2022any of the U.S. or non-U.S. patents that third parties have non-exclusively licensed to us, or may non-exclusively license to us in the future, will not be licensed to others; or\n\u2022any of the patents for which we have applied or may in the future apply will be issued at all or with the breadth of claim coverage we seek.\nMoreover, patents, even if valid, only provide protection for a specified limited duration. In addition, effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may be limited or unavailable or we may not apply for it in the United States or in any of the other countries in which we operate.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights may be achieved, in part, by prosecuting claims against others who we believe have misappropriated our technology or have infringed upon our intellectual property rights, as well as by defending against misappropriation or infringement claims brought by others against us. Our involvement in litigation to protect or defend our rights in these areas could result in a significant expense to us, adversely affect the development of sales of the related products, and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that agreements designed to protect our proprietary know-how and information will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our strategic alliance suppliers and customers, consultants, employees or others will not assert rights against us with respect to intellectual property arising out of our relationships with them.\nThird parties may claim that our products or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings, including allegations and claims of alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot assure\nyou that the use of our patented technology or proprietary know-how or information does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, attempts to enforce our own intellectual property claims may subject us to counterclaims that our intellectual property rights are invalid, unenforceable or are licensed to the party against whom we are asserting the claim or that we are infringing that party\u2019s alleged intellectual property rights. We may also be obligated to indemnify affiliates or other partners who are accused of violating third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights by virtue of those affiliates or partners\u2019 agreements with us, and this could increase our costs in defending such claims and our damages.\nLegal proceedings involving intellectual property rights, regardless of merit, are highly uncertain and can involve complex legal and scientific analyses, can be time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and can significantly divert resources, even if resolved in our favor. Our failure to prevail in such matters could result in loss of intellectual property rights or judgments awarding substantial damages and injunctive or other equitable relief against us. If we were to be held liable or discover or be notified that our products or processes potentially infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we may face a loss of reputation and may not be able to exploit some or all of our intellectual property rights or technology. If necessary, we may seek licenses to intellectual property of others. However, we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to obtain a license from a third-party for that intellectual property necessary for the production or sale of any of our products could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and/or suspend the production or shipment of products or the use of processes requiring the use of that intellectual property. We may be required to substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid infringement.\nAny of the foregoing may require considerable effort and expense, result in substantial increases in operating costs, delay or inhibit sales or preclude us from effectively competing in the marketplace, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could limit our financial and operating activities and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our existing and future indebtedness.\nOur credit agreement (as amended, the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d) provides for (i) an aggregate $2,250 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201c2018 Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the 2018 Term Loan Facility, as amended, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,420 million of secured indebtedness outstanding including borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our 4.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2020 Senior Notes\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had $246.4 million available for borrowing under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (taking into account approximately $3.6 million of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder).\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $98.1 million and $127.3 million, respectively.\nOur substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022limit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022make us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nCompliance with our debt obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2020 Senior Notes could materially limit our financial or operating activities, or hinder our ability to adapt to changing industry conditions, which could result in our losing market share, a decline in our revenue or a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2020 Senior Notes include covenants that could restrict or limit our financial and business operations.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2020 Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022incur, repay or refinance indebtedness;\n\u2022create liens on or sell our assets;\n\u2022engage in certain fundamental corporate changes or changes to our business activities;\n\u2022make investments or engage in mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022pay dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022engage in certain affiliate transactions;\n\u2022enter into agreements or otherwise restrict our subsidiaries from making distributions or paying dividends to the borrowers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or to us or certain of our subsidiaries, as applicable; and\n\u2022repay intercompany indebtedness or make intercompany distributions or pay intercompany dividends.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants and contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a senior secured first lien net leverage ratio not greater than 4.00:1.00 when the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (except for undrawn letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to or less than $35 million), taken together, exceed 35% of the total amount of commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.\nThese covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants in the 2018 Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2020 Senior Notes, and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result, and the lenders and noteholders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable or, with respect to the 2018 Credit Agreement, refuse to lend additional amounts to us or require deposit of cash collateral in respect of outstanding letters of credit. If we were unable to repay or pay the amounts due, the lenders under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the noteholders could, among other things, proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our and our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets and certain assets of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nOur cash flows may not be sufficient to service our indebtedness, and if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, we may be required to seek other financing alternatives, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 2020 Senior Notes, depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations, which is subject to general economic conditions, competitive pressures and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to make these payments, we may be required to seek additional financing sources, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations or refinance our indebtedness. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to take any of these actions, and, even if successful, these actions may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance the debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2020 Senior Notes will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and the outstanding principal and interest on our debt\ncould be declared to be due and payable, in which case we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation or required to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or debt obligations.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned to our debt could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing and affect the market value of the 2020 Senior Notes. Additionally, we enter into various forms of hedging arrangements against currency, interest rate or decant oil price fluctuations. Financial strength and credit ratings are also important to the availability and pricing of these hedging activities, and a downgrade of our credit ratings may make it more costly for us to engage in these activities.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, which may occur at any time, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers and suppliers.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our businesses or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments, as well as our ability to effectively hedge our currency or interest rate risks and exposures, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These disruptions may also adversely impact the financial position of our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks related to tax matters\nSignificant changes in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws of those jurisdictions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results or operations and cash flows.\nOur future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of new tax legislation, other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets (arising, among other things, from tax loss carry forwards and our acquisition by Brookfield), changes to the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns, increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process R&D and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in available tax credits and additional tax or interest payments resulting from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from period to period. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could increase our tax rates and adversely impact our financial results in those periods.\nWe are required to make payments under a Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future, and the amounts we may pay could be significant.\nIn connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d) that provides Brookfield the right to receive future payments from us of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax and Swiss tax that we and our subsidiaries realize as a result of the utilization of certain tax assets attributable to periods prior to our IPO, including certain federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), previously taxed income under Section 959 of the Code, foreign tax credits, and certain NOLs in GrafTech Switzerland S.A. (collectively, the \u201cPre-IPO Tax Assets\u201d). In addition, we pay interest on the payments we make to Brookfield with respect to the amount of this cash savings from the due date (without extensions) of our tax return where we realize this savings to the payment date at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced on April 23, 2018 and will continue until there is no potential for any future tax benefit payments.\nWe made our initial payment of approximately $28 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement in February 2020. We expect that, based on current tax laws, future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the Pre-IPO Tax Assets will be approximately $40.9 million in the aggregate. The maximum amount over the term of the agreement is approximately $100 million. This figure does not account for our Pre-IPO Tax Assets attributable to previously taxed income under Section 959 of the Code, the value of which is highly speculative, and certain NOLs in GrafTech Switzerland S.A., which had a nominal value at the time of the IPO. Payments made by us to Brookfield under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. For more information about the Tax Receivable Agreement, see \u201cResults of operations-Critical accounting policies-Related Party Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nRisks related to government regulation\nStringent health, safety and environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing operations and facilities could result in substantial costs related to compliance, sanctions or material liabilities and may affect the availability of raw materials.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to our current and former properties (including former onsite landfills over which we have retained ownership), other properties that neighbor ours or to which we sent wastes for treatment or disposal, as well as our current raw materials, products, and operations. Some of our products (including our raw materials) are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of their component substances. Coal tar pitch, which is classified as a substance of very high concern under the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Regulation (\u201cREACH\u201d) regulations, is used in certain of our processes but in a manner that we believe does not currently require us to obtain a specific authorization under the REACH guidelines. Violations of these laws and regulations, or of the terms and conditions of permits required for our operations, can result in damage claims, reputational harm, the imposition of substantial fines and criminal sanctions and sometimes require the installation of costly pollution control or safety equipment or costly changes in operations to limit pollution or decrease the likelihood of injuries. In addition, we are currently conducting remediation and/or monitoring at certain current and former properties and may become subject to material liabilities in the future for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, including properties on which we have ceased operations. We have been in the past, and could be in the future, subject to claims alleging personal injury, death or property damage resulting from exposure to hazardous substances, accidents or otherwise for conditions creating an unsafe workplace. Further, alleged noncompliance with or stricter enforcement of, or changes in interpretations of, existing laws and regulations, adoption of more stringent new laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown contamination or imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities or reputational harm that have a material adverse impact on our operations, costs or results of operations. It is also possible that the impact of safety and environmental regulations on our suppliers could affect the availability and cost of our raw materials.\nFor example, legislators, regulators and others, as well as many companies, are considering ways to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) due to scientific, political and public concern that GHG emissions are altering the atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The EU has established GHG regulations and is revising its emission trading system for the period after 2020 in a manner that may require us to incur additional costs. The United States required reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources beginning in 2011. Further measures, in the EU and many other countries, may be enacted in the future. In particular, in December 2015, more than 190 countries participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCC\u201d) reached an international agreement related to curbing GHG emissions (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). Further GHG regulations under the Paris Agreement or otherwise may take the form of a national or international cap-and-trade emissions permit system, a carbon tax, emissions controls, reporting requirements, or other regulatory initiatives. For more information, see the section entitled \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nIt is possible that some form of regulation of GHG emissions will also be introduced in the future in other countries in which we operate or market our products. Regulation of GHG emissions could impose additional costs, both direct and indirect, on our business, and on the businesses of our customers and suppliers, such as increased energy and insurance rates, higher taxes, new environmental compliance program expenses, including capital improvements, environmental monitoring and the purchase of emission credits, and other administrative costs necessary to comply with current and potential future requirements or limitations that may be imposed, as well as other unforeseen or unknown costs. To the extent that similar requirements and limitations are not imposed globally, this regulation may impact our ability to compete with companies located in countries that do not have these requirements or limitations. We may also experience a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes in prices received for products sold and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for our products. The impact of any future GHG regulatory requirements on our global business will be dependent upon the design of the regulatory schemes that are ultimately adopted and, as a result, we are unable to predict their significance to our operations at this time.\nGlobal data and privacy protection laws applicable to us require substantial costs related to compliance, and any failure to comply could result in significant liability to us, including fines and penalties.\nWe collect data, including personally identifiable information of our employees, in the course of our business activities and transfer such data between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners and to third-party service providers, which may be subject to global data privacy laws and cross-border transfer restrictions. While we take steps to comply with these legal requirements, any changes to such laws may impact our ability to effectively transfer data across borders in support of our business operations and any breach of such laws may lead to administrative, civil or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to the Company and its employees. For example, the EU\u2019s GDPR, introduced a number of obligations for\nsubject companies, including obligations relating to data transfers and the security of personal data they process. We take steps to protect the security and integrity of the information we collect, but there is no guarantee that the steps we have taken will prevent inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of such information, or prevent third parties from gaining unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. Any such incident could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personally identifiable information (including the GDPR) and damage to our reputation.\nThe cost of ongoing compliance with global data protection and privacy laws and the potential fines and penalties levied in the event of a breach of such laws may have an adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, the GDPR currently provides that supervisory authorities in the EU may impose administrative fines for non-compliance of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or 4% of the subject company\u2019s annual, group-wide turnover (whichever is higher) and individuals who have suffered damage as a result of a subject company\u2019s non-compliance with the GDPR also have the right to seek compensation from such company. We will need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to compliance efforts with respect to global data protection and privacy laws, including the GDPR.\nRisks related to our common stock\nIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nAs of February 16, 2021, Brookfield owned approximately 47.8% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Brookfield has significant influence over all matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; the amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cAmended Certificate of Incorporation\u201d) and our Amended and Restated By-Laws (\u201cAmended By-Laws\u201d); and our winding up and dissolution. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of Brookfield may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control. Also, Brookfield may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but that might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.\nCertain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.\nBrookfield has other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of us. Brookfield has the right, and has no duty to abstain from exercising such right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us, do business with any of our clients, customers or vendors or employ or otherwise engage any of our officers, directors or employees. If Brookfield or any of its officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates.\nIn the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Brookfield acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person\u2019s capacity as our director or officer and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person\u2019s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us, if Brookfield pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if Brookfield does not present the corporate opportunity to us.\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently pay cash dividends on our common stock in accordance with our dividend policy. We cannot assure you, however, that we will pay dividends in the future in these amounts or at all. Our board of directors may change the timing and amount of any future dividend payments or eliminate the payment of future dividends in its sole discretion, without any prior notice to our stockholders. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon many factors, including our financial position and liquidity, results of operations, legal requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by the terms of our current and future credit facilities and other debt obligations and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. For example, we may or may not be able to, or may decide not to, pay dividends if we are unable, for any reason, to continue our long-term take-or-pay contracts strategy in the future or we experience a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations or our production of petroleum needle coke at Seadrift, that, in either case, inhibits our ability to deliver the contracted volumes under our three- to five-year take-or-pay contracts. In addition, adverse market conditions may lead us to prioritize repaying the principal on our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is also limited as a practical matter by our credit\nfacilities. In the future, we may also enter into other credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements or issue debt securities that, in each case, restrict or limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, since we are a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. Their ability to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See \u201cDividend Policies and Restrictions.\u201d\nCertain provisions, including in our Amended Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended By-Laws, could hinder, delay or prevent a change in control, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur Amended Certificate of Incorporation and Amended By-Laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors or Brookfield, including:\n\u2022provisions in our Amended Certificate of Incorporation and Amended By-Laws that prevent stockholders from calling special meetings of our stockholders, except where the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) confers the right to fix the date of such meetings upon stockholders;\n\u2022advance notice requirements by stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings;\n\u2022certain rights of Brookfield with respect to the designation of directors for nomination and election to our board of directors;\n\u2022no provision in our Amended Certificate of Incorporation or Amended By-Laws provides for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election;\n\u2022under our Amended Certificate of Incorporation, our board of directors have authority to cause the issuance of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms, preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock, all without approval of our stockholders; and\n\u2022nothing in our Amended Certificate of Incorporation precludes future issuances without stockholder approval of the authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions may make it difficult and expensive for a third-party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by Brookfield, our management or our board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in these types of transactions may not have an opportunity to do so, even if the transaction is favorable to stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or to change our management and board of directors and, as a result, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium.\nIn addition, in the event of certain changes in control, including if Brookfield\u2019s ownership of our outstanding common stock were to fall below 30%, payments to certain of our senior management may be triggered under certain of our compensation arrangements, which could have an adverse impact on us.\nOur Amended Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Amended Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, our Amended Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended By-Laws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our\ndirectors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our Amended Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;\n\u2022actions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022litigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n\u2022increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022general market, political and economic conditions, including any such conditions and local conditions in the markets in which our customers are located.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Future acquisitions could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance any future acquisitions through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, asset-backed acquisition financing and/or cash from operations.\nIssuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity\nsecurities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In particular, the sale in the public markets of our common stock by Brookfield, which, as of February 16, 2021, owned approximately 47.8% of our outstanding common stock, or by our officers and directors, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Brookfield may from time to time seek to sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of its shares, including by transferring shares to affiliates, distributing shares to its partners, members or beneficiaries, or selling shares in underwritten offerings, block sales, open market transactions or otherwise. Brookfield and our officers and directors may also sell shares into the public markets in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144, and Brookfield is entitled to request that we facilitate SEC registration of their sales of shares pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement. A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.\nThe future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nAs of February 16, 2021, we had an aggregate of 2,717,854,716 shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not otherwise reserved for issuance under our incentive plans. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We also intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may issue common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any common stock issued in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by public investors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 81925, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "EAF"}
