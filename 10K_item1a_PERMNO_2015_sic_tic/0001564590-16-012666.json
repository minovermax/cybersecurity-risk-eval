The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition by DSBJ\nOn February 4, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cDSBJ\u201d), and Dragon Electronix Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of DSBJ (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), under which Merger Sub will be merged with and into our company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with us continuing after the Merger as the surviving corporation and indirect subsidiary of DSBJ. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by our Board of Directors.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will receive $23.95 in cash for each share of common stock held at the close of the transaction.\nConsummation of the Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2016 and is subject to certain customary closing conditions including, among others, the absence of certain legal impediments; the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; antitrust regulatory approval in the People\u2019s Republic of China; review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; certain other filings and approvals by governmental authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China; and approval by our stockholders and DSBJ\u2019s stockholders.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and DSBJ. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay DSBJ a termination fee, or DSBJ may be required to pay us a reverse termination fee, depending on the circumstances under which the Merger Agreement is terminated. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, DSBJ has deposited $20.0 million of the aggregate Merger consideration into an escrow account with Citibank, N.A., and has agreed to make a further deposit of $7.45 million within 21 calendar days of the execution of the Merger Agreement, in order to secure the reverse termination fee that may become payable by DSBJ to us.\nWe will be required to pay a termination fee of 3.0% of the aggregate Merger consideration to DSBJ if the Merger Agreement is terminated because, among other things, we enter into an alternative definitive agreement in respect of a superior proposal, our Board of Directors changes its recommendation to stockholders with respect to the Merger, or our stockholders do not approve the Merger.\nDSBJ will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of $27.45 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated because, among other things, the DSBJ\u2019s shareholders do not approve the transaction, DSBJ fails to consummate the Merger after fulfilling its other closing conditions, or the Merger is not consummated solely because certain required regulatory approvals are not obtained within six months after the execution date of the Merger Agreement (which date may, in certain circumstances, be extended at DSBJ\u2019s discretion for an additional three months only if additional time is needed to obtain certain required regulatory approvals and DSBJ deposits an additional $10.0 million into the escrow account, increasing the reverse termination fee to $37.45 million).\nFor additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 4, 2016, including the full text of the Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to that Form 8-K.\nThe announcement and pendency of our proposed Merger with DSBJ could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition of our company by DSBJ could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations, regardless of whether the proposed Merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the proposed acquisition. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the transaction, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger as provided in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, sell, transfer or license our assets, amend our organizational documents, and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could result in our inability to\nrespond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nFailure to complete the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that the closing of the Merger will occur. Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among other things, the absence of certain legal impediments; the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; antitrust regulatory approval in the People\u2019s Republic of China; review and clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; certain other filings and approvals by governmental authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China; and approval by our stockholders and DSBJ\u2019s stockholders. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of these conditions will be satisfied. Although there is not a financing contingency in the Merger Agreement, the Merger could fail if DSBJ is unable to obtain the financing for the transaction, in which event we would likely be entitled to the reverse break-up fee. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by us to enter into an agreement for a \u201csuperior proposal.\u201d If the Merger is not consummated, our stock price will likely decline as our stock has recently traded based on the proposed per share price for the Merger. We will have incurred significant costs, including, among other things, the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the closing of the Merger does not occur. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe experienced a decline in revenue in each year from fiscal 2011 to 2014 , as well as incurred net losses in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, and we may incur net losses in future periods.\nFrom fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2014, we experienced a decline in revenue from $831.6 million in 2011, to $818.9 million in 2012, to $787.6 million in 2013, to $633.2 million in 2014, resulting from a decline in sales to certain of our key customers. We believe this resulted from decline of business from one of our key customers, which has been undergoing a business transition, as well as loss of market share from another key customer. Although we are undertaking efforts to diversify our customer base and increase our sales, including to new customers, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offsetting these losses with sales to other customers.\nIn addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, we incurred a net loss of $65.5 million and $84.5 million, respectively, on a full year basis. These losses, among other things, adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Although we have undergone strategic restructuring efforts and returned to profitability for the last six consecutive quarters, we cannot be certain that this return to profitability will be sustained, and our profitability may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, including capacity utilization, overhead absorption, yields and product mix.\nWe are, and have historically been, heavily dependent upon the smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics industries, and any downturn in these sectors may reduce our net sales.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended December 31, 2014 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, approximately 73%, 72%, 71% and 71%, respectively, of our net sales were derived from sales to companies for products or services into our smartphone sector; approximately 12%, 18%, 16% and 21%, respectively, of our net sales derived from sales were to companies for products or services into our tablet sector; and approximately 13%, 6%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of our net sales were derived from sales to companies for products or services into our consumer electronics sector, which includes wearables. In general, these sectors are subject to economic cycles, changes in customer order patterns and periods of slowdown. Intense competition, relatively short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand characterize these sectors, and these sectors are also generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence. Fluctuations in demand for our products as a result of periods of slowdown in these markets (including the current economic downturn) or discontinuation of products or modifications developed in connection with next generation products could reduce our net sales.\nWe depend on a very limited number of key customers, and a limited number of programs from those customers, for significant portions of our net sales and if we lose business with any of these customers or if the products we are in are not commercially successful, our net sales could decline substantially.\nFor the past several years, a substantial portion of our net sales has been derived from products that are incorporated into programs manufactured by or on behalf of a very limited number of key customers and their subcontractors, including Apple Inc. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended December 31, 2014 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, our net sales to our largest customer represented approximately 75%, 76%, 57% and 75%, respectively, of our net sales. In\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the three months ended December 31, 2014 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, our net sales to our second largest customer represented approximately 10%, 12%, 17% and 3%, respectively, of our net sales. In addition, a substantial portion of our sales to each customer is often tied to only one, or a small number of, programs. Our significant customer concentration increases the risk that our business terms with those customers may not be as favorable to us as those we might receive in a more competitive environment. The loss of a major customer or a significant reduction in sales to a major customer, including due to a penalty imposed by a customer, the loss of market share with the customers, the lack of commercial success by such customer or one or more of its products, a product failure of a customer\u2019s program or limited flex content in a program, would seriously harm our business. Although we are continuing our efforts to reduce dependence on a limited number of customers, we may not be successful in such efforts.\nWe will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design flexible printed circuits and assemblies into their product offerings or our customers\u2019 product offerings are not commercially successful.\nWe sell our flexible printed circuits and assemblies directly or indirectly to OEMs, who include our flexible circuits and component assemblies in their product offerings. We must continue to design our products into our customers\u2019 product offerings in order to remain competitive. However, our OEM customers may decide not to design flexible printed circuits into their product offerings (or may reduce the amount of flex in a product offering), or may procure flexible printed circuits from one of our competitors. If an OEM selects one of our competitors to provide a product instead of us or switches to alternative technologies developed or manufactured by one or more of our competitors, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that OEM because changing component providers after the initial production runs begin involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the OEM. Even if an OEM designs one of our products into its product offering, the product may not be commercially successful or may experience product failures, we may not receive any orders from that manufacturer, the OEM may qualify additional vendors for the product or we could be undercut by a competitor\u2019s pricing. Additionally, if an OEM selects one or more of our competitors, they may rely upon such competitors for the life of that specific offering and subsequent generations of similar offerings. Any of these events would result in fewer sales and reduced profits for us, and could adversely affect the accuracy of any forward-looking guidance we may give.\nChanges in the products our customers buy from us can significantly affect our capacity, net sales and profitability.\nWe sell our flexible printed circuits and assemblies to a very limited number of customers, who typically purchase these products from us for numerous programs at any particular time. Customer programs differ in design and material content and our products\u2019 prices and profitability are dependent on a wide variety of factors, including without limitation, expected volumes, assumed yields, material costs, actual yields and the amount of third-party components within the program. If we lose sales for a program that has higher material content, we may have to replace it with sales for a program that has lower material content, thus requiring additional capacity to generate the same amount of net sales. We may not have such capacity available, or it may not be economically advantageous to acquire such capacity, which could then result in lower net sales. Furthermore, if we were unable to increase our capacity to match our customers\u2019 requests, we may lose existing business from such customer, in addition to losing future sales. In addition, if we were to utilize our capacity to increase sales of bare flex (flex without assembly), this could also generate lower net sales at potentially different (higher or lower) profitability levels.\nOur customers often cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or qualify additional vendors, any of which can reduce our net sales, increase our expenses, affect our gross margin and/or cause us to write down inventory.\nSubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, and we are not always able to predict with certainty the number of orders we will receive or the timing or magnitude of the orders. Our customers may cancel, change or delay product purchase orders, or suspend business with us altogether, with little or no advance notice to us. These changes may be for a variety of reasons, including changes in their prospects, the perception of the quality of our products, cancellation of orders as a penalty a customer decides to impose on us, the competitiveness of our pricing, the success of their products in the market, reliance on a new vendor and the overall economic forecast. The risk of this is particularly high during the ramp phase of our customers\u2019 new programs, when their programs may not gain the traction they expected or they may decide to push out the timing on a program due to a variety of circumstances, including many that do not relate to us at all. In general, we do not have long-term contractual relationships with our customers that require them to order minimum quantities of our products, and our customers may decide to use another manufacturer or discontinue ordering from us in their discretion, potentially even after we have begun production on their program. In addition, many of our products are shipped to hubs, and we often have limited visibility and no control as to when our customers pull the inventory from the hub. We also have increased risks with respect to inventory control and potential inventory loss, and must rely on third parties for recordkeeping, when our products are shipped to a hub. In addition, whether products are pulled from our hub, or the hub of one of our competitors is not within our control, and the EMS companies who make such decisions may favor one of our competitors over us, particularly if such competitor is affiliated with the EMS company. As a result of these factors, we are not always able to forecast accurately the net sales that we will make in a given period, and our sales could drop precipitously at any time on little\nor no notice. Changes in orders can also result in layoffs and associated severance costs, which in any given financial period could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, we are increasingly being required to purchase materials, components and equipment before a customer becomes contractually committed to an order so that we may timely deliver the expected order to the customer. We may increase our production capacity, working capital and overhead in expectation of orders that may never be placed, or, if placed, may be delayed, reduced or canceled. As a result, we may be unable to recover costs that we incur in anticipation of orders that are never placed or are cancelled without liability after placed, such as costs associated with purchased raw materials, components or equipment. Delayed, reduced or canceled orders could also result in write-offs of obsolete inventory. Although we estimate inventory reserve amounts, the amount reserved may not be sufficient for such write-offs. In addition, we may underutilize our manufacturing capacity if we decline other orders because we expect to use our capacity for orders that are later delayed, reduced or canceled.\nOur industry is extremely competitive, and if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures we may lose sales and our market share could decline.\nWe compete primarily with large flexible printed circuit board manufacturers located throughout Asia, including Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan and Singapore. We believe that the number of companies producing flexible printed circuit boards has increased materially in recent years and may continue to increase. In addition, certain former competitors are in the process of re-instituting their flexible printed circuit production which will increase competition in our market. Certain EMS providers have developed or acquired their own flexible printed circuit manufacturing capabilities or have extensive experience in electronics assembly, and in the future may cease ordering products from us or even compete with us on OEM programs. In addition, the number of customers in the market has been decreasing through consolidation and otherwise and the smartphone and tablet markets continue to become more competitive in terms of pricing. Furthermore, many companies in our target customer base may move the design and manufacturing of their products to original design manufacturers in Asia. These factors, among others, make our industry extremely competitive. If we are not successful in addressing these competitive aspects of our business, we may not be able to grow or maintain our market share, net sales, or profitability.\nOur products and their terms of sale are subject to various pressures from our customers, competitors and market forces, any of which could harm our gross profits.\nOur selling prices are affected by changes in overall demand for our products, changes in the specific products our customers buy, pricing of competitors\u2019 products, our manufacturing efficiency, product life cycles and general economic conditions. In addition, from time to time we may elect to reduce the price of certain products we produce in order to gain additional orders, or not lose orders, on a particular program. A typical life cycle for one of our products has our selling price decrease as the program matures. To offset price decreases during a product\u2019s life cycle, we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yield and productivity to reduce a product\u2019s cost. If we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during a product\u2019s life cycle, or if we are required to pay damages to a customer due to a breach of contract or other claim, including due to quality or delivery issues, our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase, which would harm our profitability and could affect our working capital levels.\nIn addition, our key customers and their subcontractors are able to exert significant pricing pressure on us and often require us to renegotiate the terms of our arrangements with them, including increasing or removing liability and indemnification thresholds and increasing the length of payment terms, among other terms. Increases in our labor costs, especially in China where we may have little or no advance notice of such increases, changes in contract terms and regular price reductions have historically resulted in lower gross margins for us and may continue to do so in future periods. Furthermore, our competitive position is dependent upon the yields and quality we are able to achieve on our products and our level of automation as compared to our competitors. We believe our competitors have been rapidly investing in more efficient and higher capability processes and automation, and if we do not match such investments, this could negatively impact our ability to compete on price, technology and capability. These trends and factors may harm our business and make it more difficult to compete effectively, and grow or maintain our net sales and profitability.\nSignificant product failures or safety concerns about our or our customers\u2019 products could harm our reputation and our business.\nContinued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, quality control, material costs and successful product testing capabilities are critical to our growth. Our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement stringent testing and manufacturing processes for our products may not be sufficient. If any flaw in the design, production, assembly or testing of our or our customers\u2019 products were to occur or if our, or our customers\u2019, products were believed to be unsafe, it could result in significant delays in product shipments by, or cancellation of orders or substantial penalties from, our customers and their customers, substantial refund, recall, repair or replacement costs, an increased return rate for our products, potential damage to our reputation, or potential lawsuits which could prove to be time consuming and costly. Pronouncements by the World Health Organization listing mobile phone use as possibly carcinogenic may\naffect our customers\u2019 sales and in turn affect our sales to our customers. Because we normally provide a warranty for our products, a significant claim for damages related to a breach of warranty could materially affect our financial results.\nProblems with manufacturing yields and/or our inability to ramp up production could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nWe could experience low manufacturing yields due to, among other things, design errors, manufacturing failures in new or existing products, the inexperience of new employees, component defects, or the learning curve experienced during the initial and ramp up stages of new product introduction. If we cannot achieve expected yields in the manufacture of our products, this could result in higher operating costs, which could result in higher per unit costs, reduced product availability and may subject us to substantial penalties by our customers. Reduced yields or an inability to successfully ramp up products can significantly harm our gross margins, resulting in lower profitability or even losses. In addition, if we were unable to ramp up our production in order to meet customer demand, whether due to yield or other issues, it would impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products, which could cause us to lose an order for such product, or lose the customer altogether, and our net sales and profitability would be negatively affected.\nWe must invest in and develop or adopt new technology and update our manufacturing processes in order to remain an attractive supplier to our customers, and we may not be able to do so successfully.\nOur long-term strategy relies in part on timely adopting, developing and manufacturing technological advances and new processes to meet our customers\u2019 needs and to expand into new markets outside the mobility market. However, any new technology or process adopted or developed by us may not meet the expectations of our existing or potential customers, or customers outside the mobility market may not select either our current or new process capabilities for their offerings. Customers could decide to switch to alternative technologies or materials, adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are incompatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible. If we are unable to obtain customer qualifications for new processes or product features, cannot qualify our processes for high-volume production quantities or do not execute our operational and strategic plans for new developments in advanced technologies in a timely manner, our net sales or profitability may decrease. In addition, we may incur higher manufacturing costs in connection with new technology, materials, products or product features, as we may be required to replace, modify, design, build and install equipment, all of which would require additional capital expenditures. Also, due to financial constraints, we may not be able to invest in such new technology advancements and as a result, could fall behind our competition and/or not be able to satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements, which could result in loss of sales and decreased profitability.\nWe must continue to be able to procure raw materials and components on commercially reasonable terms to manufacture our products profitably.\nGenerally we do not maintain a large surplus stock of raw materials or components for our products because the specific assemblies are uniquely applicable to the products we produce for our customers; therefore, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide these raw materials and components in a timely fashion and on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, we are often required by our customers to seek components from a limited number of suppliers that have been pre-qualified by the customer. We, or our customers, may not be able to obtain the components or flex materials that are required for our customers\u2019 programs, which in turn could forestall, delay, or halt our production or our customers\u2019 programs. Delays may occur in future periods for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, natural disasters. Furthermore, the supply of certain precious metals required for our products is limited, and our suppliers could lose their export or import licenses on materials we require, any of which could limit or halt our ability to manufacture our products. We may not be successful in managing any shortage of raw materials or components that we may experience in the future, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and result in a decrease in our net sales or litigation by our customers against us. Component shortages could also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply. In addition, suppliers could go out of business, discontinue the supply of key materials, or consider us too small of a customer to sell to directly, and could require us to buy through distributors, increasing the cost of such components to us.\nOur manufacturing and shipping costs may also be impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas. Any fluctuations in the supply or prices of these commodities could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain personnel necessary to operate our business, our ability to develop and market our products successfully could be harmed.\nWe believe that our success is highly dependent on our current executive officers and management team. We do not have an employment contract with Reza Meshgin, our president and chief executive officer, or any of our other key personnel, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. The loss of any key employee or the inability to\nattract or retain qualified personnel, including engineers, sales and marketing personnel, management or finance personnel could delay the development and introduction of our products, harm our reputation or otherwise damage our business.\nFurthermore, we have experienced very high employee turnover in our facilities in China, and we continue to experience difficulty in recruiting employees for these facilities. In addition, we are noting the signs of wage inflation, labor unrest and increased unionization in China and new regulations regarding the usage of contract workers, and expect these to be ongoing trends for the foreseeable future, which could cause employee issues, including work stoppages, excessive wage increases and increased activity of labor unions, at our China facilities. A large number of our employees works in our facilities in China, and our costs associated with hiring and retaining these employees have increased over the past several years. The high turnover rate, increasing wages, new regulations regarding contract workers, our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and the other labor trends we are noting in China have resulted in an increase in our employee expenses, and a continuation of any of these trends could result in even higher costs or production disruptions or delays or the inability to ramp up production to meet increased customer orders, resulting in order cancellation, imposition of customer penalties if we were unable to timely deliver product or a negative impact on net sales and profits for us.\nOur reliance on outside service providers may negatively impact our operations, products and customer satisfaction.\nFrom time to time, we use the services of outside service vendors, or OSVs, for certain activities related to our business, including to provide manufacturing services within our facilities. Our reliance on these OSVs subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nour inability to have the same level of control over the employees of the OSVs who are providing manufacturing services for us as we would have over our own employees, which could affect the pre-employment screening, loss control, efficiency, work flow and quality of work of our operations; and\n\u25cf\nregulations regarding the use of OSVs in China could cause us to be forced to stop using, or limit the percentage of our workforce provided by, OSVs with little or no notice, which could negatively affect our ability to produce product for our customers.\nOur manufacturing capacity may be interrupted, limited or delayed if we cannot maintain sufficient utility sources in China.\nThe flexible printed circuit fabrication process requires a stable utility source. We have periodically experienced and expect to continue to experience insufficient supplies of electrical power from time to time, especially during the warmer summer months in China. In addition, China has instituted energy conservation regulations which ration the amount of electricity that may be used by enterprises such as ours. Although we have purchased a few generators and could lease additional generators, such generators do not produce sufficient electricity supply to run our manufacturing facilities and they are costly to operate. Power or steam interruptions, electricity shortages, the cost of diesel fuel to run our back-up generators or government intervention, particularly in the form of rationing, are factors that could restrict our access to electricity at our Chinese manufacturing facilities. Any such insufficient access to electricity, gas, steam or other utility could affect our ability to manufacture and related costs. Any such shortages could result in delays in our shipments to our customers and, potentially, the loss of customer orders and penalties from such customers for the delay.\nOur global operations expose us to additional risk and uncertainties.\nWe have operations in a number of countries, including the United States, China and Singapore. Our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to operate our business. We manufacture the bulk of our products in China and sell our products globally, which exposes us to a number of risks which can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations, including:\n\u25cf\npolitical unrest, terrorism and economic or financial instability;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and uncertainty related to developing legal and regulatory systems related to economic and business activities, real property ownership and application of contract rights;\n\u25cf\nnationalization programs that may be implemented by foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nimport-export regulations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including complying with local employment and overtime regulations, which regulations could affect our ability to quickly ramp production;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in ensuring that health, safety, environmental and other working conditions are properly implemented and/or maintained by the local office, the failure of which could require us to close our factories on little or no notice;\n\u25cf\nchanges in labor practices, including wage inflation, frequent and extremely high increases in the minimum wage, labor unrest and unionization policies;\n\u25cf\nlimited intellectual property protection;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles by international customers;\n\u25cf\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u25cf\ninadequate local infrastructure and disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages;\n\u25cf\ntransportation delays and difficulties in managing international distribution channels;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing foreign subsidiaries and in managing an expatriate workforce;\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues;\n\u25cf\nthe occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods or other acts of force majeure; and\n\u25cf\npublic health emergencies such as SARS, avian flu and swine flu.\nWe also face risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings as a result of our foreign operations. In some countries, economic, monetary and regulatory factors could affect our ability to convert funds to U.S. dollars or move funds from accounts in these countries. We are also vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Although we have significant operations in Asia, a substantial portion of transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, including approximately 90% of the total shipments made to foreign manufacturers during the fiscal year 2014. The remaining balance of our net sales is primarily denominated in Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). As a result, as appreciation against the U.S. dollar increases, it will result in an increase in the cost of our business expenses in China. Further, downward fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make our products less price competitive than local solutions. Although we have recently benefited from foreign exchange rates, unfavorable movements in the exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition. From time to time, we may engage in currency hedging activities, but such activities may not be able to limit the impact or risks of currency fluctuations.\nIn addition, our activities in China are subject to administrative review and approval by various national and local agencies of China\u2019s government. Given the changes occurring in China\u2019s legal and regulatory structure, we may not be able to secure required governmental approval for our activities or facilities, or the government may not apply real property or contract rights in the same manner as one may expect in other jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, we restructure our manufacturing capacity, and we may have difficulty managing these changes.\nFrom time to time, we engage in a number of manufacturing expansion and contraction projects, based on the then-current and forecasted needs of our business. In addition, from time to time, we engage in international restructuring efforts in order to better align our business functions with our international operations and transition to other lower cost locations in continuation of our cost reduction efforts.\nOur management team may have difficulty managing our manufacturing capacity and transition projects or otherwise managing any growth or downsizing in our business that we may experience. Risks associated with right-sizing our manufacturing capacity may include those related to:\n\u25cf\nmanaging multiple, concurrent capacity expansion or reduction projects;\n\u25cf\nmanaging the reduction of employee headcount for facilities where we reduce or cease our activities;\n\u25cf\naccurately predicting any increases or decreases in demand for our products and managing our manufacturing capacity appropriately;\n\u25cf\nunder-utilized capacity, particularly during the start-up phase of a new manufacturing facility and the effects on our gross margin of under-utilization;\n\u25cf\nmanaging increased employment costs and scrap rates often associated with periods of growth or contraction;\n\u25cf\nimplementing, integrating and improving operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including our computer systems;\n\u25cf\nconstruction delays, equipment delays or shortages, labor shortages and disputes and production start-up problems; and\n\u25cf\ncost overruns and charges related to our expansion or contraction of activities.\nOur management team may not be effective in restructuring our manufacturing facilities, and our systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support such changes in manufacturing capacity. Any inability to manage changes in our manufacturing capacity may harm our profitability and growth.\nUnited Engineers Limited is deemed to have an indirect beneficial ownership in approximately 61% of our outstanding common stock and is able to exert influence over us and our major corporate decisions.\nUnited Engineers Limited (\u201cUEL\u201d) through its subsidiaries (which include WBL Corporation Limited (\u201cWBL\u201d) as result of UEL\u2019s stock acquisition of WBL in 2013) (collectively the \u201cUE Group\u201d) is deemed to indirectly beneficially own approximately 61% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the UE Group has influence over the composition of our board of directors and our management, operations and potential significant corporate actions. The board or executive management composition of the UE Group could change, and such change could affect the strategic direction of the UE Group and the way the UE Group influences our corporate actions. For example, although we have put in place several measures designed to limit the amount of influence the UE Group has over us (including a staggered board of directors, not allowing action by written consent of our stockholders and not allowing stockholders to call a special meeting), for so long as the UE Group continues to control more than a majority of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to control who is elected to our board of directors each year, and ultimately can change out our entire board in three years. Furthermore, the strategic direction of the UE Group may influence how, when and if the WBL Entities (defined below) elect to sell its stock in us under the Registration Statement on Form S-3 that has been filed by the Company and declared effective by the SEC to cover such sales.\nIn addition, for so long as WBL or its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cWBL Entities\u201d) effectively own at least one-third of our voting stock, it has the ability, through a stockholders\u2019 agreement with us, to approve the appointment of any chief executive officer or the issuance of securities that would reduce the WBL Entities\u2019 effective ownership of us to a level that is below a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, as determined on a fully diluted basis. As a result, the WBL Entities could preclude us from engaging in an acquisition or other strategic opportunity that we may want to pursue if such acquisition or opportunity require the issuance of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could deprive our other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company, could harm the market price of our common stock and could impede the growth of our company. The UE Group could also sell a controlling interest in us, or a portion of their interest, to a third party, including a participant in our industry, which could adversely affect our operations or our stock price.\nThe UE Group and its representatives on our board of directors may have interests that conflict with, or are different from, the interests of our other stockholders. These conflicts of interest could include potential competitive business activities, corporate opportunities, indemnity arrangements, debt covenants, sales or distributions by the UE Group of our common stock and the exercise by the UE Group of its ability to influence our management and affairs. In general, our certificate of incorporation does not contain any provision that is designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest. If any conflict of interest is not resolved in a manner favorable to our stockholders, it could adversely affect our operations and our stockholders\u2019 interests may be substantially harmed.\nUEL may be unable to vote its shares in us on certain matters that require stockholder approval without obtaining approval from the stockholders of UEL and/or regulatory approval and it is possible that such stockholders or the relevant regulators may not approve the proposed corporate action.\nUEL\u2019s ordinary shares are listed on the Singapore Securities Exchange Trading Limited (the \u201cSingapore Exchange\u201d). Under the rules of the Singapore Exchange, when we submit a matter for the approval of our stockholders, UEL may be required to obtain the approval of its own respective stockholders for such action before UEL can vote its shares with respect to our proposal or dispose of our shares of common stock. Examples of corporate actions we may seek to take that may require UEL to obtain its stockholders\u2019 approval may include certain amendments of our certificate of incorporation, an acquisition or a sale of our assets the value of which exceeds certain prescribed thresholds under the rules of the Singapore Exchange, and certain issuances of our capital stock. In addition, we have been advised that if UEL is in an \u201coffer period\u201d under the rules of the Singapore Exchange (for example, if there was a potential offer by a third party for UEL\u2019s outstanding shares), then during the pendency of such offer period UEL may be prevented from doing anything that would constitute \u201cfrustration of the offer\u201d without first obtaining (a) either the approval of its stockholders or the potential offeror and (b) the Singapore Securities Industry Council (the \u201cSIC\u201d). Any material acquisition by, or\ndisposition of, one of UEL\u2019s subsidiaries, including us, could be considered a \u201cfrustration of the offer,\u201d and thus, approval by UEL\u2019s stockholders/potential offeror and the SIC could first be required for UEL.\nTo obtain stockholder approval, UEL must prepare a circular describing the proposal, submit it to the Singapore Exchange for review and send the circular to its stockholders, which may take several weeks or longer. In addition, UEL is required under its corporate rules to give its stockholders advance notice of the meeting. Consequently, if we need to obtain our stockholders\u2019 approval for a matter which also requires the approval of the stockholders of UEL, the process of seeking stockholder approval from UEL may delay our proposed action and it is possible that the stockholders of UEL may not approve our proposed corporate action. It is also possible that we might not be able to establish a quorum at our stockholder meeting if UEL is unable to vote at the meeting if the approval of the stockholders of UEL is not obtained. The rules of the Singapore Exchange that govern WBL and UEL are subject to revision from time to time, and policy considerations may affect rule interpretation and application. It is possible that any change to or interpretation of existing or future rules may be more restrictive and complex than the existing rules and interpretations.\nOur business requires significant investments in capital equipment, facilities and technological improvements, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to make such capital expenditures.\nTo remain competitive we must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment, facilities and technological improvements. We expect that substantial capital may be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital requirements in the future. In addition, we expect that new technology requirements may increase the capital intensity of our business. We may need to raise additional funds through further debt or equity financings in order to fund our anticipated growth and capital expenditures, and we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, particularly given our recent financial performance. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we may have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net sales, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business. Furthermore, our board has authorized a stock repurchase program, and may authorize additional stock repurchases in the future, and the funds we expend for any such repurchase may later be needed for the operation of our business.\nIn addition, under our stockholder agreement with the WBL Entities, approval from a \u201cWBL Director\u201d on our board (as defined in such agreement) is required for the issuance of securities that would reduce its effective ownership of us to below a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as determined on a fully diluted basis. If such approval is required for a proposed financing, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain the approval for the financing and we may not be able to complete the transaction, which could make it more difficult to obtain sufficient funds to operate and expand our business.\nWe are subject to covenants in our credit agreements and any failure to comply with such covenants could result in our being unable to borrow under the agreements and other negative consequences.\nOur credit agreements contain customary covenants. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any borrowing conditions or other covenants in our current or future credit agreements. Our failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be unable to borrow under the agreements and may constitute an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness then outstanding under that, or other, credit agreements, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. Due to our cash and cash equivalent position and the fact that we have no long-term borrowings currently outstanding under our lines, we do not currently anticipate that our failure to comply with any of the covenants under our credit lines would have a significant impact on our ability to meet our financial obligations in the near term. Termination of one of our credit lines because of a failure to comply with such covenants, however, would be a disclosable event and may be perceived negatively. Such perception could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nTax positions we have taken may be challenged and we are subject to the risk of changing income tax rates and laws.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various types of tax audits, during which tax positions we have taken may be challenged and overturned. If this were to occur, our tax rates could significantly increase and we may be required to pay significant back taxes, interests and/or penalties. The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Any significant proposed adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position if not resolved favorably.\nIn addition, a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate. For example, there has been increased scrutiny by the U.S. government on tax positions taken, and during February 2015, the United States Department of the Treasury issued a high-level outline of proposed modifications to international tax\nlaws for the fiscal year 2016. If any of these, or similar, proposals are passed, our statements of financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies, which could weaken our competitive position and harm our business.\nWe rely primarily on trade secrets and confidentiality procedures relating to our manufacturing processes to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts, these measures can only provide limited protection. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar products using processes or technologies developed by us, potentially harming our competitive position. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies.\nWe also rely on patent protection for some of our intellectual property. Our patents may be expensive to obtain and there is no guarantee that either our current or future patents will provide us with any competitive advantages. A third party may challenge the validity of our patents, or circumvent our patents by developing competing products based on technology that does not infringe our patents. Further, patent protection is not available at all in certain countries and some countries that do allow registration of patents do not provide meaningful redress for patent violations. As a result, protecting intellectual property in those countries is difficult, and competitors could sell products in those countries that have functions and features that would otherwise infringe on our intellectual property. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology and our business may be harmed.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nFrom time to time, we have received, and expect to continue to receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We could also be subject to claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights among us and our customers. Any claims brought against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management attention away from our business plan. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of our proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or require us to redesign any products or marks that incorporate the infringed intellectual property. In addition, we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology, and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to develop a non-infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nComplying with environmental laws and regulations or the environmental policies of our customers may increase our costs and reduce our profitability, and constrain our ability to expand in the locations where we current manufacture.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals, solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used in the manufacture of flexible printed circuits and component assemblies in our facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, certain of our customers have, or in the future may have, environmental policies with which we are required to comply that are more stringent than applicable laws and regulations. For example, certain of our customers are requesting that we voluntarily disclose data regarding our environmental discharge with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (\u201cIPE\u201d), which is a non-governmental organization in China. A significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in China, where we are subject to constantly evolving environmental regulation, including its revised Environmental Protection Law, effective January 1, 2015, and where certain jurisdictions have restricted granting additional licenses for manufacturing the types of products we produce. In addition, we are often required to obtain reports from our suppliers regarding the materials they provide to us. The costs of complying with any change in, or interpretation of, such regulations or customer policies and the costs of remedying potential violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental entities could be substantial.\nIn the event of a violation, we may be required to halt one or more segments of our operations until such violation is cured or we may be fined by a customer. The costs of remedying violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by governmental authorities could be substantial. Any remediation of environmental contamination would involve substantial expense that could harm our results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory or customer requirements to which our operations may be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws or customer policies will be administered or interpreted. Future regulations may be applied to materials, products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously. The costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations or policies could be significant.\nCompliance with regulations and customer demands regarding \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could significantly increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nSection 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) required the SEC to establish disclosure and reporting requirements regarding specified minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured by companies required to file reports with the SEC. The SEC adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from, or could have come from such areas. These rules may affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability of sufficient quantities of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, certain of our customers have implemented conflict mineral programs which are more stringent than the Dodd-Frank Act. There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure and our customers\u2019 requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of such minerals used in our products. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face commercial challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nPotential future acquisitions or strategic business alliances could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to consider acquisitions of, or business alliances with, companies, technologies and products that we feel could enhance our capabilities, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. We have limited experience in acquiring or partnering with other businesses and technologies. Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on our operating activities contained in the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, accounting and personnel;\n\u25cf\nproblems maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of our acquired companies;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\npotential costs incurred in executing on such a transaction, including any necessary debt or equity financing;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees; and\n\u25cf\ninability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition or start-up costs.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or partnerships, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or partnerships, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.\nWe face potential risks associated with loss, theft or damage of our property or the property of our customers.\nSome of our customers have entrusted us with proprietary equipment, intellectual property or confidential information to be used in the design, manufacture and testing of the products we make for them. In addition, the products we make for our customers themselves often contain proprietary or confidential property of our customers. In some instances, we face potentially millions of dollars in financial exposure to those customers if such equipment, products, intellectual property or confidential information is leaked, lost, damaged or stolen. Although we take precautions against such leakage, loss, theft or damage and we may insure against a portion of these risks, such insurance is expensive, may not be applicable to any loss we may experience and, even if applicable, may not be sufficient to cover any such loss. Further, in addition to monetary penalties, a customer could cancel outstanding orders or not place future orders if such a loss was to occur.\nLitigation may distract us from operating our business.\nLitigation that may be brought by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenditures and distract our management from the operations and conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in such litigation or resolve such litigation on terms favorable to us, which may adversely affect our operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. This effort is made more challenging by our significant overseas operations. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be misstated, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected. There can be no assurance that our internal controls over financial processes and reporting will be effective in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSales of our common stock by our majority stockholder could depress the price of our common stock or weaken market confidence in our prospects.\nWe have filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3, covering the re-sale of all 14,817,052 of our shares held by the WBL Entities. The WBL Entities may sell all or part of the shares of our common stock that it owns (or distribute those shares to its shareholders). A large influx of shares of our common stock into the market as a result of such sales, or the mere perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially, and may weaken market confidence in us or our prospects, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation or stock price. If there is a disposal by the WBL Entities of their shares of our common stock with value that exceeds certain prescribed thresholds and constitutes a major transaction under the rules of the Singapore Exchange, then such disposal may require the approval of the stockholders of UEL. The WBL Entities may be able to sell part of their shares of our common stock without requiring such stockholders\u2019 approval if such thresholds are not met; however, even such sale could impact the market price of our common stock. Further, these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including the trading price of our common stock, have historically been highly volatile. During the 12-month period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, the high and low sales prices for our common stock were $10.61 and $26.05 per share. Factors that could affect the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nfailure to complete the proposed Merger with DSBJ;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our financial results;\n\u25cf\nthe limited size of our public float;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or events affecting companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of our financial results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, although we have approximately 24.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015, approximately 14.8 million of those shares are held by the WBL Entities. As a result, there is a limited public float in our common stock. If any of our significant stockholders were to decide to sell a substantial portion of its shares the trading price of our common stock could decline. See \u201cRisk Factors-Sales of our common stock by our majority stockholder could depress the price of our common stock or weaken market confidence in our prospects\u201d for more information.\nIf certain requirements are not met, the SEC could impose sanctions against China-based members of certain accounting firms\u2019 networks, which could affect our ability to have those firms perform audits for us in the future.\nFrom time to time, the SEC requests access to the audit documents of Chinese US-listed companies from their accountants. Many of the accounting firms, including the Chinese members of the so-called Big Four accounting firms\u2019 networks, have historically refused to provide these records citing China\u2019s state law which specifies that certain Chinese company records can be claimed as state secrets. In January 2014, an SEC Administrative Law judge made an initial decision which determined that the Chinese members of the Big Four firms\u2019 networks, including PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP (\u201cPwC China\u201d), among others, should be suspended from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months, which includes, but is not limited to, performing audits of subsidiaries of companies that are registered with the SEC. This decision was stayed pending review, and in February 2015, the SEC announced that it had come to a settlement with the China-based firms associated with the Big Four firms, which settlement imposed sanctions against the firms and provides the SEC with authority to impose a variety of remedial measures on the firms if future\ndocument productions fail to meet specified criteria. Remedies for future non-compliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firm\u2019s performance of certain audit work.\nWe have substantial operations in China that are currently audited by PwC China, a member firm of the PwC network, of which our auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is also a member. If such a remedy was to be imposed on PwC China for failure to comply with the settlement, we could be unable to use PwC China, or any of the other affected accounting firms, to perform audits of our operations in China, and may have difficulty finding another firm with sufficient resources or experience to competently audit our Chinese entities. This could cause us to not meet our financial reporting obligations, which could negatively influence investor perceptions and cause a decline in our stock price.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management including, among other things, provisions providing for a classified board of directors, authorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock and the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions in our charter, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage delay or prevent potential takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.", "PERMNO": 90232, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "MFLX"}
