{"cik": "820318", "company": "II-VI INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return.\nWe continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components including those used for 3D sensing and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers\u2019 specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers\u2019 acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes.\nTo meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWidespread health crises, including the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and world. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our suppliers, customers, and employees as well as the impact to the countries and markets in which we operate. At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we began focusing intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by protecting our employees, suppliers, and customers.\nSignificant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship.\nWorkforce constraints triggered by shutdown orders and stay-at-home polices may present challenges in meeting our obligations to our customers and achieving cost and operational targets. For example, approximately 45% of our global facilities are subject to a government order, including approximately 10% that are currently closed, most of which are administrative facilities where employees are working remotely. We expect facilities to continue to be subject to similar government orders for the foreseeable future.\nWe may face disruptions from our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over their workforce capacity or their own financial or operational difficulties. There is also heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of other essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services.\nGovernmental and regulatory responses to the pandemic may include quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce\u2019s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nSuch efforts to ensure the safety of our workforce, customers, and suppliers may result in increased operating expenses and potentially jeopardize the efficiency of operations. Such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may adversely impact our results.\nWe have made efforts to identify, manage, and mitigate the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Company; however, there are factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this outbreak or any such similar outbreak, as well as further governmental and regulatory actions.\nGlobal economic downturns, including any downturn related to COVID-19, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nCurrent and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our Company\u2019s forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make.\nGlobal economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, on demand for our products.\nAdverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, or Chinese economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries.\nAdverse changes could also occur as a result of economic upswings, such as increased wages and scarce labor pools, and increased interest rates.\nThese changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSome systems that use our products are complex in design, and our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, and may expose us to litigation related to our products.\nSome systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nForeign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses.\nWe conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability.\nOur competitive position may still require significant investments.\nWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations.\nWe have in the past acquired several companies, including the completion of our acquisition of Finisar Corporation (\u201cFinisar\u201d) in September 2019. We may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions. We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.\nTo the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with:\n\u2022unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022conforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, processes, procedures, and controls with our operations, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications;\n\u2022coordinating new product and process development;\n\u2022increasing complexity from combining operations;\n\u2022increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; and\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we may:\n\u2022use a signification portion of our available cash;\n\u2022issue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022incur significant debt;\n\u2022incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities;\n\u2022incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and\n\u2022face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock or our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\u201d) could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market\u2019s or financial analysts\u2019 expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAlthough II-VI continues to expect that its acquisition of Finisar will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, the combined company may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.\nThe success of II-VI\u2019s acquisition of Finisar will continue to depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel of the two companies. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the combination if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the combination, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the combined company. In addition, II-VI continues to believe that the overall integration of Finisar will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company\u2019s business.\nPotential difficulties that the combined company may encounter in the integration process include:\n\u2022the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;\n\u2022the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers of both companies;\n\u2022the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;\n\u2022the reduction of the costs associated with each company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022the retention of key employees; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger.\nThe anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of the acquisition of Finisar assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.\nOur future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage.\nWe anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe manufacture products in the Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management\u2019s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner\nto issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability.\nWe are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.\n\u2022Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.\nChanges in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China.\nIn March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018 the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S entity list could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities, including Huawei, on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries with which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs.\nOur association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business, and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls. Additionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nAny inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy.\nWe borrow under our existing credit facility or to issue our equity to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.\nIn the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe may not be able to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash or repurchase the notes in accordance with their terms.\nHolders of our outstanding 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2022 and Finisar\u2019s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2036, which we refer to collectively as our convertible senior notes, have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing such notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion of such notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of surrendered notes, or pay cash with respect to notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of our notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the governing indenture, or to pay any cash upon conversion of the notes as required, would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our credit facility and any of our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of any such notes.\nOur credit agreement restricts our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.\nThe documents governing our amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of September 24, 2019, by and among us, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contain a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreements would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nWe may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers\u2019 demands.\nWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.\nCustomers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties.\nAlternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.\nWe may encounter increased competition and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors\u2019 or our customers\u2019 willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us.\nWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThere are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nAsserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in IP developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that IP or is jointly owned with the other party.\nA significant portion of our business is dependent on cyclical industries.\nOur business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe manufacture products in Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in laws and regulations governing data privacy and data protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties, or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nData breach incidents and breakdown of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\nIn the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.\nWe have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms.\nWe have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability.\nIf we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply.\nOur operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet.\nWe also make products for which the Company is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition, we produce and use other high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIncreases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.\nWe use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations.\nHazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including monitoring and specialized training, to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent.\nWe have in place an emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, and phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of its accidental release into the atmosphere.\nWith respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.\nThe generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.\nAlthough we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt (including our outstanding debt securities and borrowings under our Credit Agreement). Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets; seeking additional debt or equity; or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.\nUnfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate.\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.\nNatural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results.\nWe may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and requires continued good relations with our employees.\nWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.\nLarge end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them,\nincluding pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers.\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change regulations.\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate.\nWe may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.\nWe depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business.\nA small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually represent greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers.\nOur dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business.\nThe manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities.\nWe manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods, we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites.\nChanges in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. In addition, many of our products are sourced from\nsuppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs.\nFailure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.\nWe base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cthe Exchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\"the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or judgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.\nThe market price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Composite varied between a high of $51.90 and a low of $19.00 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022future announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022the overall performance of equity markets;\n\u2022the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022additions or changes to our board of directors, management, or key personnel;\n\u2022regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;\n\u2022the commencement or outcome of litigation;\n\u2022reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;\n\u2022gaining or losing large customers;\n\u2022the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;\n\u2022the issuance of common stock or other securities (including, without limitation, the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and the shares issued upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes);\n\u2022incurrence of indebtedness;\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast future performance;\n\u2022business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and\n\u2022changes in our operating industry generally.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and are experiencing exceptional volatility as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we expect that the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets, the time remaining to the Mandatory Conversion Date, our creditworthiness, and the occurrence of certain events affecting us that do not require an adjustment to the fixed conversion rates of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Fluctuations in yield rates in particular may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative values of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the market prices of our common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) and Amended and Restated By-Laws (the \u201cBy-Laws\u201d) and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the \u201cBCL\u201d) may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:\n\u2022a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).\nIn addition, the BCL contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:\n\u2022provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;\n\u2022restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and\n\u2022provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.\nRegardless of the amount of a person\u2019s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a \u201cshort-form\u201d merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.\nIn addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters\u2019 rights.\nFurthermore, the BCL provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation\u2019s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies\u2019 interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on \u201cpoison pills\u201d or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nAll of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.\nIn addition, certain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as described in the applicable Statement with Respect to Shares governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.\nWe have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our capital stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. If the terms of the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we will pay any dividends declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the form of shares of common stock. In addition, credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.\nIn addition, under Pennsylvania law, our board of directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Pennsylvania law to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nThe Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could depress possible sales of our common stock to\nshareholders who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, when issued; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 consolidated liabilities.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding a liquidation preference equal to $200.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.\nAs of June 30, 2020, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion, of which an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion was secured indebtedness of ours, to which the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would have been subordinated. In addition, we have the ability to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur board of directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.\nResearch analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.\nRegulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock who employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be adversely impacted by regulatory developments that may limit or restrict such a strategy. The SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that restrict and otherwise regulate short selling, over-the-counter swaps, and security-based swaps, which restrictions and regulations may adversely affect the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to conduct a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. This could, in turn, adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except under limited circumstances.\nHolders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except with respect to certain amendments to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in the case of certain dividend arrearages, in certain other limited circumstances, and except as specifically required by applicable Pennsylvania law or by our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no right to vote for any members of our board of directors, except in the case of certain dividend arrearages.\nIf dividends on any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the dividend period beginning on, and including, the initial issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and ending on, but excluding, October 1, 2020), whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain limitations.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.", "PERMNO": 11752, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "IIVI"}
