RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the banking business. The more significant of these are addressed by the Corporation\u2019s written policies and procedures. While management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risk, the Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. The Board fulfills its risk oversight responsibilities largely through its committees. The following provides information regarding risk factors faced by the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Corporation, or that the Corporation currently deems to be immaterial, could also have a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic and Market Area\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to pose risks and could harm business, results of operations and prospects of the Corporation.\nThe pandemic has had an adverse impact on the Corporation, its customers, employees, third-party service providers (\u201cTPSPs\u201d) and the communities it serves and, given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is expected that it will continue to have an adverse impact in the future. The extent of such future impact is difficult to predict and will depend on factors that are inherently uncertain such as when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated through widespread vaccination or otherwise, the extent and the danger posed by coronavirus variants and the success of fully reopening the economy. Additionally, the responses of various governmental authorities to curtail business and consumer activities in an effort to mitigate the pandemic could have a material long-term economic effect.\n\u200e\nThe Corporation is subject to the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\uf0b7effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting and internal controls;\n\uf0b7declines in demand for loans and other banking products and services, and a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, due to the economic effects of the pandemic in the markets we serve;\n\uf0b7high and sustained levels of unemployment which could result in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures, and may result in increases to the allowance for credit losses, increased charges and reduced income;\n\uf0b7collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\uf0b7the creditworthiness of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments;\n\uf0b7the yield on assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\uf0b7cyber security risks have increased due to an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and\n\uf0b7disruption in the capital markets may impact the performance of our investment securities portfolio and limit our access to capital markets and funding.\nA worsening of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeteriorating economic or business conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, the value of real estate collateral securing our mortgage loans, the financial strength of our borrowers and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values, sales volumes and employment levels together with increased vacancy rates, particularly in the New York metropolitan area given our concentration in this region, may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to increase our credit loss reserves, incur credit losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in New York.\nA concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase the risk of higher nonperforming assets.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island, and the boroughs of NYC as nearly all of our loans are to customers in these markets. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate new loans. A decline in real estate values in these market areas would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in these market areas.\nSevere weather, acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the New York metropolitan area remains central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, resulting from the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.\nCompetition within our market area could limit our ability to increase interest-earning assets.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokers, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, fintech or e-commerce companies, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, large competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Furthermore, fintech developments such as peer-to-peer platforms, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies have the potential to disrupt the financial services industry and change the way banks do business. Competitive forces may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. For additional information see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Competition.\u201d\nInterest Rate and Asset Quality\nThe inability to realize the full carrying value of the Bank\u2019s investment securities, loans and BOLI could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor investment securities, loans and BOLI, there is always the risk that the Bank will be unable to realize their full carrying value. Credit risk in the Bank\u2019s securities and BOLI portfolios has been addressed by adopting board committee approved investment and BOLI policies that, among other things, limit terms, types and amounts of holdings and specify minimum required credit ratings. Allowable investments include direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated obligations of states and political subdivisions, highly rated corporate obligations and BOLI policies issued by highly rated insurance carriers. At the time of purchase, bonds of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated AA or better, notes of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated MIG-1 (or equivalent), commercial paper must be rated A-1 or P-1, and corporate bonds of large U.S. based financial institutions must be rated BBB+ or better. BOLI may only be purchased from insurance carriers rated A or better. For carriers rated AA or better, cash surrender value is limited to 15% of Tier 1 capital, and for those carriers rated below AA, the limitation is 10% of Tier 1 capital. The cash surrender value of policies with all carriers, plus corporate bond holdings of such carriers, cannot exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio other than those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies and all BOLI carriers. Any significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issuer or carrier will be analyzed and action taken if deemed appropriate.\nCredit risk in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio has been addressed by adopting a board committee approved loan policy and by maintaining independent loan and appraisal review functions and an independent credit department. The loan policy contains what the Corporation believes to be prudent underwriting guidelines, which include, among other things, specific loan approval requirements, maximum loan terms, loan to appraised value and debt service coverage limits for mortgage loans, credit score minimums, guarantor support and environmental study requirements.\nThe credit risk within the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio primarily stems from factors such as changes in the borrower\u2019s financial condition, credit concentrations, changes in collateral values, economic conditions, rent regulation and environmental contamination of properties securing mortgage loans. The Bank\u2019s commercial loans, including those secured by mortgages, are primarily made to small and medium-sized businesses. Such loans sometimes involve a higher degree of risk than those to larger companies because such businesses may have shorter operating histories, higher debt-to-equity ratios and may lack sophistication in internal record keeping and financial and operational controls. In addition, most of the Bank\u2019s loans are made to businesses and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC, and a large percentage of these loans are mortgage loans secured by properties located in those areas. At December 31, 2020, residential mortgage loans, including home equity lines of credit, amounted to approximately $1.4 billion and comprised approximately 49% of loans secured by real estate. The primary source of repayment for residential mortgage loans is cash flows from individual borrowers and co-borrowers. Also, at December 31, 2020, multifamily loans amounted to approximately $777.0 million and comprised approximately 55% of the Bank\u2019s total commercial mortgage portfolio and approximately 28% of the Bank\u2019s total loans secured by real estate. The primary source of repayment for multifamily loans is cash flows from the underlying properties, a number of which are rent stabilized or rent controlled. Such cash flows for both residential mortgage and multifamily loans are dependent on the strength of the local economy.\nEnvironmental impairment of properties securing mortgage loans is always a risk. However, the Bank is not aware of any existing loans in the portfolio where there is environmental pollution originating on or near the mortgaged properties that would materially affect the value of the portfolio.\nChanges in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve could negatively impact our earnings.\nThe Bank\u2019s results of operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations and having assets and liabilities that have different maturity, repricing and prepayment/withdrawal characteristics. The Bank defines interest rate risk as the risk that the Bank's net interest income and/or economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d) will change when interest rates change. The Bank has addressed interest rate risk by adopting a board committee approved interest rate risk policy which sets forth quantitative risk limits and calls for monitoring and controlling interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and traditional repricing gap analysis. Management utilizes a consultant with expertise in bank asset liability management to aid in these efforts.\nIn a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on the Bank\u2019s assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on its liabilities. The Bank\u2019s cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios as its primary source of funds is deposits with generally shorter maturities than the maturities of its loans and investments. This makes the balance sheet more liability sensitive in the short-term.\nWhen interest rates decline, borrowers may refinance higher rate loans at lower rates causing prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to be elevated. Under those circumstances, the Bank may not be able to reinvest the resulting cash flows in new interest-earning assets with rates as favorable as those that prepaid. In addition, subject to the floors contained in many of the Bank\u2019s\nloan agreements, the Bank\u2019s loans at variable interest rates may adjust to lower rates at their reset dates. While lower rates may reduce the Bank\u2019s cost of funds on non-maturity deposits, certificates of deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d) and FHLB advances, the cost savings could be somewhat constrained because decreases in the Bank\u2019s funding rates may occur more slowly than decreases in yields earned on the Bank\u2019s assets and a significant portion of the Bank\u2019s funding is currently derived from noninterest bearing checking deposits and capital. In addition, in a prolonged low interest rate environment, the Bank\u2019s deposit products could reach an effective floor rate close to zero which would not allow for any further reduction in its cost of funds.\nIn addition to the risks arising from changes in interest rates, the current level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve could create downward pressure on net interest income and net interest margin. In a low interest rate environment with a flat or inverted yield curve, the Bank\u2019s earnings and profitability metrics could be negatively impacted by asset growth. As a result, the Bank may be unable to increase earnings, or maintain the current level of earnings, until the shape of the yield curve improves.\nRegulatory Matters\nUncertainty, changes in accounting rules and regulatory principals and other factors could result in a need to increase the Bank\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (\u201cACL\u201d or \u201callowance\u201d) and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank maintains an ACL in an amount believed to be adequate to absorb current expected lifetime credit losses in its loan portfolio. The maintenance of the ACL is governed by a board committee approved ACL policy. In arriving at the ACL, an individual evaluation is performed on each loan with disparate risk characteristics or information suggesting that the Bank will be unable to collect all the principal and interest due according to contractual terms. In addition, current expected lifetime credit losses for all other loans in the Bank\u2019s portfolio are determined on a pooled basis using the CECL model and taking into account historical loss experience and numerous quantitative and qualitative factors (\u201cQ-factors\u201d), including, among other things, current and forecasted economic conditions measured by such things as GDP, unemployment levels, vacancies and home prices, changes in the value of underlying collateral, average growth in loan pools, concentrations of credit, changes in lending policies and procedures, experience, ability and depth of lending staff, changes in quality of the loan review function, environmental risks and loan risk ratings. Because estimating the ACL is highly subjective in nature and involves a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, there is the risk that management\u2019s estimate may not accurately capture probable lifetime losses in the loan portfolio. The Bank\u2019s allowance may need to be increased based on, among other things, additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made, changes in circumstances or a recommendation by bank regulators based on their review of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. The impact of one or more of these factors on the Bank\u2019s allowance could result in the need for a significant increase in the Bank\u2019s provision for credit losses and have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose non-discriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. With respect to the Bank, the FRB, United States Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of the Bank\u2019s multifamily real estate loans could be adversely impacted by recent regulation.\nMultifamily real estate loans generally involve a greater risk than residential real estate loans because of legislation and government regulations involving rent control, rent stabilization and eviction, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank and could impair the value of the collateral for the loans or the future cash flow of such properties. In June 2019, New York State (\u201cNYS\u201d) passed The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (\u201cTPA\u201d), which represents a substantial change to the laws that have governed landlord-tenant relations in NYS for decades and significantly strengthens tenant protections. TPA increases the restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (1) repealing the vacancy bonus and longevity bonus, which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20% each time a rental unit became vacant, (2) eliminating high rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant\u2019s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (3) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. The new legislation still permits a property owner to charge up to the full legal rent once the tenant vacates. Because of this new legislation as well as previously existing laws and regulations, it is possible that rental income on multifamily properties might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced (e.g., if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral for the loan may be impaired. Therefore, impaired multifamily real estate loans may be more difficult to identify before they become problematic than residential real estate loans.\nChanges in laws, government regulation and supervisory guidance could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, among others, the FRB, OCC and FDIC. The FDIC also insures the Bank\u2019s deposits. Regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. Regulatory requirements affect virtually all aspects of the Corporation\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s business, including, among other things, investment practices, lending practices, deposit offerings and capital levels. The regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including imposing restrictions on Bank operations and expansion plans, imposing deposit insurance premiums and other assessments, setting required levels for the ACL, capital and liquidity, and imposing restrictions on the ability to pay cash dividends and other capital distributions to stockholders. Changes in laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, or the Corporation\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s compliance with these laws and regulations as judged by the regulators, could have a significant negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation manages the risk of noncompliance with laws and regulations by having board committee approved compliance policies, hiring and retaining employees with the experience and skills necessary to address compliance on an ongoing basis, and consulting, when necessary with legal counsel and other outside experts on compliance matters.\nBusiness Issues\nThe Bank and Corporation may not have sufficient funds or funding sources to meet liquidity demands.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will not have sufficient funds to accommodate loan growth, meet deposit outflows or make contractual payments on borrowing arrangements. The Bank has addressed liquidity risk by adopting a board committee approved liquidity policy and liquidity contingency plan that set forth quantitative risk limits and a protocol for responding to liquidity stress conditions should they arise. The Bank encounters significant competition for deposits in its market area from larger banks, various community banks, credit unions and other financial services organizations. This competition for deposits could result in significant outflows and can exert upward pressure on the Bank\u2019s funding costs. In addition, the Bank\u2019s concentration of deposits with certain customers could limit our ability to favorably reprice deposits and grow net interest income, net interest margin and earnings.\nThe Bank has both internal and external sources of liquidity that can be used to fund loan growth and accommodate deposit outflows. The Bank\u2019s primary internal sources of liquidity are overnight investments and maturities and monthly payments on its investment securities and loan portfolios.\nThe Bank is a member of the FRB of New York (\u201cFRBNY\u201d) and the FHLBNY and has a federal funds line with a commercial bank. In addition to customer deposits, the Bank\u2019s primary external sources of liquidity are secured borrowings from the FHLBNY and FRBNY. In addition, the Bank can purchase overnight federal funds under its existing line and the Corporation can raise funds through its DRIP. However, the Bank\u2019s FRBNY membership, FHLBNY membership and federal funds line do not represent legal commitments to extend credit to the Bank. The amount that the Bank can potentially borrow is currently dependent on, among other things, the amount of unencumbered eligible securities and loans that the Bank can use as collateral and the collateral margins required by the lenders.\nThe Corporation relies on dividends from the Bank to fund its operating expenses, dividends to shareholders and repurchases of common stock. The OCC restricts the dividends the Bank may pay to the Corporation to its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus current year retained net profits. These restrictions may limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. In addition, the Corporation may not be successful in raising funds from the issuance of its stock under the DRIP or otherwise.\nA decline in the Corporation\u2019s market capitalization could negatively impact the price, trading volume and liquidity of our common stock.\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock is included in the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes, which are reconstituted annually. Upon reconstitution in May 2020, the average market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000 Index was $1.9 billion, the median market capitalization was $580.0 million, the capitalization of the largest company in the index was $4.4 billion and the capitalization of the smallest company in the index was $94.8 million. The Corporation\u2019s market capitalization on December 31, 2020 was approximately $425 million, below the $500 million market capitalization which may make the Corporation\u2019s common stock more attractive to certain investors. The Corporation believes that inclusion in the Russell indexes has positively impacted the price, trading volume and liquidity of its common stock. Conversely, if the Corporation\u2019s market capitalization falls below the minimum necessary to be included in the indexes at any future reconstitution date, the opposite could occur. The Corporation also believes that the activity under its stock repurchase program has positively impacted the price and trading volume of its common stock. Discontinuance of the stock repurchase program could have the opposite effect.\nThe Bank\u2019s internal controls and those of its third-party service providers may be ineffective or circumvented, resulting in significant financial loss, adverse action by governmental bodies and damaged reputation.\nThe Corporation relies on its system of internal controls and the internal controls of its TPSPs to ensure that transactions are captured, recorded, processed and reported properly; confidential customer information is safeguarded; and fraud by employees and persons outside the Corporation is detected and prevented. The Corporation\u2019s internal controls and/or those of its TPSPs may prove to be ineffective or employees of the Corporation and/or its TPSPs may fail to comply with or override the controls, either of which could result in significant financial loss to the Corporation, adverse action by bank regulatory authorities or the SEC and damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nThe Bank\u2019s inability to keep pace with technological advances could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe delivery of financial products and services has increasingly become technology-driven. The Bank\u2019s ability to competitively meet the needs of its customers in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on its ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract, motivate or retain qualified key personnel could negatively impact our performance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s future success depends in part on the continued service of its executive officers and other key members of management and its staff, as well as its ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of services of key personnel and our inability to timely recruit or promote qualified replacements could have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Their skills, knowledge of the Bank\u2019s market and years of industry experience may be difficult to replace.\nSecurity\nSystem failures, interruptions and security breaches could negatively impact our customers, reputation and results of operations.\nThe Bank outsources most of its data processing to TPSPs. If TPSPs encounter difficulties, or if the Bank has difficulty communicating with them, the Bank\u2019s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Bank\u2019s business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through TPSPs. The Bank\u2019s website and online banking products have been the target of cyber attacks in the past. While the Bank and its TPSPs believe they have successfully blocked attempts to infiltrate the Bank\u2019s systems, there is always the possibility that successful attacks have not yet been identified and future attacks may not be blocked. A significant cybersecurity incident may be determined to be material insider information and would prohibit corporate insiders from trading in Company stock until appropriate public disclosures are made.\nOpportunistic cyberattacks and malicious financial crimes have been growing globally in number and complexity and increase the cost of technology, compliance and labor. The Risk Committee of the Board has oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risk, compliance and technology which it administers through periodic meetings with management and consultants with cybersecurity expertise and the approval of information technology and cybersecurity policies. In this regard, board committee approved policies address information security, IT vulnerability assessment, cybersecurity incident response and electronic communications. These policies are intended to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, these policies prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches and rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary for the processing of data. The Bank makes use of logon and user access controls, multifactor and out of band authentication, transaction limits, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion protection monitoring and vulnerability scans and conducts independent penetration testing and cybersecurity audits. Bank communications encourage employee and executive awareness of cybersecurity trends. System failures or interruptions are addressed in the board committee approved emergency and disaster recovery policy and business continuity policy. In addition, for TPSPs of data processing and other significant services, the board committee approved third party management policy and procedures require reviews of audit reports prepared by independent registered public accounting firms regarding their financial condition and the effectiveness of their internal controls.\nThese precautions may not protect our systems from all compromises or breaches of security and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. The Bank carries a cyber liability insurance policy to mitigate the amount of any financial loss. However, the occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security could damage the Bank\u2019s reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose the Bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability beyond any insurance coverage. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11006, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FLIC"}
