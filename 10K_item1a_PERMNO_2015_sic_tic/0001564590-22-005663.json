In addition, we are also currently subject to risks associated with real estate ownership, our indebtedness, as well as our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for those years we elected REIT status. The risks and uncertainties set forth below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements contained herein and elsewhere. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nResistance to privatization of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and negative publicity regarding inmate disturbances or perceived poor operational performance, could result in our inability to obtain new contracts, the loss of existing contracts, or other unforeseen consequences.\nPrivatization of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities has not achieved complete acceptance by either government agencies or the public at large. The operation of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities by private entities has encountered resistance from certain groups, such as labor unions, prison reform organizations, activists and others that believe that correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities should only be operated by governmental agencies. Any political platform or promise, governmental agency report, investigation or inquiry, public statement by any governmental agency, policy or legislative change, or other similar occurrence or action, that seeks to, or purports to, prohibit, eliminate, or otherwise restrict or limit in any way, the federal government\u2019s (or any state or local government\u2019s) ability to contract with private operators of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, could negatively impact our growth and our ability to renew or maintain existing contracts or to obtain new contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock.\nOn January 26, 2021, President Biden issued the Private Prison EO. The Private Prison EO directs the Attorney General to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. Two agencies of the DOJ, the BOP and the USMS, utilize our services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial. The BOP has experienced a steady decline in inmate populations over the last eight years, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently have one prison contract with the BOP at our 1,978-bed McRae Correctional Facility, accounting for 2% ($40.6 million) of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which expires in November 2022. The Private Prison EO only applies to agencies that are part of the DOJ, which includes the BOP and USMS. ICE facilities are not covered by the Private Prison EO, as ICE is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOJ, although it is possible that the federal government could choose to take similar action on ICE facilities in the future. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, USMS and ICE accounted for 23% ($433.6 million) and 30% ($552.2 million), respectively, of our total revenue.\nUnlike the BOP, the USMS does not own detention capacity and relies on the private sector, along with various government agencies, for its detainee population. The USMS has been advised by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General not to renew existing contracts, or enter into new contracts for private detention facilities. During the second quarter of 2021, we had direct contracts with the USMS for up to 992 detainees at our 2016-bed Northeast Ohio Correctional Center and for up to approximately 96 detainees at our 664-bed Crossroads Correctional Center in Montana that expired and were not renewed. On May 28, 2021, we entered into a new three-year contract with Mahoning County, Ohio to utilize up to 990 beds at our Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. Mahoning County is responsible for County inmates and federal detainees, including USMS detainees, and the County is using the Northeast Ohio facility to address its population needs. During the third quarter of 2021, we entered into an amendment to the contract with the state of Montana to utilize all of the capacity at the Crossroads Correctional Center, including the space vacated by the USMS, and to extend the existing contract to June 30, 2023, with additional renewal options by mutual agreement through August 31, 2029. We had a direct contract with the USMS to care for detainees at our 600-bed West Tennessee Detention Facility that expired on September 30, 2021 and was not renewed. In addition, we had a direct contract with the USMS to care for detainees at our 1,033-bed Leavenworth Detention Center that expired on December 31, 2021 and was not renewed. We are actively marketing the West Tennessee and Leavenworth facilities to other government agencies, and in August 2021, we submitted a formal response to a government agency's request for proposal to utilize the West Tennessee facility. We are also currently in discussions with, and have submitted proposals to, other potential government partners to utilize the Leavenworth facility. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to reach agreements for the utilization of the West Tennessee or Leavenworth facilities.\nWe currently have six detention facilities that have separate contracts where the USMS is the primary customer within the facility that all expire at various times over the next several years, with the exception of two contracts that have indefinite terms. As of December 31, 2021, one of the aforementioned six contracts, a contract with a government agency at our 2,672-bed Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi that allows the USMS to utilize available capacity, expires in June 2022. Non-renewal of these contracts, or the expansion of the Private Prison EO to ICE, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations if we are unable to replace the cash flows with new management contracts like we did at our Northeast Ohio and Crossroads facilities.\nIn addition, negative publicity regarding offenders escaping, rioting or any other disturbances at our facilities or any public perception of poor operational performance at our facilities, contract non-compliance, or other conditions (including COVID-19 infections or other disease outbreaks at the facilities we own and manage) at a privately managed facility may result in adverse publicity to us and the private corrections industry in general and could negatively impact our growth and our ability to renew or maintain existing contracts or to obtain new contracts, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in occupancy levels, and a decrease in occupancy levels could cause a decrease in revenues and profitability.\nWhile a substantial portion of our cost structure is fixed, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated under facility ownership and management contracts that specify per diem payments based upon daily or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels. We are dependent upon the governmental agencies with which we have contracts to provide offenders for facilities we operate. We cannot control occupancy levels at the facilities we operate. We do not lobby or advocate for any policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual's incarceration or detention. Under a per diem rate structure, a decrease in our occupancy rates could cause a decrease in revenue and profitability. For the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the average compensated occupancy of our facilities, based on rated capacity, was 72%, 74%, and 82%, respectively, for all of the facilities we operated, exclusive of facilities that are leased to third-party operators where our revenue is generally not based on daily occupancy. Occupancy rates may, however, decrease below these levels in the future, including as a result of COVID-19. When combined with relatively fixed costs for operating each facility, a decrease in occupancy levels could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe are dependent on government appropriations, and our results of operations may be negatively affected by governmental budgetary challenges or government shutdowns.\nOur cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of, and timely payment by, contracting governmental entities. If the appropriate governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations, it may terminate our contract or delay or reduce payment to us. While we have historically been required to continue to perform under our government contracts during government shutdowns, we are generally not paid until the government reopens. Any delays in payment, or the termination of a contract, could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition. In addition, federal, state and local governments are constantly under pressure to control additional spending or reduce current levels of spending. In prior years, these pressures have been compounded by economic downturns. Accordingly, we have been requested and may be requested in the future to reduce our existing per diem contract rates or forego prospective increases to those rates. Further, our government partners could reduce offender population levels in facilities we own or manage to contain their correctional costs. In addition, it may become more difficult to renew our existing contracts on favorable terms or otherwise.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative effects on our business, and such effects may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented measures taken by United States federal, state and local government authorities in an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative effects on our business, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nThe decision imposed by the federal government to deny entry at the United States southern border to asylum-seekers and anyone crossing the United States southern border without proper documentation or authority in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a reduction in ICE populations, including in our detention facilities. Litigation challenging the policy of denying entry at the United States southern border to asylum-seekers and anyone crossing the border without proper documentation or authority continues. On August 13, 2021, a federal court ordered the Biden administration to reinstate the MPP enacted by the Trump administration, finding that terminating MPP would be illegal \"until the Department of Homeland Security has the capacity and willingness to detain immigrants.\" On August 24, 2021, the Supreme Court refused to block implementation of that order. On October 29, 2021, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas issued a memorandum asserting the termination of MPP, which was structured to be implemented if the decision reinstating MPP is vacated. The memorandum also provides that the Biden administration will continue to comply with the injunction requiring the reinstatement and enforcement of MPP until a final judicial decision, if any, to vacate such injunction is issued. In early December 2021, the Department of Homeland Security began the court-ordered re-implementation of the MPP, and on December 13, 2021, a federal appeals court rejected the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to terminate MPP. On December 29, 2021, the Biden administration appealed\nthis decision to the Supreme Court. Separately, on September 16, 2021, a federal judge prohibited the Biden administration from expelling migrant families pursuant to Trump-era public health restrictions finding that public health law does not authorize the expulsion of migrants. On September 30, 2021, a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay on the prohibition on expelling migrant families pursuant to Trump-era public health restrictions. As a result, the Biden administration has been able to expel migrant families pursuant to public health concerns over the spread of COVID-19 while the litigation of such policy continues.\n\u2022\nDisruptions to the criminal justice system as a result of COVID-19 have contributed to a reduction in the number of USMS populations and state populations in our correctional and detention facilities, as the number of courts in session, arrests, and prosecutions have declined. Disruptions to the criminal justice system have also resulted in fewer referrals to both our residential reentry facilities and programs in our non-residential criminal justice services business. As long as COVID-19 related restrictions on individuals, businesses, and services, along with government policies on prosecutions, and newly ordered legal restrictions associated with COVID-19 that affect the number of people placed in correctional, detention, and reentry facilities, remain in effect, we expect the disruption in the criminal justice system to continue.\n\u2022\nWe have had positive COVID-19 cases at our facilities. While we are taking measures to protect our employees and those entrusted to our care, which have included, but are not limited to, enhanced hygiene practices, the suspension or restriction of visitation policies (after consultation with our government partners), following guidance provided by the CDC for Correctional and Detention Facilities, following national and local health standards, and the separation of vulnerable inmate populations from the rest of the inmate population for their protection, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among our employees and those entrusted to our care and, as a result, we may face disruptions at our facilities. For example, an inability to fully staff our correctional, detention, and reentry facilities could result in negative consequences, including reduced residential populations, fines, other penalties, or contract cancellations.\n\u2022\nCertain government agencies have released, may be considering releasing, or may be experiencing pressure to release, certain inmates and detainees as a result of COVID-19. It is possible that government agencies, which may include our government partners, could release certain inmates and detainees from correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, which could reduce the utilization of our facilities and our services, and could occur as a result of legal decisions. In addition, our government partners could require us to transfer inmates or detainees to other facilities in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak at one of our facilities.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced labor shortages and wage pressures in many markets across the country and our personnel costs and expenses at our facilities have increased as a result of COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have, among other things, purchased PPE and supplies, increased compensation and provided additional benefits to staff at our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and implemented enhanced hygiene practices at our facilities.\n\u2022\nGovernment agencies and referring boards have decided, and may continue to decide, to refer residents to home confinement or otherwise reduce the utilization of community facilities, such as our residential reentry facilities.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party service providers and business partners, such as suppliers, distributors, contractors and other external businesses, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers are subject to risks and uncertainties related to COVID-19, (including those broader supply chain delays and disruptions currently impacting domestic and global distribution of products), which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms.\n\u2022\nActions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of COVID-19, may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by federal, state and local government authorities and other third parties in response to COVID-19. Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompetition may adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nWe compete with government entities and other private operators on the basis of bed availability, cost, quality and range of services offered, experience in designing, constructing, and managing facilities, and reputation of management and personnel. While there are barriers to entering the market for the ownership and management of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, these barriers may not be sufficient to limit additional competition. In addition, our government customers may assume the management of a facility that they own and we currently manage for them upon the termination of the corresponding management contract or, if such customers have capacity at their facilities, may take offenders and residents currently cared for in our facilities and transfer them to government-run facilities. Since we are paid on a per diem basis with no minimum guaranteed occupancy under most of our contracts, the loss of such offenders and residents, and the resulting decrease in occupancy, would cause a decrease in our revenues and profitability.\nWe are subject to terminations, non-renewals, or competitive re-bids of our government contracts.\nWe typically enter into facility contracts with governmental entities for terms of up to five years, with additional renewal periods at the option of the contracting governmental agency. Notwithstanding any contractual renewal option of a contracting governmental agency, 30 of our facility contracts with the customers listed under \"Business - Facility Portfolio\" are currently scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2022 but have renewal options (16), or are currently scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2022 and have no renewal options (14). Although we generally expect these customers to exercise renewal options or negotiate new contracts with us, one or more of these contracts may not be renewed and we may not be able to negotiate a new contract on favorable terms or at all with the corresponding governmental agency. In addition, these and any other contracting agencies may determine not to exercise renewal options with respect to any of our contracts in the future. Our government partners can also re-bid contracts in a competitive procurement process upon termination or non-renewal of our contract. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial term and any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to further competitive pricing and other terms for the government agency. The aggregate revenue earned during the year ended December 31, 2021 for the 30 contracts with scheduled maturity dates, notwithstanding contractual renewal options, on or before December 31, 2022 was $367.6 million, or 20% of total revenue.\nAdditionally, the Private Prison EO issued by President Biden on January 26, 2021, directs the Attorney General to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. Two agencies of the DOJ, the BOP and the USMS, utilize our services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial. The BOP has experienced a steady decline in inmate populations over the last eight years, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently have one prison contract with the BOP at our 1,978-bed McRae Correctional Facility, accounting for 2% ($40.6 million) of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which expires in November 2022. The Private Prison EO only applies to agencies that are part of the DOJ, which includes the BOP and USMS. ICE facilities are not covered by the Private Prison EO, as ICE is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOJ, although it is possible that the federal government could choose to take similar action on ICE facilities in the future. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, USMS and ICE accounted for 23% ($433.6 million) and 30% ($552.2 million), respectively, of our total revenue.\nUnlike the BOP, the USMS does not own detention capacity and relies on the private sector, along with various government agencies, for its detainee population. The USMS has been advised by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General not to renew existing contracts, or enter into new contracts for private detention facilities. We currently have six detention facilities that have separate contracts where the USMS is the primary customer within the facility that all expire at various times over the next several years, with the exception of two contracts that have indefinite terms. As of December 31, 2021, one of the aforementioned six contracts, a contract with a government agency at our 2,672-bed Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi that allows the USMS to utilize available capacity, expires in June 2022. Non-renewal of these contracts, or the expansion of the Private Prison EO to ICE, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations if we are unable to replace the cash flows with new management contracts like we did at our Northeast Ohio and Crossroads facilities, as previously described herein.\nOur managed-only contract for the 1,030-bed Marion County Jail in Indianapolis, Indiana terminated and operations transitioned to Marion County effective January 31, 2022. Marion County constructed a replacement facility that became fully operational in January 2022. The County intends to redevelop the property where the Marion County Jail was located, and we received notice in the second quarter of 2021 that the County intended to terminate the contract effective December 31, 2021. The contract was subsequently amended and extended through January 31, 2022 to allow the County more time to prepare for the transition.\nGovernmental agencies typically may terminate a facility contract at any time without cause or use the possibility of termination to negotiate a lower per diem rate. In the event any of our contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain additional replacement contracts. The non-renewal, termination, renegotiation or competitive re-bid of any of our contracts with governmental agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility contracts from others.\nBased on information available as of the date of this Annual Report, other than the previously mentioned contract with the USMS at our Tallahatchie facility and the contract with the BOP at our McRae facility, for which future utilization by the USMS and the BOP, respectively, is uncertain, and at the managed-only Marion County Jail, we believe we will renew all other contracts with our government partners that have expired or are scheduled to expire within the next twelve months that could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. We believe our renewal rate on existing contracts remains high due to a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the constrained supply of available beds within the U.S. correctional system, our ownership of the majority of the beds we operate, and the cost effectiveness of the services we provide. However, we cannot assure we will continue to achieve such renewal rates in the future.\nOur ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities depends on many factors outside our control.\nOur growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities. This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions, governmental budgetary constraints, governmental responses to COVID-19, and governmental and public acceptance of privatization. The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, the expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws, disruptions to the criminal justice system, including as a result of COVID-19, or as a result of COVID-19 related responses by governmental entities intended to address and/or mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including the decision to release persons entrusted to our care. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional or detention facilities to house them. Immigration reform laws are currently a focus for legislators and politicians at the federal, state, and local level. Legislation has also been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. On December 21, 2018, President Trump signed legislation, known as The First Step Act, that reduces sentences for first-time offenders in possession of a gun when committing a crime, eliminates mandating life-time sentences for three-time offenders, provides judges more discretion in crafting sentences for some drug-related offenses, and allows offenders to seek a retroactive reduction in sentences affected\nby the disparity in the sentences for crack and powder cocaine cases narrowed by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. (Although, under long-standing policy, CoreCivic does not draft, lobby for, promote, or in any way take a position on policies that determine the basis or duration of an individual's incarceration or detention, CoreCivic supported adoption of The First Step Act because the legislation aligns with our publicly stated commitment to advocate for a range of recidivism-reducing policies by providing additional resources to help ensure that incarcerated individuals are given the best possible chance to successfully return to their communities and stay out of prison.) Also, the expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, the utilization of which may increase in response to COVID-19, such as electronic monitoring, may reduce the number of offenders who would otherwise be incarcerated or detained. Similarly, reductions in crime rates, increases in resources dedicated to prevent crime, reduced funding for law enforcement, or strained law enforcement resources could lead to a reduction in arrests, which could lead to a decrease in convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.\nMoreover, certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project, a trend that could significantly burden our capital resources to remain competitive. We may compete for such projects with companies that have more financial resources than we have. Further, we may not be able to obtain the capital resources when needed. A prolonged downturn in the financial capital markets or in our stock price could make it more difficult to obtain capital resources at favorable rates of return or obtain capital resources at all.\nWe may face community opposition to facility location, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts.\nOur success in obtaining new awards and contracts sometimes depends, in part, upon our ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired, on economically favorable terms, by us or other entities working with us in conjunction with our proposal to construct and/or manage a facility. Some locations may be in or near populous areas and, therefore, may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site. When selecting project sites, we attempt to conduct business in communities where local leaders and residents generally support the establishment of a privatized correctional, detention, or residential reentry facility. Even if we identify sites where local leaders and residents generally support the establishment of a correctional or detention facility, whether to be publicly or privately operated, such endeavors may still face resistance by broader groups to facilities perceived as supporting over-incarceration. Therefore, future efforts to find suitable host communities may not be successful. We may incur substantial costs in evaluating the feasibility of the development of a correctional or detention facility. As a result, we may report significant charges if we decide to abandon efforts to develop a correctional or detention facility on a particular site. Further, in many cases, the site selection is made by the contracting governmental entity. In such cases, site selection may be made for reasons related to political and/or economic development interests and may lead to the selection of sites that have less favorable environments.\nProviding family residential services increases certain unique risks and difficulties compared to operating our other facilities.\nIn September 2014, we signed an amended agreement to provide at the South Texas Family Residential Center safe and humane residential housing, as well as educational opportunities, to women and children (but no unaccompanied children) under the custody of ICE, who are awaiting their due process before immigration courts. In October 2016, we entered into an amended agreement that extended the term of the 2014 agreement through September 2021. The term of the amended agreement was further extended in September 2020, from September 2021 to September 2026. ICE has modified the mission at this facility in the past, for example, to authorize two parent family units. During the fourth quarter of 2021, ICE suspended the placement of children at this facility, but continues to use the facility under the Family Residential Standards for people claiming asylum. Depending on the demands at the southern border, ICE could again in the future place children at this facility for residential services. Providing family residential services, particularly to children, subjects us to unique risks such as unanticipated increased costs and litigation that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, the contract mandates resident-to-staff ratios that are higher than our typical contract, requires services unique to this contract (e.g. child care and primary education services), and limits the use of security protocols and techniques typically utilized in correctional and detention settings. These operational risks and others, including risks relating to COVID-19, associated with privately managing this type of residential facility could result in higher costs associated with staffing and lead to increased litigation.\nNumerous lawsuits, to which we are not a party, have challenged the government's policy of detaining migrant families, and government policies with respect to family immigration may impact the demand for the South Texas Family Residential Center. Any court decision or government action that impacts our existing contract for the South Texas Family Residential Center could materially affect our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, revenues at this facility were $159.9 million, $168.0 million, and $171.1 million, respectively.\nWe may incur significant start-up and operating costs on new contracts before receiving related revenues, which may impact our cash flows and not be recouped.\nWhen we are awarded a contract to provide or manage a facility, we may incur significant start-up and operating expenses, including the cost of constructing the facility, purchasing equipment and staffing the facility, before we receive any payments under the contract. We may also experience a disruption in cash flows when transitioning from one contract to another. For example, during 2022, as a result of a new contract award from the state of Arizona for up to 2,706 inmates, we expect to transition the population at our 3,060-bed La Palma Correctional Center from ICE detainees to inmates from the state of Arizona, which will result in the disruption of earnings and cash flows until the occupancy of inmates from the state of Arizona reaches stabilization. Disruptions like these could result in a significant reduction in our cash reserves and may make it more difficult for us to meet other cash obligations. In addition, a contract may be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration, and as a result, we may not recover these expenditures or realize any return on our investment.\nGovernment agencies may investigate and audit our contracts and operational performance, and if any deficiencies or improprieties are found, we may be required to cure those deficiencies or improprieties, refund revenues we have received, or forego anticipated revenues, and we may be subject to penalties and sanctions, including contract termination and prohibitions on our bidding in response to Requests for Proposals.\nGovernmental agencies with which we contract have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them. As part of that process, government agencies may review our performance of the contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable performance requirements, laws, regulations and standards, including those related to COVID-19. The regulatory and contractual environment in which we operate is complex and many aspects of our operations remain subject to manual processes and oversight that make compliance monitoring difficult and resource intensive. A governmental agency audit, review or investigation could result in a request to cure a performance or compliance issue, and if we are unable to, or otherwise fail to do so, the failure could lead to the imposition of monetary penalties or revenue deductions, or the termination of the contract in question and/or other contracts that we have with that governmental agency. Similarly, for contracts that actually or effectively provide for certain reimbursement of expenses, if an agency determines that we have improperly\nallocated costs to a specific contract, we may not be reimbursed for those expenses, and we could be required to refund the amount of any such expenses that have been reimbursed. If a government audit asserts improper or illegal activities by us, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with certain government entities. In addition to the potential civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, any adverse determination with respect to contractual or regulatory violations could negatively impact our ability to bid in response to Requests for Proposals, or RFPs, in one or more jurisdictions.\nFailure to comply with facility contracts or with unique and increased governmental regulation could result in material penalties or non-renewal or termination of noncompliant contracts or our other contracts to provide or manage correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations, including educational, environmental, health care, data privacy, transportation, telecommunications, and safety regulations, which are administered by many regulatory authorities. Some of the regulations are unique to the corrections industry, some target private, for-profit entities by imposing location requirements, compliance requirements, elevated litigation risk and financial penalties only on private, for-profit correction and detention providers, some are unique to government contractors, and the combination of regulations we face is unique and complex. Facility management contracts typically include reporting requirements, supervision, and on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies. Corrections and reentry personnel are customarily required to meet certain training standards and, in some instances, facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation. Certain jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with certain types of businesses, such as small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups. Our facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which we have contracts. Federal regulations also require federal government contractors like us to self-report evidence of certain forms of misconduct. We may not always successfully comply with these regulations and contract requirements, and failure to comply can result in material penalties, including financial penalties, non-renewal or termination of noncompliant contracts and/or our other facility contracts, exclusion from new contract procurement or RFP bidding, and suspension or debarment from contracting with certain government entities.\nIn addition, private prison managers are subject to government legislation and regulation attempting to restrict the ability of private prison managers to house certain types of inmates, such as inmates from other jurisdictions or inmates at medium or higher security levels. Legislation has been enacted in several states, and has previously been proposed in the United States Congress, containing such restrictions. Such legislation, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on us.\nThere also has been increasing focus by U.S. and foreign government authorities on environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and restrictions on our business operations.\nOur inmate transportation subsidiary, TransCor, is subject to regulations promulgated by the Departments of Transportation and Justice. TransCor must also comply with the Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000, which covers operational aspects of transporting prisoners, including, but not limited to, background checks and drug testing of employees; employee training; employee hours; staff-to-inmate ratios; prisoner restraints; communication with local law enforcement; and standards to help ensure the safety of prisoners during transport. Any changes in such regulations could result in an increase in the cost of our transportation operations.\nFrom time to time, we enter into agreements with telecommunications providers to provide telephone services to residents in our facilities. Although we are not a telecommunications provider, these services are subject to regulations which may change from time to time. We are subject to the direct and indirect effects of these regulations. Non-compliance with these regulations, either by us or by our telecommunications providers, subjects us to risks which could result in increases to our costs or decreases in our revenue. The impact to our revenue is limited because a significant amount of commissions paid by our telecommunications providers is passed along to our customers or is reserved and must be used for the benefit of offenders in our care.\nWe depend on a limited number of governmental customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of governmental agencies. The three primary federal governmental agencies with correctional and detention responsibilities, ICE, the USMS, and the BOP accounted for 56% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 ($1,050.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2021, ICE, USMS, and the BOP accounted for 30% ($552.2 million), 23% ($433.6 million), and 3% ($64.7 million), respectively, of our total revenue. Although the revenue generated from each of these agencies is derived from numerous management contracts and various types of properties, i.e. correctional, detention, and reentry, the loss or substantial reduction in value of one or more of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We expect to continue to depend upon these federal agencies and a relatively small group of other governmental customers for a significant percentage of our revenues.\nAdditionally, the Private Prison EO issued by President Biden on January 26, 2021, directs the Attorney General to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. Two agencies of the DOJ, the BOP and the USMS, utilize our services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial. The BOP has experienced a steady decline in inmate populations over the last eight years, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently have one prison contract with the BOP at our 1,978-bed McRae Correctional Facility, accounting for 2% ($40.6 million) of our total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which expires in November 2022. The Private Prison EO only applies to agencies that are part of the DOJ, which includes the BOP and USMS. ICE facilities are not covered by the Private Prison EO, as ICE is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, not the DOJ, although it is possible that the federal government could choose to take similar action on ICE facilities in the future. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, USMS and ICE accounted for 23% ($433.6 million) and 30% ($552.2 million), respectively, of our total revenue.\nUnlike the BOP, the USMS does not own detention capacity and relies on the private sector, along with various government agencies, for its detainee population. The USMS has been advised by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General not to renew existing contracts, or enter into new contracts for private detention facilities. We currently have six detention facilities that have separate contracts where the USMS is the primary customer within the facility that all expire at various times over the next several years, with the exception of two contracts that have indefinite terms. As of December 31, 2021, one of the aforementioned six contracts, a contract with a government agency at our 2,672-bed Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi that allows the USMS to utilize available capacity, expires in June 2022. Non-renewal of these contracts, or the expansion of the Private Prison EO to ICE, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations if we are unable to replace the cash flows with new management contracts like we did at our Northeast Ohio and Crossroads facilities, as previously described herein.\nAs previously mentioned herein, revenue from our South Texas Family Residential Center was $159.9 million in 2021, $168.0 million in 2020, and $171.1 million in 2019. The loss or reduction in value of this contract, whether due to change in mission, legal challenges, or change in government policy, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded and will continue to record goodwill and other intangible assets. In the future, our goodwill or other intangible assets may become impaired, which could result in non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe have goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, and we could record additional goodwill and other intangible assets if we consummate additional business acquisitions in the future. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually, and whenever circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We will continue to evaluate the goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if there are changes in assumptions related to our capital structure and cost of debt and equity and operating cash flows, as well as considerations related to our equity valuation. Impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets could require non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our senior management and our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on the ability and experience of our senior management. The unexpected loss of any of these persons could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn addition, the services we provide are labor-intensive. The success of our business, and our ability to satisfy the staffing and operational performance requirements of our contracts, require that we attract, hire, develop and retain sufficient qualified personnel. When we are awarded a facility management contract or open a new facility, we must hire operating management, correctional officers, and other personnel. Our inability to hire sufficient qualified personnel on a timely basis, or experiencing excessive turnover or the loss of significant personnel at existing facilities, could adversely affect our business and operations. Many of our contracts include specific staffing requirements, and our failure to satisfy such requirements may result in the imposition of financial penalties or loss of contract. Staffing challenges have recently been exacerbated by labor shortages in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, as a federal government contractor, part of our workforce is covered by the vaccine mandate imposed by Executive Order on September 9, 2021; however, a federal judge issued an injunction halting this vaccine mandate on January 21, 2022. Litigation continues, and the future status of this vaccine mandate is unresolved. Additionally, certain of our other governmental partners have implemented or are subject to certain COVID-19 related vaccine or testing directives, which are also applicable to us and our workforce. Our compliance with these requirements, as well as our compliance with any applicable vaccine or testing mandates that may be adopted in the future, may disrupt our workforce and operations and impose additional compliance and other costs. The requirements could also result in attrition, including attrition of qualified personnel, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various types of litigation.\nLegal proceedings related to, and adverse developments in our relationship with, our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to claims and legal proceedings related to employment matters. Because the resolution of claims and legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, there can be no assurance we will be successful in defending against such claims or legal proceedings, or that management's assessment of the materiality of these matters, including the reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or legal proceedings. In the event management's assessment of materiality of current claims and legal proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future, the resolution of such matters may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed 10,350 full- and part-time employees. Approximately 1,110 of our employees at six of our facilities, or approximately 10.7% of our workforce, are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any of our facilities and, in the opinion of management, overall employee relations are good. New executive orders, administrative rules and changes in National Labor Relations could increase organizing activity at locations where employees are currently not represented by a labor organization. Increases in organizational activity or any future work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings associated with owning and managing correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities. Our ownership and management of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, and the provision of inmate transportation services by a subsidiary, expose us to potential third-party claims or litigation by prisoners or other persons relating to personal injury, illness, or other damages resulting from contact with a facility, its managers, personnel or other prisoners, including damages arising from a prisoner's escape from, or a disturbance or riot at, a facility we own or manage, or from the misconduct of our employees. To the extent the events serving as a basis for any potential claims are alleged or determined to constitute illegal or criminal activity, we could also be subject to criminal liability. Such liability could result in significant monetary fines and could affect our ability to bid on future contracts and retain our existing contracts. In addition, as an owner of real property, we may be subject to a variety of proceedings relating to personal injuries of persons at such facilities. The claims against our facilities may be significant and may not be covered by insurance. Even in cases covered by insurance, our deductible (or self-insured retention) may be significant.\nWe are subject to necessary insurance costs.\nWorkers' compensation, auto liability, employee health, and general liability insurance represent significant costs to us. Because we are significantly self-insured for workers' compensation, auto liability, employee health, and general liability risks, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience, our ability to control our claims experience, and in the case of workers' compensation and employee health, rising health care costs in general. Unanticipated additional insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, and the failure to obtain or maintain any necessary insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe may be adversely affected by inflation.\nMany of our facility contracts provide for fixed fees or fees that increase by only small amounts during their terms. If, due to inflation or other causes, our operating expenses, such as wages and salaries of our employees, insurance, medical, and food costs, increase at rates faster than increases, if any, in our revenues, then our profitability would be adversely affected. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Inflation.\"\nTechnological changes or negative changes in the level of acceptance of, or resistance to, the use of electronic monitoring products could cause our electronic monitoring products and other technology to become obsolete or require the redesign of our electronic monitoring products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nTechnological changes within our electronic monitoring business may require us to expend resources in an effort to acquire, maintain and/or utilize new electronic monitoring products and technology. We may not be able to anticipate or respond to technological changes in a timely manner, and our response may not result in successful electronic monitoring product offerings. If we are unable to anticipate or timely respond to technological changes, our business could be adversely affected. Further, our business could be adversely affected if the level of acceptance of or resistance to the use of electronic monitoring products and services by governmental customers were to change over time in a negative manner so that governmental customers decide to decrease their usage levels and contracting for electronic monitoring products and services.\nWe depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply our electronic monitoring products. If our suppliers cannot provide the products or services we require in a timely manner and with such quality as we expect, our ability to market and sell our electronic monitoring products and services could be harmed.\nIf our suppliers fail to supply, in a timely manner, electronic monitoring products that meet our quantity, quality, cost requirements, or technical specifications, we may not be able to access alternative sources of these products within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates. A reduction or interruption in the supply of such products, or a significant increase in the price of such products, (including as a result of the supply chain delays and disruptions currently impacting domestic and global distribution of products as a result of COVID-19), could have an adverse impact on our marketing and sales initiatives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, contracts with such suppliers may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may be subject to costly product liability claims from the use of our electronic monitoring products, which could damage our reputation, impair the marketability of our products and services and force us to pay costs and damages that may not be covered by adequate insurance.\nThe operation of our electronic monitoring products and services entails a risk of product liability. We could be subject to product liability claims to the extent these electronic monitoring products fail to perform as intended. Even unsuccessful claims against us could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation, the diversion of management time and resources, damage to our reputation and impairment of the marketability of our electronic monitoring products and services. While we maintain liability insurance, it is possible that a successful claim could be made against us, that the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim, and that damages payable by us would harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with ownership of real estate.\nOur ownership of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and other government-leased assets subjects us to risks typically associated with investments in real estate. Investments in real estate and, in particular, correctional and detention facilities have limited or no alternative use and thus are relatively illiquid. Therefore, our ability to divest ourselves of one or more of our facilities promptly in response to changing conditions is limited. Investments in real estate properties subject us to risks involving potential exposure to environmental liability and uninsured loss. Our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation. In addition, although we maintain insurance for many types of losses, there are certain types of losses, such as losses from earthquakes and acts of terrorism, which may be either uninsurable or for which it may not be economically feasible to obtain insurance coverage in light of the substantial costs associated with such insurance. As a result, we could lose both our capital invested in, and anticipated profits from, one or more of the properties we own. Further, it is possible to experience losses that may exceed the limits of insurance coverage.\nThe primary risk we face for asset impairment charges is associated with real estate that we own. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.3 billion in property and equipment, including $163.4 million in long-lived assets at eight idled CoreCivic Safety facilities and four idled CoreCivic Community facilities. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure agreements to utilize our idle properties, or that we will not incur impairment charges in the future.\nCertain of our facilities are subject to options to purchase and reversions. Ten of our facilities are subject to an option to purchase by certain governmental agencies. Such options are exercisable by the corresponding contracting governmental entity generally at any time during the term of the respective facility contract. Certain of these purchase options are based on the depreciated book value of the facility, which essentially could result in the transfer of ownership of the facility to the governmental agency at the end of the life used for accounting purposes, while other options to purchase are exercisable at prices below fair market value. See \"Business - Facility Portfolio.\" If any of these options are exercised, there exists the risk that we will be unable to invest the proceeds from the sale of the facility in one or more properties that yield as much cash flow as the property acquired by the government entity. In addition, in the event any of these options is exercised, there exists the risk that the contracting governmental agency will terminate the management contract associated with such facility. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the ten facilities currently subject to these options generated $318.4 million in revenue (17.1% of total revenue) and incurred $242.2 million in operating expenses.\nRisks related to facility construction and development activities may increase our costs related to such activities. When we are engaged to perform construction and design services for a facility, we typically act as the primary contractor and subcontract with other companies that act as the general contractors. As primary contractor, we are subject to the various risks associated with construction (including, without limitation, shortages of labor and materials, work stoppages, labor disputes, and weather interference which could cause construction delays). In addition, we are subject to the risk that the general contractor will be unable to complete construction at the budgeted costs or be unable to fund any excess construction costs, even though we require general contractors to post construction bonds and insurance. Under such contracts, we are ultimately liable for all late delivery penalties and cost overruns.\nWe may be adversely affected by an increase in costs or difficulty of obtaining adequate levels of surety credit on favorable terms.\nWe are often required to post bid or performance bonds issued by a surety company as a condition to bidding on or being awarded a contract. Availability and pricing of these surety commitments are subject to general market and industry conditions, among other factors. Increases in surety costs could adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to effectively pass along such increases to our customers. We cannot assure you that we will have continued access to surety credit or that we will be able to secure bonds economically, without additional collateral, or at the levels required for any potential facility development or contract bids. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of surety credit on favorable terms, we would have to rely upon letters of credit under our Revolving Credit Facility, which could entail higher costs if such borrowing capacity was even available when desired, and our ability to bid for or obtain new contracts could be impaired.\nInterruption, delay or failure of the provision of our technology services or information systems, or the compromise of the security thereof, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nComponents of our business depend significantly on effective information systems and technologies, some of which are provided and/or maintained by third parties. As with all companies that utilize information systems, we are vulnerable to negative impacts to our business if the operation of those systems malfunctions or experiences errors, interruptions or delays, or certain information contained therein is compromised. As a matter of course, we may store or process the personal information of offenders, employees and other persons as required to provide our services and such personal information or other data may be hosted or exchanged with our government partners and other third-party providers. While we employ industry standard administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the integrity and security of personal data we collect or process, despite the security measures we have in place, and any additional measures we may implement in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, human errors, acts of vandalism, or other events. For example, several well-known companies have recently disclosed high-profile security breaches involving sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their company's infrastructure or their customers' data, which were not recognized or detected until after such companies had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures they had in place. Any security breach or event resulting in the interruption, delay or failure of our services or information systems, or the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of personal data or confidential information, including confidential information about our employees, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, result in significant monetary penalties and/or regulatory actions for violation of applicable laws or regulations, disrupt our business and result in significant costs for remedial measures to prevent future occurrences and mitigate past violations, result in lost business, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Although we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nThe growing integration of ESG factors in making investment decisions is relatively new, and frameworks and methods used by investors for assessing ESG policies are not fully developed and vary considerably among the investment community. During 2021, we issued our third ESG report to detail how we attempt to deliver on our service commitment to our government partners and manage our operations responsibly and ethically. These policies and practices, whether it be the standards we set for ourselves or ESG criteria established by third parties, and whether or not we meet such standards, may influence our reputation. For example, the perception held by the general public, our governmental partners, vendors, suppliers, other stakeholders, or the communities in which we do business may depend, in part, on the standards we have chosen to aspire to meet, whether or not we meet these standards on a timely basis or at all, and whether or not we meet external ESG factors they deem relevant. Nonetheless, the subjective nature and wide variety of methods and processes used by various stakeholders, including investors, to assess a company with respect to ESG criteria can result in the perception of negative ESG factors or a misrepresentation of our ESG policies and practices. Our failure to achieve progress on our ESG policies and practices on a timely basis, or at all, or to meet ESG criteria set by third parties, could adversely affect our business, financial performance, or growth.\nBy electing to set and publicly share these ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities. As a result, our reputation could be harmed if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report, such as safety and security, human rights, diversity, quality assurance and facility oversight, community development, and environmental sustainability. Any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these standards or our failure or perceived failure to meet such standards could impact: employee retention; the willingness of our governmental partners, vendors and suppliers to do business with us; investors willingness or ability to purchase or hold our securities; or our ability to access capital, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. Our ESG report is not a part of this Annual Report.\nAs an owner and operator of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities, we are subject to risks relating to acts of God, outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic disease, global climate change, terrorist activity and war.\nWe may encounter staffing constraints as well as costs and expenses associated with owning and/or operating our correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities as a result of acts of God, outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), global climate change (including the potential for increased inclement weather and natural disasters), war (including the potential for war), terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity), political unrest, geopolitical uncertainty and other forms of civil strife, in or around locations where we own and/or operate significant properties. These events could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt securities.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $1,551.9 million. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or certain other business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we may need to reduce capital expenditures, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, obtain additional equity financing or sell assets. We may be unable to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur Credit Agreements, indentures related to our senior notes, and other debt instruments have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility.\nThe indentures related to our 4.625% senior notes due 2023, 8.25% senior notes due 2026, and 4.75% senior notes due 2027, collectively referred to herein as our senior notes, the term loan under our Bank Credit Facility, or Term Loan A, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan B, or our Term Loan B, and, together with the Bank Credit Facility, our Credit Agreements, contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our Bank Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Our Term Loan B requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a secured leverage ratio and, under specified circumstances, a loan-to-value requirement. Our Credit Agreements include other restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations; make asset dispositions, make restricted payments and investments; issue disqualified stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. The indentures related to our senior notes contain limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events, as well as other limitations on our ability to create liens on our assets. The indenture related to our 8.25% senior notes due 2026 additionally limits our ability to incur indebtedness, make restricted payments and investments and prepay certain indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. We do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of our assets.\nSubject to applicable laws and certain agreed-upon exceptions, our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A are secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of CoreCivic's domestic subsidiaries, 65% of the capital stock of CoreCivic\u2019s foreign subsidiaries, all of CoreCivic\u2019s accounts receivable and all of CoreCivic's deposit accounts. Our Term Loan B is secured by a first lien on certain specified real property assets, representing a loan-to-value of no greater than 80%. Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants under our existing indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness secured by existing or future assets of CoreCivic or our subsidiaries. In the event of a default under our Credit Agreements or any other secured indebtedness, or if we experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of our secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only after that would holders of our unsecured debt be entitled to payment from our remaining assets. In such an event, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts due to holders of our unsecured debt, and such holders may receive less than the full amount to which they are entitled.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash or may require us to refinance our indebtedness before it matures. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, or at all.\nCurrently, our Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facility both mature in April 2023. Our Term Loan B matures in December 2024. We also have outstanding $173.7 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% senior notes due 2023, $675.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% senior notes due 2026, and $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due 2027. In addition, we have $154.5 million outstanding under a non-recourse mortgage note with an interest rate of 4.43% maturing in 2040. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe risk exists that our business will be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our existing senior notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including our senior notes, on or before maturity. Our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of\nleverage, the amount of our cash flows, the value of our assets, borrowing and other financial restrictions imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we may be forced to agree to otherwise unfavorable financing terms or to sell one or more properties at unattractive prices or on disadvantageous terms. Any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our cash flows.\nWe are required to repurchase all or a portion of our senior notes upon a change of control, and our Credit Agreements are subject to acceleration upon a change of control.\nUpon certain change of control events, as that term is defined in the indentures for our senior notes, including a change of control caused by an unsolicited third party, we are required to make an offer in cash to repurchase all or any part of each holder's notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal thereof, plus accrued interest. The source of funds for any such repurchase would be our available cash or cash generated from operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of equity or funds provided by a new controlling person or entity. Sufficient funds may not be available to us, however, at the time of any change of control event to repurchase all or a portion of the tendered notes pursuant to this requirement. Our failure to offer to repurchase notes, or to repurchase notes tendered, following a change of control will result in a default under the respective indentures, which could lead to a cross-default under our Credit Agreements and under the terms of our other indebtedness. In addition, terms of our Credit Agreements, which are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of a change in control (as described therein), may prohibit us from making any such required repurchases. Prior to repurchasing the notes upon a change of control event, we must either repay outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Agreements or obtain the consent of the lenders under our Credit Agreements. If we do not obtain the required consents or repay our outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Agreements, we would remain effectively prohibited from offering to repurchase the notes, which would cause a default under the indentures governing the notes.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still incur more debt.\nThe terms of the indentures for our senior notes and our Credit Agreements restrict our ability to incur indebtedness; however, we may nevertheless incur additional indebtedness in the future, and in the future, we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including our Credit Agreements, and may incur additional indebtedness as a result so long as we comply with the limitations in our senior notes and Credit Agreements while they are in effect. As of December 31, 2021, we had $786.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Bank Credit Facility also contains an \"accordion\" feature that provides for uncommitted incremental extensions of credit in the form of increases in the revolving commitments or incremental term loans of up to $350.0 million. In addition, so long as we comply with the limitations in our senior notes and Credit Agreements while they are in effect, we may issue an indeterminate amount of debt securities from time to time when we determine that market conditions and the opportunity to utilize the proceeds from the issuance of such debt securities are favorable. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.\nOur ability to incur more secured debt has been further limited by the Term Loan B.\nThe Term Loan B required us to place liens on mortgaged properties representing a loan-to-value of no greater than 80%. Our Credit Agreements limit the amount of liens we can place on existing assets, further restricting the amount of additional secured debt we are able to obtain. This limitation restricts our ability to obtain financing for future needs and opportunities.\nOur access to capital may be affected by general macroeconomic conditions.\nCredit markets may tighten significantly for various reasons that may or may not result from company-specific activities such that our ability to obtain new capital could be more challenging and more expensive. Further, we can provide no assurance that the banks that have made commitments under our Bank Credit Facility will continue to operate as going concerns in the future or will agree to extend commitments beyond the maturity date. If any of the banks in the lending group were to fail, or fail to renew their commitments, it is possible that the capacity under our Bank Credit Facility would be reduced. In the event that the availability under our Bank Credit Facility was reduced significantly, we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to continue with our business and capital strategies. Our options for addressing such capital constraints would include, but not be limited to (i) delaying certain capital expenditure projects, (ii) obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased or new amounts under the terms of our Bank Credit Facility, (iii) accessing the public capital markets, or (iv) retaining more of our cash flow. Such alternatives could be on terms less favorable than under existing terms, which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIncreasing activist resistance to the use of public-private partnerships for correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities could impact our ability to obtain financing to grow our business or to refinance existing indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur company does not, under longstanding policy, lobby for or against policies or legislation that would determine the basis for, or duration of, an individual's incarceration or detention. This strict policy also applies to external government relations professionals working on our behalf at all levels of government. Nonetheless, contracting for correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities and related services has not achieved complete acceptance by certain governments or the public at large. The operation of correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities by private entities has encountered resistance from certain groups, such as immigration advocates, labor unions, prison reform organizations and other special interest groups that believe correctional, detention, and residential reentry facilities should only be operated by governmental agencies, or that alternatives to immigrant detention should be utilized to enforce the nation's border policies. Further, opposition to immigration, detention and incarceration policies and the association of private companies with the enforcement of such policies have caused some banks, including several that are currently parties to the Bank Credit Facility, to announce that they do not expect to continue providing credit or financial services to private entities that own or operate correctional, and detention facilities, including CoreCivic, or to otherwise participate in the provision of credit or financial services in connection with the development of correctional and detention facilities that are associated with private companies. The banks that are currently parties to the Bank Credit Facility are obligated to honor their commitments under the Bank Credit Facility, which expire in April 2023. These decisions have currently affected the capital markets for our securities, and we can provide no assurance that additional banks that are party to our Bank Credit Facility will not make similar decisions, or that new banks will be willing to become party to our Bank Credit Facility, or that the capital markets for our securities will improve. While we believe we will continue to have access to capital, restrictions on our access to capital, or increases in the cost of capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt.\nWe have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, including indebtedness under our Credit Agreements. Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could have an adverse impact on us and our ability to pay down our debt, return capital to our stockholders and pay maturing debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments.\nRisks Related to our Corporate Tax Structure\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of revoking our REIT election and becoming a taxable C Corporation effective January 1, 2021, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected, if at all, or may not offset the costs of revoking our REIT election and becoming a taxable C Corporation.\nWe believe that revoking our REIT election and becoming a taxable C Corporation, among other things, provides us with greater flexibility to use our free cash flows as we are no longer required to operate under the REIT rules, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. However, the amount of our free cash flows may not meet our expectations, which may reduce, or eliminate, the anticipated benefits of the transition from a REIT to a taxable C Corporation. For example, if our cash flows do not meet our expectations, our ability to implement our new capital allocation strategy may be delayed, and we may not be able to reduce our debt as quickly as we desire. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transition from a REIT to a taxable C Corporation will offset its costs, which could be greater than we expect. Our failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transition from a REIT to a taxable C Corporation at all, or in a timely manner, or a failure of any benefits realized to offset its costs, could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, continued economic and political conditions in the United States could result in changes in U.S. tax laws. The Biden administration has proposed several corporate tax increases, including raising the U.S. corporate income tax rate and a global minimum tax. These proposals include changes to the existing framework in respect of income taxes, as well as new types of non-income taxes which could apply to our business. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form such changes will pass, if enacted into law, they could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, results of operations, cash flows and profitability.\nIf we failed to remain qualified as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status, we would be subject to corporate income taxes and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income for those years.\nWe operated in a manner that was intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes during those years we elected REIT status, 2013 through 2020. However, we cannot assure you that we qualified as a REIT during those years. Qualification as a REIT required us to satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, which may change from time to time and for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, the REIT must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, a REIT is required to distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis.\nIf we failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year we elected REIT status, we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax for years before 2018) on our taxable income computed in the usual manner for corporate taxpayers without deduction for distributions to our stockholders, and we may need to borrow additional funds or issue securities to pay such additional tax liability. Any such corporate income tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes, because, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be taxable as a C Corporation, beginning in the year in which the failure occurred, and we would not be allowed to re-elect to be taxed as a REIT for the following four years.\nEven if we remained qualified as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status, we may owe taxes under certain circumstances.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status, we will be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property, including on taxable income that we did not distribute to our stockholders, and on net income from certain \"prohibited transactions\". In addition, the REIT provisions of the Code are complex and are not always subject to clear interpretation. For example, a REIT must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources, including rents from real property. Rents from real property include amounts received for the use of limited amounts of personal property and for certain services. Whether amounts constitute rents from real property or other qualifying income may not be entirely clear in all cases. We may fail to qualify as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status if we exceed the permissible amounts of non-qualifying income unless such failures qualify for relief under certain statutory relief provisions. Even if we qualify for statutory relief, we may be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more such relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status. Furthermore, we conducted substantial activities through TRSs, and the income of those subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates.\nPerforming services through our TRSs during those years we elected REIT status may increase our overall tax liability or subject us to certain excise taxes. A TRS may hold assets and earn income, including income earned from the performance of correctional services, that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT. During those years we elected REIT status, we conducted a significant portion of our business activities through our TRSs. Our TRSs are subject to federal, foreign, state and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income generally is available for distribution to us but is not required to be distributed to us. The TRS rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs were on arm's-length terms. If it is determined that our arrangements with our TRSs were not on an arm's-length terms, we would be subject to the 100% excise tax.\nThe value of the securities we owned in our TRSs during those years we elected REIT status was limited under the REIT asset tests. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation affected our ability to increase the size of our TRSs' operations and assets during those years that we elected REIT status, and there can be no assurance that we were able to comply with this limitation. If it is determined that we were unable to comply with this limitation, we would fail to qualify as a REIT for those years we elected REIT status.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \"prohibited transactions\" limited our ability to engage in transactions during those years we elected REIT status which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not believe that we held any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business during those years we elected REIT status, unless the sale or disposition qualified under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market price of our equity securities may vary substantially, which may limit our stockholders' ability to liquidate their investment.\nFactors that could affect the market price of our equity securities include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of companies in the corrections, detention, or residential reentry industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in government policy, legislation and regulations that affect utilization of the private sector for corrections, detention, and residential reentry services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022\nissuances of common shares or other securities in the future; and\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic actions.\nThe number of shares of our common stock available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of common stock, or the availability of common stock for future sale, on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, including stock issued under equity compensation plans, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities ranking senior to our common stock or incurrence of debt (including under our Bank Credit Facility) may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we decide to issue debt or equity securities in the future ranking senior to our common stock or otherwise incur indebtedness (including under our Bank Credit Facility), it is possible that these securities or indebtedness will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility and limiting our ability to return capital to our stockholders. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges, including with respect to distributions, more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering or otherwise incur indebtedness will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or financings, any of which could reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute the value of our common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 50.0 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors also has the authority, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any new series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation rights and other preferences superior to our common stock. In the event that we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preferences superior to our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and discourage or prevent a transaction that may be favorable to our stockholders.\nOur charter and bylaws and Maryland law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company.\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, deter, or prevent a change in control of our company or our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes of shares entitled to vote thereon; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Maryland law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions of our charter and bylaws and Maryland law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock, and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85234, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CXW"}
