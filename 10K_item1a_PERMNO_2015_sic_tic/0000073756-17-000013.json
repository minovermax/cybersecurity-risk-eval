The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and the market value of our securities. Investors in our company should consider these matters, in addition to the other information we have provided in this report and the documents we incorporate by reference.\nWe derive most of our revenue from companies in the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.\nWe derive most of our revenue from customers in the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry. The offshore oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Worldwide political, economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Since the general decline in the price of oil from mid 2014, many oil and gas companies made significant reductions in their capital and operating expenditures, which are adversely impacting demand for the services and products provided by our Oilfield business. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in our segments within our Oilfield business. Some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions and industry trends;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels;\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries, including U.S. shale oil;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022\nlaws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntechnological changes;\n\u2022\nthe political environment of oil-producing regions;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of new regulations.\nDuring 2010, the U.S. government established new regulations relating to the design of wells and testing of the integrity of wellbores, the use of drilling fluids, the functionality and testing of well control equipment, including blowout preventers, and other safety and environmental regulations. The U.S. government is requiring that operators demonstrate their compliance with those regulations before commencing deepwater drilling operations. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, the cost or availability of insurance and the impacts of these factors on decisions by customers or other industry participants could further reduce demand for our services, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nOur international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries. These activities accounted for approximately 57% of our consolidated revenue in 2016. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include risks of:\n\u2022\nregional and global economic downturns;\n\u2022\ndisturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange restrictions;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, particularly in countries highly dependent on oil revenue;\n\u2022\nforeign taxation, including the application and interpretation of tax laws;\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate earnings or capital;\n\u2022\nchanging political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanging foreign and domestic monetary policies; and\n\u2022\nsocial, political, military and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflict, terrorist attacks or acts of piracy.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur exposure to the risks we described above varies from country to country. In recent periods, economic conditions, political instability and civil unrest in Africa have been our greatest concerns. There is a risk that a continuation or worsening of these conditions could materially and adversely impact our future business, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Of our total consolidated revenue for 2016, we generated approximately 21% from our operations in Africa, primarily in Angola.\nForeign exchange risks and fluctuations may affect our profitability on certain projects.\nWe operate on a worldwide basis with substantial operations outside the U.S. that subject us to U.S. dollar translation and economic risks. In order to manage some of the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency derivative (hedging) instruments, especially when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. However, these actions may not always eliminate all currency risk exposure, in particular for our long-term contracts. A disruption in the foreign currency markets, including the markets with respect to any particular currencies, could adversely affect our hedging instruments and subject us to additional currency risk exposure. Based on fluctuations in currency, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our contracts globally. Non-U.S. asset and liability balances are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes in U.S. dollars.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThere can be no assurance that the revenues included in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Because of project cancellations or potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers' projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. Material delays, suspensions, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be at greater risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations in the current oil price environment.\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Many of our ROV contracts have 30-day notice termination clauses. Some of the contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. We typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total contract revenues as reflected in our backlog. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nA global financial crisis could impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA recurrence of the credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system that occurred in 2008 and 2009 could have an impact on our business and our financial condition. In particular, the cost of capital increased substantially while the availability of funds from the capital markets diminished significantly. Although the capital markets have recovered, in a recurrence, our ability to access the capital markets in the future could be restricted or be available only on terms we do not consider favorable. Limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our ability to continue our growth strategy. Ultimately, we could be required to reduce our future capital expenditures substantially. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A recurrence of such a global financial crisis could have further impacts on our business that we currently cannot predict or anticipate.\nA global financial crisis or economic recession could have an impact on our suppliers and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations and cash flows.\nIf one or more of the lenders under our revolving credit facility were to become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under that facility, our borrowing capacity could be reduced. Our inability to borrow under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to fund our future operations and growth.\nIn addition, we maintain our cash balances and short-term investments in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located principally in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, and some of those accounts hold deposits that exceed available insurance. It is possible that one or more of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments could become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings. As a result, we could be at risk of not being able to access material amounts of our cash, which could result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations.\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials, as well as the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting and various other applicable laws or regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We operate in some countries that international corruption monitoring groups have identified as having high levels of corruption. Our activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. The precautions we take to prevent and detect misconduct, fraud or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and\nwe could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business strategy contemplates future acquisitions. Acquisitions of other businesses or assets present various risks and uncertainties.\nWe may pursue growth through the acquisition of businesses or assets that will enable us to broaden our service and product offerings and expand into new markets. We may be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable businesses or assets, reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, acquisitions involve various risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties relating to the assimilation of personnel, services and systems of an acquired business and the assimilation of marketing and other operational capabilities;\n\u2022\nchallenges resulting from unanticipated changes in customer and other third-party relationships subsequent to acquisition;\n\u2022\nadditional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition transaction was negotiated;\n\u2022\npossible liabilities under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u2022\npotentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions; and\n\u2022\npotential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms. Moreover, to the extent an acquisition transaction financed by non-equity consideration results in goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on credit availability.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced.\nOur business strategy also includes development and commercialization of new technologies to support our growth. The development and commercialization of new technologies require capital investment and involve various risks and uncertainties.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate by developing and commercializing new service and product offerings. Investments in new technologies involve varying degrees of uncertainties and risk. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the levels of innovation, the development costs and the availability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing technologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of production, distribution and marketing efforts, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new technologies. We may not achieve significant revenues from new service and product investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new services and products may not be profitable, and, even if they are profitable, our operating margins from new services and products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain trained personnel in the future, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenues.\nOur success depends on the continued active participation of our executive officers and key operating personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these persons could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to obtain the proper operational results. As a result, if we should suffer any material loss\nof personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments. Some of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial or other resources than we have. Our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than those of our services and products. This factor is significant to our segments' operations, particularly in the segments within our Oilfield business, where capital investment is critical to our ability to compete.\nWe rely on intellectual property law and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on intellectual property we license from third parties. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or our inability to obtain or renew licenses to use intellectual property of third parties, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products, and our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Our intellectual property could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may be limited or unavailable in some foreign countries where we operate.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or adversely affect our competitive business position. We rely significantly on proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not subject to patent or copyright protection. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors or other parties, as well as through other security measures. These agreements and security measures may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our intellectual property.\nIn some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of third parties. However, it is possible that the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services or products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, or developing non-infringing technologies could materially increase our costs. Additionally, if a license or non-infringing technology were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur information technology systems are subject to interruption and cybersecurity risks that could adversely impact our operations.\nWe continue to evaluate potential replacements or upgrades of existing key information technology systems. The implementation of new information technology systems or upgrades to existing systems subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing or changing these systems, including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks. Our possible new information technology systems implementations or upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated, or at all. In addition, the implementation of new or upgraded information technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations. Any such disruption, and any other information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur operations (both onshore and offshore) are highly dependent on information technology systems. Threats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. In addition, breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our vessels or utilized to operate our ROVs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary information or customer data; disruption of our customers\u2019 operations; loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity incidents. If such a cyber-incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur offshore oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oilfield business. These include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizings and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLaws and governmental regulations may add to our costs or adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is affected by changes in public policy and by federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the offshore oil and gas industry. Offshore oil and gas exploration and production operations are affected by tax, environmental, safety and other laws, by changes in those laws, application or interpretation of existing laws, and changes in related administrative regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our customers or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can increase our costs, and our failure to comply with those laws and regulations can expose us to significant liabilities.\nRisks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of various facilities, and those permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions or both. In some cases, those governmental requirements can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, would result in substantial costs and liabilities. Our insurance policies and the contractual indemnity protection we seek to obtain from our customers may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur internal controls may not be sufficient to achieve all stated goals and objectives.\nOur internal controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. The design of any system of internal controls and procedures is based, in part, on various assumptions about the likelihood of future events. We cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nThe use of estimates could result in future adjustments to our assets, liabilities and results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022\nprovisions relating to the classification, nomination and removal of our directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our shareholders to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nprovisions requiring the approval of the holders of at least 80% of our voting stock for a broad range of business combination transactions with related persons; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.", "PERMNO": 58975, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "OII"}
