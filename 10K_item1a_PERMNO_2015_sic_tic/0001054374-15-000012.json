{"cik": "1054374", "company": "BROADCOM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Broadcom, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our Class A common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter. Variability in the nature of our operating results may be attributed to the factors identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which may be outside our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in the markets we address, including the continuing volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry;\n\u2022\nour dependence on a few significant customers and/or design wins for a substantial portion of our revenue;\n\u2022\nour exit or entry into various markets and our ability to align our resources to areas of strategic focus;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer product needs and market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nseasonality in sales of consumer and enterprise products in which our products are incorporated;\n\u2022\ntiming, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, to manage inventory;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures and other factors such as the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products;\n\u2022\ngoodwill and other purchased intangible impairment charges;\n\u2022\nthe impact of a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, severe weather, tsunami or other flooding, or a nuclear crisis, as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities such as water and electricity, in a key location such as our corporate headquarters or our Northern California facilities, both of which are located near major earthquake fault lines, in our Singapore distribution center or in a key location of one of our suppliers, foundries or customers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of enterprise system failures or network disruptions, the lack of system redundancies, and the potential failure of our disaster recovery planning to cover various unanticipated occurrences; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of tax examinations.\nWe depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers. Contributions to our net revenue by these customers have increased in the last several years. Sales to our five largest customers represented 44.1%, 48.3% and 46.9% of our total net revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Sales to two significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total net revenue, represented 28.2%, 34.6% and 31.9% of our total net revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, as our significant customers become larger relative to our business and the industry, they may be able to leverage pricing pressure through the supply chain, vertical integration or other avenues, thereby adversely affecting our gross margins.\nA significant portion of our revenue in any period may also depend on a single product design win with a large customer. As a result, the loss of any such key design win or any significant delay in the ramp of volume production of the customer\u2019s products into which our product is designed could materially and adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations. We may not be able to maintain sales to certain of our key customers or continue to secure key design wins for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nagreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products; and\n\u2022\nour customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty.\nAdditionally, in markets where we have a strong presence, our future growth will not necessarily be dependent on or correlate to our technical or design win success, but rather, may be dependent on (and may be constrained by) the growth rate of the overall market for the end product devices.\nThe loss of a key customer or design win, a reduction in sales to any key customer, a significant delay or negative development in our customers\u2019 product development plans, or our inability to attract new significant customers or secure new key design wins could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may fail to appropriately adjust our operations in response to changes in our strategy or market demand.\nWe significantly modified the scope of our operations and workforce in recent years. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may from time to time strategically realign our resources. These circumstances could cause the need to implement restructuring actions and other cost saving measures. Our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, such as research and development expenses related to our highly skilled workforce.\nDuring other periods, our growth has placed a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources. To respond to such periods of increased demand, we would need to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, and to upgrade or enhance our existing IT systems. For example, in response to prior periods of growth we began upgrading our enterprise resource planning system and expect to continue to do so during 2015. We may not be successful in implementing new systems, which could involve business disruptions, including impeding the shipment of our products. If we are unable to effectively manage expanding operations during growth periods, we may be unable to adjust our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities.\nAny of these circumstances could materially and adversely affect our current or future business.\nWe face intense competition.\nThe semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase as new markets develop, as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our business. We also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do, and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. We also face competition from newly established competitors, suppliers of products, and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions.\nExisting or new competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality, lower power requirements, lower cost or greater levels of integration. The trend of increasingly integrated SoCs and chipset solutions in particular could pose a risk to various\nlines of our business, especially with respect to our connectivity products, as customers may opt for a solution that includes functionality that was previously sourced from us on a standalone basis.\nIncreased competition also has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenditures on research and development, a decline in average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets. These factors in turn create increased pressure to consolidate. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors. If we do not compete successfully, we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline.\nWe manufacture and sell complex products and may be unable to successfully develop and introduce new products.\nWe expect that a high percentage of our future sales will come from sales of new products. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and sometimes short product life cycles. The markets for some of these products are new to us and may be immature and/or unpredictable. These markets may not develop into profitable opportunities and we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance or commercial success that we had expected. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate our future revenue streams from, or the sustainability of, our new products.\nOur industry is dynamic and we are required to devote significant resources to research and development to remain competitive. Such costs increase with the advancement of technologies and manufacturing in smaller geometry processes, which can adversely affect our operating margin. The development of new silicon devices is highly complex, and due to supply chain cross-dependencies and other issues, we may experience delays in completing the development, production and introduction of our new products. We may choose to discontinue one or more products or product development programs to dedicate more resources to other products. The discontinuation of an existing or planned product may adversely affect our relationship with one or more of our customers and/or cause other negative consequences.\nOur ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets;\n\u2022timely complete and introduce new integrated products;\n\u2022transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries;\n\u2022obtain sufficient foundry capacity (including at smaller geometry processes) and packaging materials;\n\u2022license any desired third party technology or intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products.\nIf we are not able to develop and introduce new products in a cost effective and timely manner, we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have experienced hardware and software defects and bugs associated with the introduction of our highly complex products. If any of our products contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality, security or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products. These problems could interrupt or delay sales and shipments of our products to customers. To alleviate these problems, we may have to divert our resources from other development efforts. In addition, these problems could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including possible claims for consequential damages and/or lost profits. As we transition to manufacturing our products in smaller geometry processes, such as 28 nanometers and below, these risks are enhanced.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our international operations.\nWe currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing, assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the United States. Products shipped to international destinations, primarily in Asia, represented 95.7%, 96.4% and 96.4% of our product revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Substantially all of our products are shipped through our logistical facilities in Singapore. An increasing portion of our product sales is made through international distributors, which increases our exposure to the risks described below. In addition, we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in a number of countries. We intend to continue expanding our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad.\nInternational operations are subject to many inherent risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\nexposure to different business practices and legal and compliance standards;\n\u2022\ncontinuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nnationalization of business and blocking of cash flows;\n\u2022\nlogistical delays or disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxation and tariffs; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations.\nOur international operations are subject to increasingly complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act and equivalent laws in other jurisdictions, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor, or agent will not violate our policies. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could also adversely affect our current or future business.\nEconomic conditions in our primary markets, particularly in Asia, may negatively impact the demand for our products in those geographies. Also, all of our international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies. We anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address.\nWe operate primarily in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns characterized by decreases in product demand, excess customer inventories and accelerated erosion of prices. The semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may affect our ability to ship products. Economic volatility can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities. This unpredictability could cause our customers to reduce spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers and vendors may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. As a result, we may experience growth patterns that are different than the demand for our customers\u2019 products, particularly during\nperiods of high volatility.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery or the impact of such events on our customers, our vendors or us. The combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with challenging macroeconomic conditions and supply chain cross-dependencies could have a compound impact on our business. The impact of market volatility is not limited to revenue but may also affect our gross margins and other financial metrics. Any downturn in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract, retain or motivate key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis, we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans. In that event, we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our recent and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nOur stock price is highly volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014 our Class A common stock has traded at prices as low as $23.25 and as high as $44.33 per share. Fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control.\nIn addition, the market prices of securities of semiconductor and other technology companies have been and remain volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, our financial forecasts, or company presentations, then the market price of our Class A common stock will likely decline. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid. In the past, we, and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities, have been the subject of securities class action litigation.\nDue to the nature of our compensation programs, most of our executive officers sell shares of our common stock periodically, often pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. As a result, sales of shares by our executive officers may not be indicative of their respective opinions of Broadcom\u2019s performance at the time of sale or of our potential future performance. Nonetheless, the market price of our stock may be affected by sales of shares by our executive officers.\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new related interpretations by taxing authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our tax planning strategies could adversely affect our results of operations and could lead to volatility with respect to tax expenses and liabilities from period to period. We are subject to examinations and tax audits. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these audits will not have an adverse effect on our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards, our financial position, or our operating results.\nWe may be required to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of others and/or may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights.\nCompanies in the semiconductor industry, particularly those in the wired and wireless communications markets, aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive notices from competitors and other operating companies, as well as notices from \u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d or NPEs, that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. We may also be required to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused another party\u2019s proprietary rights. We have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them. Additionally, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages.\nFurthermore, our success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes, or confidential employee, customer or supplier data. Any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We engage in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, including our customers. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners and control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology without our authorization. If we cannot adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.\nIntellectual property litigation can be expensive, time consuming and distracting to management. An adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or could prevent us from enforcing our intellectual property rights. Settlements can involve royalty or other payments that could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, identifying unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. The initiation of litigation may adversely affect our relationships and agreements with certain customers that have a stake in the outcome of the litigation proceedings.\nWe face risks associated with our acquisition strategy.\nAn important element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products or technologies. The expansion of our business through acquisitions allows us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce and/or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify or consummate future acquisitions or realize the desired benefit from these acquisitions.\nWe face a number of challenges associated with our acquisition strategy that could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management team, including:\n\u2022\nlower revenue, gross margins and operating income than originally anticipated at the time of acquisition and other financial challenges;\n\u2022\ndelays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company\u2019s technologies and/or launch of products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchallenges in obtaining necessary transition services; and\n\u2022\nbecoming subject to intellectual property or other litigation.\nAcquisitions can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities. While we believe we will be able to service any additional debt issued in connection with acquisitions, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. Acquisitions can also result in adverse tax consequences, warranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, write up of acquired inventory to fair value, and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, all of which can adversely affect our reported results on a GAAP basis. Furthermore, we have in the past and may in the future record goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties.\nIt is difficult to accurately predict demand for our semiconductor products. We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Customers can generally cancel, change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand is further impaired by delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle. We operate in a dynamic industry and use significant resources to develop new products for existing and new markets. After we have developed a product, there is no guarantee that our customers will integrate our product into their equipment or devices and, ultimately, bring those equipment and devices incorporating our product to market. In these situations, we may never produce or deliver a significant number of our products, even after incurring substantial development expenses. From the time a customer elects to integrate our solution into their product, it is typically six to 24 months before high volume production of that product commences. After volume production begins, we cannot be assured that the equipment or devices incorporating our product will gain market acceptance.\nOur products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, creating supply chain cross-dependencies. Accordingly, supply chain disruptions affecting components of our customers\u2019 devices and/or systems could negatively impact the demand for our products, even if the supply of our products is not directly affected.\nOur product demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. In the event we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell. As a result, we could hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we could forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Also, due to our industry\u2019s use of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory management, any disruption in the supply chain could lead to more immediate shortages in product or component supply. Additionally, any enterprise system failures, including in connection with implementing new systems, could impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes.\nA portion of our inventory is maintained under hubbing and distribution arrangements whereby products are delivered to a customer or third party warehouse based upon the customer\u2019s projected needs. Under these arrangements, we do not recognize product revenue until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products. Our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired under such arrangements, which could increase expenses associated with insurance costs, excess and obsolete product inventory and negatively impact our cash flow.\nWe depend on third parties to fabricate, assemble and test our products.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we do not own or operate fabrication, assembly or test facilities. As a result, we face competition for manufacturing capacity in the open market. We rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test substantially all of our semiconductor devices. Accordingly, we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance. This lack of control could result in product shortages or quality assurance problems. These issues could delay shipments of our products or increase our assembly or testing costs. In\naddition, the consolidation of foundry subcontractors, as well as the increasing capital intensity and complexity associated with fabrication in smaller process geometries has limited our diversity of suppliers and increased our risk of a \u201csingle point of failure.\u201d Specifically, as we move to smaller geometries, we have become increasingly reliant on TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) for the manufacture of product at and below 40 nanometers. The lack of diversity of suppliers could also drive increased wafer prices, adversely affect our results of operations, including our gross margins.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with any of our direct or indirect suppliers, including our manufacturing, assembly or test subcontractors. We typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis. In the event our third-party foundry subcontractors experience a disruption or limitation of manufacturing, assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative manufacturing, assembly and testing services in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, our foundries must have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process, which could be time-consuming. We could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative manufacturers, assemblers or testers for our products. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.\nBecause we rely on outside foundries and other third party suppliers, we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above, including:\n\u2022\na lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;\n\u2022\nthe limited availability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and\n\u2022\nthe location of foundries and other suppliers in regions that are subject to earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters.\nThe manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process. Our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields. This often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start-up of new process technologies. In addition, we are dependent on our foundry subcontractors to successfully transition to smaller geometry processes.\nOur systems are subject to security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\nWe experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, and as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our computer systems and networks. Such cyber attacks could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in significant loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of significant proprietary information, it could cause damage to our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and ultimately harm our business.\nGovernment regulation may adversely affect our business.\nThe effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business. For example, regulatory policies of the Federal Communications Commission that affect the ability of cable or satellite operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers could impede sales of our products in the United States. We and our customers are also subject to various import and export laws and regulations that apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. If we fail to continue to comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines.\nAs described above under the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are exposed to risks associated with our international operations,\u201d our business is also increasingly subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act and\nequivalent laws in other jurisdictions, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws, among others. Foreign governments may also impose tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non-domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally. These tariffs, duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For instance, the SEC requires disclosures relating to the sourcing of certain minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Those rules, or similar rules that may be adopted in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.\nOur future ability to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases may be impacted by the availability of U.S. cash.\nGiven that the majority of our cash is generated overseas, we may be limited in our ability to consistently increase or maintain the level of capital return in the form of dividends or share repurchases. In January 2010, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which Broadcom would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock. From 2011 through 2014 and again in 2015 our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend payment. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend payment or declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\nOur Board has also approved various share repurchase programs, including a program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1 billion in 2015.\nFuture dividends and the amount of share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u2022\nuse of cash to consummate various transactions;\n\u2022\nour views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development;\n\u2022\nchanges in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and\n\u2022\nchanges to our business model.\nA reduction in our dividend payments or amount of shares repurchased could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. For example, our Board of Directors may issue shares of Class B common stock in connection with certain acquisitions, which shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote (as compared to one vote per share in the case of our Class A common stock). Furthermore, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue shares of common or preferred stock without a shareholder vote. These provisions, among others, may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control.\nOur co-founders and their affiliates may strongly influence the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014 our co-founders, directors, executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned 8.8% of our outstanding common stock and held 47.3% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. As a result, the voting power of these shareholders may strongly influence the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders, including the election of our Board of Directors and certain significant corporate transactions. In particular, as of December 31, 2014 our two founders, Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III and\nDr. Henry Samueli, beneficially owned a total of 8.2% of our outstanding common stock and held 47.0% of the total voting power held by our shareholders. Because of their significant voting stock ownership, we may not be able to engage in certain transactions, and our shareholders may not be able to effect certain actions or transactions, without the approval of one or both of these shareholders. In addition, repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock under our share repurchase program would result in an increase in the total voting power of our co-founders, directors, executive officers and their affiliates, as well as other continuing shareholders.", "PERMNO": 85963, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "BRCM"}
