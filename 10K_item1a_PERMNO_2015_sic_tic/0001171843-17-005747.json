RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, information concerning our possible future consolidated results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, our competitive position and the effects of competition, regulatory actions and economic conditions. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by forward-looking words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from such forward-looking statements are included in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this report. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they were made.\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that the Company currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also affect the Company\u2019s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.\nIndustry Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial results are subject to general business and economic conditions. The economic downturn and slow recovery reduced demand for financing capital assets. Continued or renewed weakness in the economy or in certain sectors could impact the financial performance and condition of customers and negatively affect the repayment of their obligations. In addition, changes in securities markets and monetary fluctuations adversely affect the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Company\u2019s liquidity needs.\nChanges in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce the Company\u2019s net finance and interest income. The Company\u2019s net finance and interest income, which is the difference between income earned on leases, loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits, is affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Since December 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC) of the FRB has increased short term interest rates three times from the near zero level maintained for several years, but the timing and amount of any further increases is unclear. Increases in interest rates will increase the income earned on the Company\u2019s available cash balances, but will also increase the Bank\u2019s cost of funds over time. If the interest rates on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on leases, loans, securities and other interest-earning investments, net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected.\nCalifornia First National Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nUncertain worldwide economic conditions and volatility in the currency and credit markets may negatively impact the Company and its customers. The Company\u2019s net interest income is impacted by changes in market rates of interest, changes in credit spreads, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types may lag behind. The result of these changes to rates may cause differing spreads on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and a narrowing of the spread between longer and shorter term rates tends to negatively impact net interest margins. Although the Bank employs a funding strategy designed to correlate the repricing characteristics of assets with liabilities, the impact of interest rate movements and customer demand is not always consistent during different market cycles, and changes in the costs for deposits and yields on assets may not coincide. Foreign currency fluctuations have hurt the results of many businesses, including certain leveraged loan customers, and may impact their ability to meet their obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, and charge-offs, but require increases to the allowance for credit losses which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business, and financial condition.\nChanges in the laws, regulations and policies governing financial services companies could alter the Company\u2019s business environment and adversely affect operations. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part the Company\u2019s cost of funds and the return that can be earned on leases, loans and investments, which affect the Company\u2019s net finance, loan and interest income.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations established by government entities. Most regulation is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Bank regulators can impose restrictions on the ability of the Company to undertake certain business and growth initiatives. Following the 2008 financial crisis, regulators increased their oversight of banks and have taken a more active role in imposing restrictions on bank loan operations, the classification of assets and determination of the allowance for credit losses. Changes in laws or governmental regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, have impacted the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot predict whether any additional legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nCyber security and privacy breaches may hurt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. Our systems and networks store all the Company\u2019s business records as well as personal information about our customers and employees. We have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information. However, there is still a risk that the security systems and infrastructure that we maintain may not be successful in protecting against all security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, and cyber-attacks. Efforts have accelerated in recent months by parties seeking to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems. Techniques change frequently and often are not recognized until launched and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Third parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure or outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers' data. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, the loss of business, litigation, regulatory investigations, and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, credit unions and investment companies, many of which have greater resources than the Company.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nCalifornia First National Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nCompany Risk Factors\nRegulatory restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to originate syndicated commercial loans may not be rescinded which could have a long term negative impact on the Company. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the OCC directed the Bank to cease originating new syndicated commercial loans and to take action to substantially reduce its concentration of leveraged loans. At March 31, 2017, $366.9 million, or 97% of the commercial loan portfolio consisted of participations in syndicated transactions, with approximately $248.1 million, or 65%, characterized as \u201cleveraged loans\u201d under guidance promulgated by federal bank regulators. Consequently, in order to comply with the OCC directive, the net commercial loan portfolio declined by 18% during the 2017 fourth quarter to $306 million at June 30, 2017, and is down 24% from $404 million at June 30, 2016. Syndicated loans have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s growth over the past few years. If regulatory restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to originate syndicated commercial loans are not lifted, it is expected that this will require further significant reductions in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio over the next twelve months, and this will have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to grow its business and net interest income. See \u201cRecent Events\u201d.\nThe Bank is subject to increased liquidity and interest rate risk as it is forced to reduce its loan portfolio. While the Bank believes it can reduce the loan portfolio in an orderly way so as to coordinate the decline with a reduction in deposits and other funding liabilities, consistent with a prudent asset and liability management strategy, this process is complicated and management is not able to perfectly balance loan repayments with deposit withdrawals. As a result, higher yielding loans have paid off before higher cost deposits used to fund those loans have matured.\nThe Bank\u2019s steps to reduce deposits by drastically cutting rates offered on CDs may have a long term negative effect on the Bank\u2019s ability to raise deposits in the future. CalFirst Bank represents 94% of the Company\u2019s assets and bank deposits exceeded $468 million, or 239% of stockholders\u2019 equity at June 30, 2017. After the Bank eliminates the excess deposits, it will need to retain some portion of its deposit base to fund the remaining portfolio. If the remaining deposits do not roll over, or previous customers do not return, CalFirst Bank may be required to seek other sources of funds, including more expensive time deposits and borrowings, or sell more assets. Depending on market conditions, rates paid on deposits and borrowings may be higher than currently paid or no longer available.\nThe Bank and Company continue to be subject to periodic examination by the FRB and the OCC and if the Bank were found to be operating in an unsound or unsafe manner, or in violation of any OCC directive, they could impose new or additional restrictions or requirements, including, but not limited to activity or growth limitations, dividend restrictions, increased loan and lease loss reserve requirements, or other restrictions that could have an adverse effect on the Bank or the Company.\nMarket for capital asset lease financing continues to show weak demand with competitive pricing. The Company\u2019s volume of new lease originations in fiscal 2017 was down for the third year in a row, and the Company does not see signs of significant improvement in lease origination in the near future.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries retain approximately 90% of lease transactions and all loans in their own portfolios, which expose the Company to credit risk. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for probable and estimable losses in the portfolio. The Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses is based on its historical experience as well as industry data, an evaluation of the risks associated with its portfolios, including the size and composition of the lease and loan portfolios, current economic conditions and concentrations within the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or the financial markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, or if the reserve for credit losses is not adequate, future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect financial results.\nThe Company may suffer losses in its lease and loan portfolio despite its underwriting practices. The Company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its lease and loan portfolio by adhering to specific credit practices. Although the Company believes that its criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of leases and loans it makes, the Company may incur losses on leases and loans that meet these criteria.\nLarger transactions and customer concentration may increase the risk of loss in the event of the deterioration of one of these customers or industries. At June 30, 2017, leases aggregating to $17.6 million to one customer accounted for 3.5% of the Company\u2019s net investment in leases and loans, with the ten largest customers representing 22% of the portfolio. Only one industry classification represented over 5% of the Company\u2019s total investment in leases and loans, as public and private colleges and universities aggregated to 6.1%.\nCalifornia First National Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial loan initiative may increase the Company\u2019s risk of losses. The commercial loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans with relatively larger balances than the average lease. About 62% of the portfolio consists of \u201cleveraged loans\u201d as characterized by federal regulatory guidelines, with 15% of the commercial loan portfolio considered to be higher risk leveraged loans by the Company. Based on the OCC directive to not extend the term of loans and reduce the concentration of leveraged loans, the Bank\u2019s loans are steadily being paid off, which in some cases might be for an amount less than the Bank\u2019s carrying cost. No loan credit is rated substandard, but the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s diversification into broader investment alternatives may increase the Company\u2019s risk of losses. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio includes U.S. Treasury and Agency Securities, corporate and municipal bonds and closed-end mutual funds, equity securities, in addition to interest-earning deposits, short-term money market securities and federal funds. These securities subject the Company to increased risk of volatility in the valuation of the investment, as well as greater interest and market risks. The deterioration of one or a few of these investments on a permanent basis could result in an determination that the investment has been permanently impaired and require a write-down of such investment, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe change in residual value of leased assets may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. A portion of the Company\u2019s leases is subject to the risk that the residual value of the property under lease will be less than the Company\u2019s recorded value. Adverse changes in the residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The risk of changes in the realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded residual values depends on many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control.\nThe financial services business involves significant operational risks. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and failure of business continuation and disaster recovery plans. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.\nQuarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Operating results may differ from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including the volume and profitability of leased property being remarketed, the size and credit quality of the lease and loan portfolio, the interest rate environment, the volume of new lease and loan originations, including variations in the property mix and funding of such originations and economic conditions in general. The results of any quarter may not be indicative of results in the future.\nNegative publicity could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial results. Reputation risk, or the risk to the Company\u2019s business from negative publicity, including recent disclosure related to the OCC\u2019s directive to the Bank, is inherent in the Company\u2019s business. Negative publicity can result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including leasing practices, compliance with bank regulations, corporate governance, and actions taken by government regulators in response to those activities. Negative publicity can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to keep and attract customers and deposits and can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action.\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial results are subject to certain assumptions and estimates and management\u2019s selection of accounting method. The Company\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management may select an accounting policy which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the Company\u2019s reporting different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the estimate of residual values, the allowance for credit losses, and income taxes. For more information, refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nCalifornia First National Bancorp and Subsidiaries\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Recently, FASB approved new accounting standards related to the accounting for leases and allowance for credit losses that could change the Company\u2019s financial statements when implemented. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the Company\u2019s restating prior period financial statements.\nLoss of certain key officers would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2018s business and operating results are substantially dependent on certain key employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer of the Bank and certain key sales managers. The loss of the services of these individuals, particularly the Chief Executive Officer, would have a negative impact on the business because of their expertise and years of industry experience.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if the Company fails to attract and retain qualified people. The Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for personnel in most activities the Company engages in can be intense. The Company may not be able to hire the best people or to keep them.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure. Third party vendors provide certain components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure, such as the Bank\u2019s core processing and electronic banking systems, item processing, and Internet connections. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties not providing the Company their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to the Company\u2019s customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nA natural disaster could harm the Company\u2019s business. Natural disasters could harm the Company\u2019s operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of the Company\u2019s websites, which would prevent the Company from gathering deposits, originating leases and loans and processing and controlling its flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and the Company\u2019s operational, financial and management information systems.\nThe Company faces systems failure risks as well as security risks, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d The computer systems and network infrastructure the Company and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication failure. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our computer systems and network infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft.\nThe Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity needs. The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from CalFirst Leasing and the Bank. The principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s stock is from distributions from the subsidiaries. Various regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price can be volatile. The Company\u2019s common stock is not widely held and the limited trading market for the stock can result in fluctuations in prices between trades and make it difficult for stockholders to dispose of their shares. The Company\u2019s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results and dividend policy; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, and changes in government regulations. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, including terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could also cause the Company\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined by NASDAQ, with 63% of the stock held by the Chief Executive Officer, 76% held by two senior executives and fewer than 100 shareholders of record. As a result, senior management has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Company\u2019s policies and business, and determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. These actions may include, for example, the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to corporate documents, the approval of mergers, sales of assets and the continuation of the Company as a registered company with obligations to file periodic reports and other filings with the SEC.\nThe Company is eligible to delist its common stock from NASDAQ and deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act. As a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Company incurs costs and time to comply with these requirements and given the limited public float and trading volume in the Company\u2019s stock, the benefits from continuing as a SEC reporting company may not be supported. The Company is eligible to voluntarily delist its common stock from trading on NASDAQ and, as a bank holding company with fewer than 1,200 stockholders of record, the Company is also eligible to deregister its common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. If the Company takes such actions and the Company\u2019s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act are also suspended, the Company\u2019s common stock would not continue to be traded on NASDAQ and the Company\u2019s reporting obligations with the SEC would cease. While the Company\u2019s common stock could continue to be traded over-the-counter, including through an over-the-counter market such as the OTCQB or OTCQX if elected by the Company, there can be no assurance that this won\u2019t have an adverse effect on the price of the common stock or that an active trading market will continue to exist. If an active trading market is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock may be adversely affected. Further, upon suspension of the Company\u2019s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, significantly less information about the Company may be publicly available, which could also have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nCalifornia First National Bancorp and Subsidiaries", "PERMNO": 11246, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "CFNB"}
