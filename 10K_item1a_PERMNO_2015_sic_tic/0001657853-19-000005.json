{"cik": "1657853", "company": "HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below and should be carefully considered along with all of the information in this 2018 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face in our operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in Hertz Global's common stock or The Hertz Corporation's debt securities. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow and we believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting Hertz Global and Hertz; however, the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly impact us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nOur vehicle rental business is particularly sensitive to reductions in the levels of airline passenger travel, and reductions in air travel could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe vehicle rental industry is particularly affected by reductions in business and leisure travel, especially with respect to levels of airline passenger traffic. Reductions in levels of air travel, whether caused by general economic conditions, airfare increases (e.g., capacity reductions or increases in fuel costs borne by commercial airlines) or other events (e.g., work stoppages, military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural disasters, epidemic diseases, or the response of governments to any of these events) could materially adversely affect us. In particular, we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues from key leisure destinations, including Florida, Hawaii, California, New York and Texas in the U.S. and Europe internationally and the level of travel to these destinations is dependent upon the ability and willingness\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nof consumers to travel on vacation and the effect of economic cycles on consumers\u2019 discretionary travel. To the extent travel to these destinations is adversely affected, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices.\nWe believe that price is one of the primary competitive factors in the vehicle rental market and that technology has enabled cost-conscious customers, including business travelers, to more easily compare rates available from rental companies. We utilize a revenue and pricing optimization strategy that is designed to leverage analytical techniques to maximize total contribution margin across our pricing and fleet decisions, continuously evaluate whether the pricing models are yielding the desired outcomes and provide the right balance between strategic growth goals and achieving desired margins. If we try to increase our pricing, our competitors, some of whom may have greater resources and better access to capital than us, may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing. In addition, our competitors may reduce prices in order to, among other things, attempt to gain a competitive advantage, capture market share or compensate for declines in rental activity. To the extent we do not react appropriately to our competition, our revenues and results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - U.S. and International Rental Car Segments - Markets and Competition\u201d in this 2018 Annual Report.\nOur business is highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain significant components of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, including minimum concession fees, real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs. Seasonal changes in our revenues do not affect those fixed expenses, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher. The second and third quarters of the year have historically been the strongest quarters for our vehicle rental business due to increased levels of leisure travel. We control certain of our costs, including fleet arrangements and availability, to manage seasonal variations in demand. Any circumstance, occurrence or situation that disrupts rental activity during these critical periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to a significant change in revenue.\nIf our management is unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and adjust the number, location and mix of vehicles used in our rental operations accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could suffer.\nVehicle costs typically represent our largest expense and vehicle purchases are typically made weeks or months in advance of the expected use of the vehicle. Accordingly, our business is dependent upon the ability of our management to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and consumer preferences with respect to the mix of vehicles used in our rental operations and the location of those vehicles. To the extent we do not purchase a sufficient number of vehicles, or the right types of vehicles, to meet consumer demand, we may lose revenue or market share to our competitors. If we purchase too many vehicles, our Vehicle Utilization could be adversely affected and we may not be able to dispose of excess vehicles in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our failure to utilize a flexible and systematic process for fleet management that accurately estimates future levels of rental activity and determines the appropriate mix of vehicles used in our rental operations may result in obsolescence and excessive aging of fleet, the inability to sell fleet at adequate prices, inefficient fleet utilization, increased fleet costs, lower customer satisfaction, and other unfavorable consequences which may materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIncreased vehicle cost due to declines in the value of the non-program vehicles in our operations could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturers agree to repurchase program vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during a specified time period. For non-program vehicles in our rental operations, we have an increased risk that the net amount realized upon the disposition of the vehicle will be less than its estimated residual value at such time. Any decrease in residual values of our non-program vehicles could result in a substantial loss on the sale of such\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nvehicles or accelerated depreciation while we own the vehicles, which can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWhile program vehicles cost more than comparable non-program vehicles, the use of program vehicles enables us to forecast our depreciation expense with more precision, which is useful because depreciation is a significant cost in our operations. Using program vehicles is also useful in managing our seasonal peak demand for vehicles, because in certain cases we can sell certain program vehicles shortly after having acquired them at a higher value than what we could for a similar non-program vehicle at that time. If there were fewer program vehicles in our rental operations, these benefits would diminish and we would bear increased risk related to residual value. In addition, the related depreciation on our vehicles and our flexibility to reduce the number of vehicles used in our rental operations by returning vehicles sooner than originally expected without the risk of loss in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand would be reduced.\nWe may fail to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer demands.\nOur industry has recently been characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer demands. For example, industry participants have taken advantage of new technologies to improve Vehicle Utilization, decrease customer wait times and improve customer satisfaction. Our industry has also seen the entry of new competitors, including TNCs, whose businesses are based on emerging mobile platforms and efforts to introduce various types of autonomous vehicles. Our ability to continually improve our current processes and products in response to changes in technology is essential in maintaining our competitive position and current levels of customer satisfaction. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced product offerings. A failure to have a systematic and comprehensive process related to emerging or disruptive competitors or technology may result in loss of competitive differentiation, margin erosion, departure of key partners, declining market share, inability to achieve growth targets, and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced vehicles and the cost of the vehicles we purchase increases, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur vehicle purchase strategies can be affected by commercial, economic, market and other conditions. For example, certain vehicle manufacturers have from time to time utilized strategies to reduce sales to the vehicle rental industry, which can negatively affect our ability to obtain vehicles on competitive terms and conditions. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of vehicles, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms during the acquisition of vehicles and are unable to recover from the increased costs, then our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe recognition of previously-deferred tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles may not be fully offset by full expensing of newly-purchased revenue earning vehicles.\nThe recognition of previously-deferred tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles may not be fully offset by full expensing of newly-purchased revenue earning vehicles. A material and extended reduction in vehicle purchases by our U.S. vehicle rental business and Donlen, for any reason, could require us to make material cash payments for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities. We cannot offer assurance that allowances for the full expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles in the future will exceed previously deferred tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under the like-kind exchange (\"LKE\") program.\nBeginning in 2018, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") eliminated the deferral of tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under our LKE program. While we expect that additional deductions provided by the TCJA for 100% expensing of vehicles purchased after September 27, 2017 and placed in service before December 31, 2022 could offset the previously-deferred tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under the LKE program, we can offer no assurance that these deductions will fully offset tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIn addition, the TCJA lowers the 100% expensing by 20% per year beginning in 2023, fully eliminating the expensing by 2027. This change could result in the Company being required to make future material cash tax payments on the sales of revenue earning vehicles. We cannot predict if or when legislation would be enacted in the future to allow full or partial expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles or to allow deferral of tax gains on the dispositions of revenue earning vehicles. If such legislation is not adopted, then our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe failure of a manufacturer of our program vehicles to fulfill its obligations under a repurchase or guaranteed depreciation program could expose us to losses on those program vehicles.\nIf any manufacturer of our program vehicles does not fulfill its obligations under its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreement with us, whether due to default, reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, then we would have to dispose of those program vehicles without receiving the benefits of the associated repurchase programs. In addition, we could be left with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with respect to program vehicles that were sold and returned to the manufacturer but not paid for, or that were sold for less than their agreed repurchase price or guaranteed value.\nThe failure by a manufacturer to pay such amounts could cause a credit enhancement deficiency under our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements, requiring us to either reduce the outstanding principal amount of debt or provide more collateral (in the form of cash, vehicles and/or certain other contractual rights) to the creditors under any such affected arrangement.\nIf one or more manufacturers were to adversely modify or eliminate repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs in the future, our access to and the terms of asset-backed and asset-based debt financing could be adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business.\nThe Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2015 prohibits us from renting vehicles with open federal safety recalls and requires us to repair or address these recalls prior to renting or selling the vehicle. Any federal safety recall would require us to cease renting recalled vehicles until we can react to the recall. If a large number of vehicles are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply, we may not be able to rent recalled vehicles for a significant period of time. These types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles, and could also result in the loss of business to our competitors. Depending on the severity of any recall, it could materially adversely affect, among other things, our revenues, create customer service problems, present liability claims, reduce the residual value of the recalled vehicles and harm our general reputation.\nA business continuity plan is necessary for our global business.\nWe have a business continuity plan designed to (i) identify key assets, operations and underlying threats, (ii) define and assess relevant threats (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, etc.) on business operations, (iii) develop and categorize action plans to minimize the impact of the identified threats and (iv) test the adequacy of our action plans. If our business continuity plan fails to operate as intended, we may experience significant business disruptions, increased litigation and liabilities, product and service quality failures, irreparable harm to customer relationships and other unfavorable consequences which may affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels for a significant amount of our revenues.\nThird-party distribution channels account for a significant amount of our vehicle rental reservations. These third-party distribution channels include traditional and online travel agencies, third-party internet sites, airlines and hotel companies, marketing partners such as credit card companies and membership organizations and global distribution\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nsystems that allow travel agents, travel service providers and customers to connect directly to our reservations systems. Loss of access to any of these channels, changes in pricing or commission structures or a reduction in transaction volume could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, particularly if our customers are unable to access our reservation systems through alternate channels.\nIf our customers develop loyalty to travel intermediaries rather than our brands, our financial results may suffer.\nCertain internet travel intermediaries use generic indicators of the type of vehicle (such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201ccompact\u201d) at the expense of brand identification and some intermediaries have launched their own loyalty programs to develop loyalties to their reservation system rather than to our brands. If the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, our business and revenues could be affected. Additionally, if our market share suffers due to lower levels of customer loyalty, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our annual revenues are generated outside the U.S. Operating in many different countries exposes us to varying risks, which include: (i) multiple, and sometimes conflicting, foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are subject to change and are often much different than the domestic laws in the U.S., including laws relating to taxes, automobile-related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, cost and fee recovery, and the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property; (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation risk, as well as limitations on our ability to repatriate income; (iii) varying tax regimes, including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws and our ability to repatriate cash from non-U.S. affiliates without adverse tax consequences; (iv) local ownership or investment requirements, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (v) political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism. The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur international operations are based in Uxbridge, England and we have significant vehicle rental operations in the United Kingdom and the Eurozone. The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority voted for the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (the \u201cBrexit\u201d). In order to facilitate the Brexit, a process of negotiation will determine the future terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union. Depending on the terms of Brexit, if any, the United Kingdom could lose access to the single European Union market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members. The effects of the Brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect business activity and economic and market conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone and globally, could make it more difficult for us to manage our international operations out of the United Kingdom and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal and economic instability in the European Union.\nOur global business requires a compliance program to promote organizational adherence to applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have a compliance program designed to (i) identify applicable anti-bribery requirements (e.g., laws limiting commercial bribery and corruption), (ii) identify applicable anti-trust requirements (e.g., laws to prevent price fixing, contract rigging, market or customer allocations, etc.), (iii) interpret the application of such requirements, (iv) educate target audiences and (v) provide independent, ongoing compliance monitoring.\nAdditionally, our operations in many different countries increases the risk of a violation, or alleged violation, of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, the economic sanction programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the anti-boycott regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance. The failure of our program to operate as designed, can result in a failure to comply with applicable laws,\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nwhich could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will comply with the Company\u2019s policies that mandate compliance with these laws. Violations of these laws could result in legal and regulatory sanctions, increased litigation and fines and legal expense, prolonged negative publicity, diminished investor confidence, declining employee morale and other unfavorable consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized information technology systems and the concentration of our systems creates risks for us.\nWe rely heavily on communication networks and information technology systems to, among other things, accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our pricing, manage our revenue earning vehicles, manage our financing arrangements, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business. Our reliance on these networks and systems exposes us to various risks that could cause a loss of reservations, interfere with our ability to manage our vehicles, delay or disrupt rental and sales processes, adversely affect our ability to comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our major information technology systems, reservations and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations worldwide. Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of these services, whether as the result of localized conditions (such as a fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as an earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and information technology functions or by eliminating access to financing arrangements. Any disruption or poor performance of our systems could lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information technology networks could adversely affect us.\nWe are continuously evaluating, upgrading and consolidating our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our information technology services. These types of activities subject us to additional costs and inherent risks associated with outsourcing, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to manage our business, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, potential delays or disruptions from upgrading and consolidating our systems and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to outsourcing alternatives, new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems. We are also considering alternatives regarding one of our two U.S.-based data centers as part of the upgrade to our information technology network in response to the expiration of the applicable lease. One alternative may be locating substantially all of our data center operations in a single location, where any loss or damage to that facility could result in operation disruption and data loss. Further, failure to have a comprehensive technology plan and effective process may result in an inability to support business growth expectations and successfully execute information technology business programs and initiatives, cost overruns and excessive write-offs, missed business objectives, program delays and business disruptions, service quality issues, regulatory violations, potential litigation, loss of key talent and other unfavorable consequences. In addition, the implementation of our technology initiatives and systems may cause disruptions in our business operations by severely degrading performance or a complete loss of service and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated and our competitive position may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain systems that allow us to manage our business in a competitive manner.\nThe misuse or theft of information we possess, including as a result of cyber security breaches, could harm our brand, reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities.\nWe regularly possess, process, store and handle non-public information about millions of individuals and businesses, including both credit and debit card information and other sensitive and confidential personal information in the normal course of our business. In addition, our customers regularly transmit sensitive and confidential information to us via the internet and through other electronic means. Despite the security measures and compliance programs we currently\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nmaintain and continuously monitor, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our facilities or systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, misrepresentation, or other forms of deception of our employees or contractors. Many of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, including viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, are difficult to anticipate until launched against a target and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. The failure of our information facilities and systems to perform as designed, or the failure to maintain and protect the security of data, whether as the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could substantially harm our reputation, diminish customer confidence, loss of key customers, interrupt our operations, result in governmental investigations and give rise to civil or criminal liabilities. For example, in recent years many companies have been subject to high-profile security breaches that involved sophisticated and targeted attacks on the company\u2019s infrastructure and the compromise of non-public sensitive and confidential information. These attacks were often not recognized or detected until after the disclosure of sensitive information notwithstanding the preventive and anticipative measures the companies had maintained. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results.\nCyber security threats in our business environment expose us to risks.\nDue to our continuous exposure to cyber-attacks and other security threats, we regularly, and at least quarterly, assess and review our information infrastructure and cyber security framework to assess security threats that could compromise the integrity of our information technology assets and supported business operations. We also regularly define information security objectives and standards and define and monitor identity management and access control. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information infrastructure and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology assets are becoming more sophisticated. We actively monitor compliance, including with the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulations, and respond to security breaches and violations by utilizing procedures that provide for controls on detecting and preventing cyber breaches and communicating information to senior personnel and security representatives that we retain. We also address cyber security threats at third-parties that possess, process, store and handle Hertz data and information to mitigate the risk to us. However, because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent all of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident. Any such failure by us to effectively address, enforce and maintain our information infrastructure and cyber security framework may result in substantial harm to our business, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, malicious corruption of date, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines and possible prolonged negative publicity.\nOur leases and vehicle rental concessions expose us to risks.\nWe maintain a substantial network of vehicle rental locations at airports in the U.S. and internationally. Many of these locations are leased and subject to vehicle rental concessions where vehicle rental companies are frequently required to bid periodically for the available locations. If we are unable to continue operating these facilities at their current locations due to the termination of leases or vehicle rental concessions at airports, which comprise a majority of our revenues, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if the costs of these leases increase and we are unable to increase our prices to offset the increased costs, our financial results could suffer.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon the favorable brand recognition that our \u201cHertz\u201d, \u201cDollar\u201d and \u201cThrifty\u201d brand names have in the markets in which they participate. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as marketing and advertising campaigns, may not have their desired effects. In addition, although our licensing partners are subject to contractual requirements to protect our brands, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions and various laws may limit our ability to enforce the terms of these agreements or to terminate the agreements. Any\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ndecline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nMaintaining effective employee retention and talent management is critical to our success.\nWe develop and maintain a talent management strategy that defines current and future talent requirements (e.g., skills, location needs, timing, etc.) based on our strategic direction, outlines coordinated recruiting and development plans across businesses and regions and considers employee mobility, centers of excellence and shared service concepts to optimize resource plans and leverage labor arbitrage. The consequences that may result from a failure of our employee retention and talent management can include an inability to sustain growth strategies due to the lack of required talent, non-competitive cost structures, an inability to encourage innovation and sustain competitive differentiation, declining employee morale and increased attrition.\nWe may face issues with our union employees.\nLabor contracts covering the terms of employment for the Company's union employees in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect under active contracts with local unions, affiliated primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. These contracts are renegotiated periodically. Failure to negotiate a new labor agreement when required could result in a work stoppage. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been good, it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions, or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future. In addition, our non-union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past, and we could be subject to future unionization, which could lead to increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIf there is a determination that any of the Spin-Off or the internal spin-off transactions completed in connection with the Spin-Off (collectively with the Spin-Off, the \u201cSpin-Offs\u201d) is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then Herc Holdings and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and Hertz Global could incur significant liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-Offs, Herc Holdings received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to the effect that, subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants, (i) the Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and (ii) the internal spin-off transactions will qualify as tax free under Section 355 of the Code. A private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS. However, the IRS ruling did not rule that the Spin-Offs satisfied every requirement for a tax-free spin-off, and Herc Holdings and Hertz Global relied solely on opinions of professional advisors to determine that such additional requirements were satisfied. The ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Herc Holdings and Hertz Holdings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Herc Holdings and Hertz Global, and their affiliates may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Offs and related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for any other reason, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Herc Holdings or Hertz Global after the Spin-Off. If the Spin-Offs or related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Herc Holdings and Hertz Global and, in certain cases, their stockholders (at the time of the Spin-Off) could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, including taxation on the value of the Hertz Global stock distributed in the Spin-Off and the value of other companies distributed in the internal Spin-Off transactions, and Hertz Global could incur significant liabilities, either directly to the tax authorities or under a Tax Matters Agreement entered into with Herc Holdings.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nSome or all of our deferred tax assets could expire if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit our ability to utilize tax attributes, including net operating losses, capital loss carryovers, excess foreign tax carry forwards, and credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income. Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382(g) of the Code. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Hertz Global's ownership of one or more \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally should be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss carryforward equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation accumulates each year to the extent that there is any unused limitation from a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax losses and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 depends on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d, it is possible that a significant portion of our tax attributes could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income. Many states adopt the federal section 382 rules and therefore have similar limitations with respect to state tax attributes.\nWe face risks related to liabilities and insurance.\nOur businesses expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of the vehicles rented or sold by us, and for employment-related injury claims by our employees. The Company is currently a defendant in numerous actions and has received numerous claims on which actions have not yet been commenced for public liability and property damage arising from the operation of motor vehicles rented from the Company. We self-insure up to $10 million per occurrence globally, except $5 million Self Insured Retention for Europe Automobile Liability. In addition, the Company has $200 million insurance coverage excess of retentions. We cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our historical levels resulting from multiple payouts or otherwise, that liabilities in respect of existing or future claims will not exceed the level of our insurance, that we will have sufficient capital available to pay any uninsured claims or that insurance with unaffiliated carriers will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Insurance and Risk Management\u201d and Note 16, \"Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in multiemployer pension plans or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent and certain multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have underfunded liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe participate in various \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. Our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any liability or obligation imposed under them, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and motor and waste oils. We cannot assure you that our tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If leakage or a spill occurs, it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup, investigation and remediation, as well as any resulting fines, could be significant. We cannot assure you that compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\u2019\u2019 in this 2018 Annual Report.\nThe U.S. Congress and other legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our vehicle, and/or other, costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, used-car sales (including retail sales), cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of U.S. laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, including our profitability. Those changes may occur through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nAny new, or change in existing, U.S. law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability. For further discussion regarding how changes in the regulation of insurance intermediaries may affect us, see Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Insurance and Risk Management\u2019\u2019 in this 2018 Annual Report. If customers decline to purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environments in the areas of customer and employee privacy, data security, and cross-border data flows could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities, and the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements. It is also possible that we could encounter significant liability for failing to comply with any such requirements.\nWe derive revenue through rental activities of the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands under franchise and license arrangements. These arrangements are subject to various international, federal and state laws and regulations that impose limitations on our interactions with counterparties. In addition, the used-vehicle sale industry, including our network of company-operated retail vehicle sales locations, is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor vehicle sales, retail installment sales and related finance and insurance matters, advertising, licensing, consumer protection and consumer privacy. Changes in these laws and regulations that impact our franchising and licensing agreements or our used-vehicle sales could adversely affect our results.\nIn most jurisdictions where we operate, we pass-through various expenses, including the recovery of vehicle licensing\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ncosts and airport concession fees, to our rental customers as separate charges. We believe that our expense pass-throughs, where imposed, are properly disclosed and are lawful. However, in the event of incorrect calculations or disclosures with respect to expense pass-throughs, or a successful challenge to the methodology we have used for determining our expense pass-through treatment, we could be subject to fines or other liabilities. In addition, we may in the future be subject to potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes or actions which could limit, restrict or prohibit our ability to separately state, charge and recover vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain proposed or enacted laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (including risk retention requirements) and amendments to the SEC's rules relating to asset-backed securities, could restrict our access to certain financing arrangements and increase our financing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and ability to compete in our industry.\nOur substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business by, among other situations: (i) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt securities and to the lenders under our various credit facilities, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration or early amortization of, such indebtedness; (ii) being difficult to refinance or borrow additional funds in the future; (iii) requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and investing activities to make payments on our debt, which would reduce our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes; (iv) increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions (such as credit-related disruptions), including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are at floating rates of interest and are not hedged against rising interest rates, and the risk that one or more of the financial institutions providing commitments under our revolving credit facilities fails to fund an extension of credit under any such facility, due to insolvency or otherwise, leaving us with less liquidity than expected; (v) placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms; and (vi) limiting our ability to react to competitive pressures, or make it difficult for us to carry out capital program spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and our efforts to improve operating margins. While the terms of the agreements and instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness contain certain restrictions upon our ability to incur additional indebtedness, they do not fully prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness and do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other obligations are added to our current liability levels without a corresponding refinancing or redemption of our existing indebtedness and obligations, these risks would increase. For a description of the amounts we have available under certain of our debt facilities, see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowing Capacity and Availability\u201d included in this 2018 Annual Report and Note 7, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2018 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOur ability to manage these risks depends on financial market conditions as well as our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to a wide range of risks, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nOur Senior Facilities and our Letter of Credit Facility contain customary events of default, subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults, that include, among others, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, cross-acceleration of certain other material indebtedness, and inaccuracy of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default thereunder, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause further defaults and/or amortization events under our other debt obligations. The credit agreement governing our Senior Facilities and the credit agreement governing our Letter of Credit Facility require us upon a change of control, as defined therein, to make an offer to repay in full all amounts outstanding thereunder upon such a change of control. Our failure to make such an offer would result\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nin an event of default thereunder. In addition, the indentures governing our Senior Notes and our Senior Second Priority Secured Notes require us upon a change of control, as defined therein, to make an offer to repurchase all of such outstanding Senior Notes and Senior Second Priority Secured Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. If we failed to repurchase the Senior Notes and Senior Second Priority Secured Notes, we would be in default under the related indenture. Certain of our other indebtedness also could result in defaults and/or amortization events upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, as defined therein. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of their related indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt.\nIf our capital resources (including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and access to other refinancing indebtedness) and operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity requirements, we may be forced to do, among other things, one or more of the following: (i) sell certain of our assets; (ii) reduce the number of our revenue earning vehicles; (iii) reduce or delay capital expenditures; (iv) obtain additional equity capital; (v) forgo business opportunities, including acquisitions and joint ventures; or (vi) restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity requirements, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reliance on asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements to purchase vehicles subjects us to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe rely significantly on asset-backed and asset-based financing to purchase vehicles. If we are unable to refinance or replace our existing asset-backed and asset-based financing or continue to finance new vehicle acquisitions through asset-backed or asset-based financing on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, then our costs of financing could increase significantly and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, interest costs, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur asset-backed and asset-based financing capacity could be decreased, our financing costs and interest rates could be increased, or our future access to the financial markets could be limited, as a result of risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements; (ii) the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset-backed indebtedness; (iii) third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements, including increased credit enhancement or required cash collateral and/or other liquid reserves; (iv) the insolvency or deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of our principal vehicle manufacturers; or (v) changes in laws or regulations, including judicial review of issues of first impression, that negatively affect any of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements.\nAny reduction in the value of certain revenue earning vehicles could effectively increase our vehicle costs, adversely affect our profitability and potentially lead to decreased borrowing base availability in our asset-backed and certain asset-based vehicle financing facilities due to the credit enhancement requirements for such facilities, which could increase if market values for vehicles decrease below net book values for those vehicles. In addition, if disposal of vehicles in the used vehicle marketplace were to become severely limited at a time when required collateral levels were rising and as a result we failed to meet the minimum required collateral levels, the principal under our asset-backed and certain asset-based financing arrangements may be required to be repaid sooner than anticipated with vehicle disposition proceeds and lease payments we make to our special purpose financing subsidiaries. If that were to occur, the holders of our asset-backed and certain asset-based debt may have the ability to exercise their right to direct the trustee or other secured party to foreclose on and sell vehicles to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe occurrence of certain events, including those described above, could result in the occurrence of an amortization event pursuant to which the proceeds of sales of vehicles that collateralize the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be required to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the affected facility or series, rather than being reinvested in our revenue earning vehicles. In the case of our asset-backed financing arrangements, certain other events, including defaults by us and our affiliates in the performance of covenants set forth in the agreements governing certain vehicle debt, could result in the occurrence of a liquidation event with the passing of time or immediately pursuant to which the trustee or holders of the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be permitted to require the sale of the assets collateralizing that series. Failure by us to have proper financing and debt management processes may result in cash shortfalls and liquidity problems, emergency financing at high interest rates, violations of debt covenants, an inability to execute strategic initiatives, which may affect our liquidity and our ability to maintain sufficient levels of revenue earning vehicles to meet customer demands and could trigger cross-defaults under certain of our other financing arrangements.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets secure certain of our outstanding indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our debt and equity holders and our business.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets, including our revenue earning vehicles and Donlen\u2019s lease portfolio, are subject to security interests or are otherwise encumbered for the lenders under our senior credit facilities, asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements. As a result, the lenders under those facilities would have a prior claim on such assets in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization, and we may not have sufficient funds to pay in full, or at all, all of our creditors or make any amount available to holders of our equity. The same is true with respect to structurally senior obligations: in general, all liabilities and other obligations of a subsidiary must be satisfied before the assets of such subsidiary can be made available to the creditors (or equity holders) of the parent entity.\nBecause substantially all of our assets are encumbered under financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial flexibility and force us to attempt to incur additional unsecured indebtedness, which may not be available to us.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may materially adversely affect our financial flexibility or may have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain of our credit facilities, our indentures and other asset-based and asset-backed financing arrangements contain covenants that, among other things, restrict Hertz and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to: (i) dispose of assets; (ii) incur additional indebtedness; (iii) incur guarantee obligations; (iv) prepay other indebtedness or amend other financing arrangements; (v) pay dividends; (vi) create liens on assets; (vii) sell assets; (viii) make investments, loans, advances or capital expenditures; (ix) make acquisitions; (x) engage in mergers or consolidations; (xi) change the business conducted by us; and (xii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nOur Senior RCF and our Letter of Credit Facility subject us to a financial maintenance covenant. Our ability to comply with this covenant will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn are subject to, among other things, the risks identified in \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nThe agreements governing our financing arrangements contain numerous covenants. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the relevant agreement, which could, in turn, cause cross-defaults under our other financing arrangements. In such event, we may be unable to borrow under the Senior RCF and certain of our other financing arrangements and may not be able to repay the amounts due under such arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nAn increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe interest rates of certain of our financing instruments are priced using a spread over LIBOR.\nThe London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in various of our financing transactions such that the interest due to the creditors pursuant to such financing transactions is calculated using LIBOR. Our term loan agreement also contains a stated minimum floor value for LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. At this time, due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain of our financing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Additionally, these changes may have an impact on the value of any LIBOR-based marketable securities, fleet leases, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities.\nRISKS RELATING TO HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. COMMON STOCK\nHertz Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own and depends on its subsidiaries for cash.\nThe operations of Hertz Holdings are conducted nearly entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. However, none of the subsidiaries of Hertz Holdings are obligated to make funds available to Hertz Holdings for the payment of dividends or the service of its debt. In addition, certain states' laws and the terms of certain of our debt agreements significantly restrict, or prohibit, the ability of Hertz and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to Hertz Holdings, including state laws that require dividends to be paid only from surplus. If Hertz Holdings does not receive cash from its subsidiaries, then Hertz Holdings' financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nHertz Holdings' share price may decline if it issues a large number of new shares or if a holder of a substantial number of shares sells their stock.\nHertz Holdings has a significant number of authorized but unissued shares, including shares available for issuance pursuant to various equity plans. In addition, in recent years, several shareholders, most notably affiliates of Carl Icahn,\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nhave accumulated significant amounts of Hertz Holdings common stock and may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders, including the election of directors. A sale of a substantial number of shares or other equity-related securities in the public market pursuant to new issuances or by these significant shareholders could depress the market price of Hertz Holdings' stock and impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any such sale or issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the then-existing stockholders and could have material adverse effect on the market price of Hertz Holdings' common stock. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company purchases goods and services and leases property from entities controlled by Carl Icahn and his affiliates, including The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack. It is possible that these entities could cancel, choose not to renew or renegotiate the terms of their arrangements with the Company following the sale of shares by affiliates of Carl Icahn, which could adversely impact our business.
