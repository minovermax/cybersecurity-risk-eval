{"cik": "706129", "company": "HORIZON BANCORP /IN/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in Horizon\u2019s securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes currently affect Horizon are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as information we include or incorporate by reference in this report and other filings we make with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business operations.\nIf any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or any of these assumptions proves incorrect, our results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this report are current only as of the date on which the statements were made. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks relating to our daily business. Although we undertake a variety of efforts to manage and control those risks, many of the risks are outside of our control. Among the risks we face are the following:\n\u2022\nCredit risk: the risk that loan customers or other parties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nMarket risk: the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation;\n\u2022\nLiquidity risk: the risk that Horizon or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs;\n\u2022\nOperational risk: the risk of loss resulting from fraud, inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events;\n\u2022\nEconomic risk: the risk that the economy in our markets could decline further resulting in increased unemployment, decreased real estate values and increased loan charge-offs; and\n\u2022\nCompliance risk: the risk of additional action by our regulators or additional regulation could hinder our ability to do business profitably.\nThe current economic environment poses significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain world, national and local conditions in our markets. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption since 2008. This presents financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges that in some cases have resulted in large declines in the fair values of investments and other assets, constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems, including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans. Our financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to us, but given this volatility, the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values and the allowance for loan losses, which could negatively impact our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth such as we began experiencing in the latter half of 2008 and which continued through 2014. Financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets. While we continue to take steps to decrease and limit our exposure to residential construction and land development loans and home equity loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets, and we are affected by these events.\nContinued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job loss, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further deterioration in local economic conditions in our\nHORIZON BANCORP\nmarkets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences: increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures; demand for our products and services may decline; deposits may decrease, which would adversely impact our liquidity position; and collateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nOur financial performance may be adversely impacted if we are unable to continue to grow our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, obtain low-cost funds and compete with other providers of financial services.\nOur ability to maintain our history of record earnings year after year will depend, in large part, on our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolios and obtain low-cost funds.\nWe have funded our growth with low-cost consumer deposits, and our ability to sustain our growth will depend in part on our continued success in attracting and retaining such deposits or finding other sources of low-cost funds.\nAnother factor in maintaining our history of record earnings will be our ability to expand our scope of available financial services to our customers in an increasingly competitive environment. In addition to other banks, our competitors include credit unions, securities brokers and dealers, mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and finance and insurance companies. Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with our competitors. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.\nOur commercial and consumer loans expose us to increased credit risks.\nWe have a large percentage of commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans generally have greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful business operations of the borrowers. These loans also typically have much larger loan balances than residential mortgage loans. Consumer loans generally involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans because they are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate in value. Although we undertake a variety of underwriting, monitoring and reserving protections with respect to these types of loans, there can be no guarantee that we will not suffer unexpected losses, and recently, we have experienced an increase in the default rates in our consumer loan portfolio, particularly relating to indirect auto loans.\nOur holdings of construction, land and home equity loans may pose more credit risk than other types of mortgage loans.\nConstruction loans, loans secured by commercial real estate and home equity loans generally entail more risk than other types of mortgage loans. When real estate values decrease, the developers to whom we lend are likely to experience a decline in sales of new homes from their projects. Land and construction loans are more likely to become non-performing as developers are unable to build and sell homes in volumes large enough for orderly repayment of loans and as other owners of such real estate (including homeowners) are unable to keep up with their payments. We strive to establish what we believe are adequate reserves on our financial statements to cover the credit risk of these loan portfolios. However, there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our reserves, and ultimately result in a material level of charge-offs, which could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and capital.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nThe allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and non-performing assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our profitability depends on our ability to manage our assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates. If rates increase rapidly as a result of an improving economy, we may have to increase the rates paid on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than loans and investments re-price, resulting in a negative impact on interest spreads and net interest income. The impact of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected, as competitive pressures could keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, and prepayments and curtailments on assets may continue. Such movements may cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin, and therefore, decrease our profitability.\nChanges in interest rates also could affect loan volume. For instance, an increase in interest rates could cause a decrease in the demand for mortgage loans (and other loans), which could result in a significant decline in our revenue stream.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.\nAn economic slowdown in our primary market areas could affect our business.\nOur primary market area for deposits and loans consists of Northwest and Central Indiana and Southwest and Central Michigan. During 2014, unemployment rates have lowered, however remain at elevated levels. An economic slowdown could hurt our business and the possible consequences of such a downturn could include the following:\n\u2022\nincreases in loan delinquencies and foreclosures;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans;\n\u2022\nan increase in loans charged off;\n\u2022\nan increase in the Company\u2019s expense to fund loan loss reserves;\n\u2022\nan increase in collection costs;\n\u2022\na decline in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nan increase in non-accrual loans and other real estate owned.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could affect our ability to operate effectively.\nWe depend heavily on the services of our existing senior management team, particularly our CEO Craig M. Dwight, to carry out our business and investment strategies. As we continue to grow and expand our business and our locations, products and services, we will increasingly need to rely on Mr. Dwight\u2019s experience, judgment and expertise as well as that of the other members of our senior management team and will also need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel at all levels. Competition for such personnel is intense in our geographic market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain talented people, our business could suffer. The loss of the services of any senior management personnel, particularly Mr. Dwight, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe periodically evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. We generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company,\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company,\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to our business,\n\u2022\nPotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from day-to-day operations,\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees, business and customers of the target company,\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the value of the target company, and\n\u2022\nPotential problems in integrating the target company\u2019s systems, customers and employees with ours.\nAs a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving the payment of cash or the issuance of our debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. To the extent we were to issue additional common shares in any such transaction, our current shareholders would be diluted and such an issuance may have the effect of decreasing our stock price, perhaps significantly. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, merger and acquisition costs incurred by Horizon may temporarily increase operating expenses.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund acquisitions and to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments, regulatory capital requirements and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Although we are currently, and have historically been, \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes, our capital levels are not far in excess of the well capitalized threshold, and in the past we have been required to maintain increased levels of capital in connection with certain acquisitions. Additionally, we periodically explore acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions, some of which are in distressed financial condition. Any future acquisition, particularly the acquisition of a significantly troubled institution or an institution of comparable size to us, may require us to raise additional capital in order to obtain regulatory approval and/or to remain well capitalized.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve.\nWe cannot guarantee that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our\nHORIZON BANCORP\nliquidity. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations and may restrict our ability to grow.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the level of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not have to increase the allowance for loan losses and/or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.\nOur mortgage warehouse and indirect lending operations are subject to a higher fraud risk than our other lending operations.\nWe buy loans originated by mortgage bankers and automobile dealers. Because we must rely on the mortgage bankers and automobile dealers in making and documenting these loans, there is an increased risk of fraud to us on the part of the third-party originators and the underlying borrowers. In order to guard against this increased risk, we perform investigations on the mortgage companies with whom we do business, and we review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance. However, there is no guarantee that our procedures will detect all cases of fraud or legal noncompliance.\nOur mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to resell mortgages or experience other problems with the secondary market process or are unable to retain our mortgage loan sales force due to regulatory changes.\nCurrently, we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate. The profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and to sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, we are dependent upon the existence of an active secondary market and our ability to profitably sell loans into that market.\nOur ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (the \u201cAgencies\u201d) and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including the Agencies, are government-sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of such government-sponsored enterprises could, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nIn September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. Although to date, the conservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations, and during 2010 and 2012 the Federal Housing Finance Agency indicated that the Treasury Department is committed to fund Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to levels needed in order to sufficiently meet their funding needs, it is currently unclear whether further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations. In addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the Agencies and other institutional and non-institutional investors. Our ability to remain eligible may also depend on having an acceptable peer-relative delinquency ratio for the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to Ginnie Mae pools that are below Ginnie Mae guidelines. In the case of Ginnie Mae pools, we have repurchased delinquent loans from them in the past to maintain compliance with the minimum required delinquency ratios. Although these loans are typically insured as to principal by the FHA, such repurchases increase our capital and liquidity needs, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital or liquidity to continue to purchase such loans out of the Ginnie Mae pools if required to do so.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nAny significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the Agencies could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time-to-time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk in that our goodwill may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $32.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates could result in impairment of goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, then we would record the appropriate charge, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position. For further discussion, see Notes 1 and 11, \u201cNature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cIntangible Assets,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and changes in laws and regulatory policies could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in the description of our Business in Item 1 of Part I of this report for detailed information on the laws and regulations to which we are subject. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulator policies can materially affect our business. The likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to determine. As an example, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or by regulatory or bankruptcy court action that reduces the amount the Bank\u2019s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits its ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible.\nLegislation enacted in recent years, together with additional actions announced by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory agencies, continue to develop. It is not clear at this time what impact the Dodd-Frank Act, other recent legislation and liquidity and funding initiatives of the U.S. Treasury and other bank regulatory agencies, and additional programs that may be initiated in the future will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry.\nOur inability to continue to accurately process large volumes of transactions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nIn the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. If systems of internal control should fail to work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the system of internal controls, significant losses could result.\nWe process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside Horizon, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that are designed to provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures also exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the consequences of operational errors.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nWhile we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately or timely addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of business, loss of customer information, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we are insured against many of these risks, including privacy breach response costs, notification expenses, breach support and credit monitoring expenses, cyber extortion and cyber terrorism, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all costs arising from a data or information technology breach and our exposure may exceed our coverage.\nWe continually encounter technological changes.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including Internet connections, mobile and internet banking, network access and transaction and other processing services. Although we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of inadequate or interrupted service or breach of customer information, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. In addition, any breach in customer information could affect our reputation and cause a loss of business. Replacing these third- party vendors also could result in significant delay and expense.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation, privacy breach and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about Horizon, whether or not true, may result in harm to our existing business, customer relationships and prospects. Should any events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, our stock price constantly changes, and we expect our stock price to continue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nincreases in loan losses, non-performing loans and other real estate owned;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nloss of our inclusion on the Russell 3000 or other indices;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022\nour past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022\nour creditworthiness;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nthe credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u2022\neconomic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory, congressional or judicial events that affect us or the financial markets.\nIn addition the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies and particularly those in the financial services and banking sector, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results.\nBecause our stock is thinly traded, it may be more difficult for you to sell your shares or buy additional shares when you desire to do so and the price may be volatile.\nAlthough our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ stock market since December 2001, our common stock is thinly traded. The prices of thinly traded stocks, such as ours, are typically more volatile than stocks traded in a large, active public market and can be more easily impacted by sales or purchases of large blocks of stock. Thinly traded stocks are also less liquid, and because of the low volume of trades, you may be unable to sell your shares when you desire to do so.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nOur participation in the Small Business Lending Fund program restricts our ability to pay dividends and to repurchase our securities and could have other negative effects.\nOn August 25, 2011, we sold 12,500 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the Small Business Lending Fund program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. The terms of the Series B Preferred Stock impose limits on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, no repurchases may be effected, and no dividends may be declared or paid on preferred shares ranking pari passu with the Series B Preferred Stock, junior preferred shares, or other junior securities (including our common stock) during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, except that, in any such quarter in which the dividend is paid, dividend payments on shares ranking pari passu may be paid to the extent necessary to avoid any resulting material covenant breach. In addition, we may declare and pay a dividend on our common stock or other stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, only if, after payment of such dividend, the dollar amount of the Company\u2019s Tier 1 Capital would be at least 90% of the Signing Date Tier 1 Capital, which was $118,724,000, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and any redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock. Horizon does not anticipate that these restrictions will affect its ability to pay dividends on its common stock; however, given the possibility of unforeseen developments or events, there can be no guarantee that Horizon will be able to pay dividends on its common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws, and Indiana law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us by a third party.\nOur articles of incorporation and by-laws and Indiana law contain provisions that have certain anti-takeover effects. While the purpose of these provisions is to strengthen the negotiating position of the board in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, the overall effects of these provisions may be to render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a larger block of our shares, and the removal of incumbent directors and key management.\nOur articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board, which means that only one-third of our board can be replaced by shareholders at any annual meeting. Our articles also provide that our directors may only be removed without cause by shareholders owning 70% or more of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, our articles provide that only our board of directors, and not our shareholders, may adopt, alter, amend and repeal our by-laws.\nOur articles also preempt Indiana law with respect to business combinations with a person who acquires 10% or more of our common stock and provide that such transactions are subject to independent and super-majority shareholder approval requirements unless certain pricing and board pre-approval requirements are satisfied.\nOur by-laws do not permit cumulative voting of shareholders in the election of directors, allowing the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares to control the election of all our directors, and our directors are elected by plurality (not majority) voting. Our by-laws also establish detailed procedures that shareholders must follow if they desire to nominate directors for election or otherwise present issues for consideration at a shareholders\u2019 meeting. We also have a mandatory retirement age for directors.\nThese and other provisions of our governing documents and Indiana law are intended to provide the board of directors with the negotiating leverage to achieve a more favorable outcome for our shareholders in the event of an offer for the company. However, there is no assurance that these same anti-takeover provisions could not have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of our shareholders.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nRisks Related to the Series B Preferred Stock\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness; regulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock; and the Series B Preferred Stock places no limitations on the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur in the future.\nShares of the Series B Preferred Stock are equity interests in Horizon and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series B Preferred Stock, like our common stock, ranks junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims against Horizon with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against Horizon, including in a liquidation of Horizon. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock like the Series B Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only when, as and if authorized and declared by our Board of Directors and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, debt service requirements, other cash needs and any other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. The current terms of the Series B Preferred Stock require dividends to be paid in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year.\nHorizon is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank, our principal subsidiary, and derives a significant portion of its revenue in the form of dividends from the Bank. Accordingly, Horizon is and will be dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of, and interest on, its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock. Horizon\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements while maintaining its required capital. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Horizon, Horizon may not be able to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock does not limit the amount of debt or other obligations we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series B Preferred Stock or to which the Series B Preferred Stock will be structurally subordinated.\nAn active trading market for the Series B Preferred Stock does not currently exist and is unlikely to develop.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is not currently listed on any national securities exchange, and we do not intend to list the Series B Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange unless we are requested to do so by the U.S. Treasury. Even if requested to so do by the U.S. Treasury, it is not certain that such a listing can be achieved given the current exchange listing requirements, and even if listing is achieved, it is unlikely that an active trading market for the Series B Preferred Stock will develop, or, if developed, that an active trading market will be maintained. If an active trading market does not develop, the market value and liquidity of the Series B Preferred Stock may be adversely affected.\nDividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative.\nDividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. If our Board of Directors does not authorize and declare a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock for any dividend period, such unpaid dividend will not accrue and will not be payable to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock even if dividends are declared for any subsequent dividend period. However, a failure to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will restrict our ability to pay dividends with respect to and repurchase shares of other classes and series of stock.\nThe dividend rate on the Series B Preferred Stock fluctuated based on our level of Qualified Small Business Lending as compared to our Small Business Lending Baseline.\nThe per annum dividend rate on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock applicable to the first quarter they were outstanding was 5%. For the second through tenth quarters, the rate was adjusted quarterly to reflect the percent of change in our Qualified Small Business Lending from our Small Business Lending baseline and fluctuated between 1% and 5% per annum. The dividend rate became a fixed rate for the eleventh quarter through February 2016, which is the date that is four-and-a-half years from the issuance date of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and was based on the rate in effect for the tenth quarter. At the beginning of the tenth full calendar quarter after issuance (January 1, 2014), the amount of Qualified Small Business Lending had increased over the baseline enough to maintain the dividend rate at 1% until February 2016. For all quarters subsequent to the four-and-one-half year anniversary of issuance, the rate will be 9% per annum.\nHORIZON BANCORP\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock have limited voting rights.\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock only have the right to vote as a separate class on certain matters relating to the rights of holders of Series B Preferred Stock and on certain corporate transactions.
