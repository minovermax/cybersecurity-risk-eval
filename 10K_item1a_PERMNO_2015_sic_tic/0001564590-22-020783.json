{"cik": "716133", "company": "CINCINNATI BELL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions have adversely affected the Company\u2019s business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow and are expected to continue to do so for an unknown period of time.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national emergency relating to the outbreak. The outbreak has spread globally and has, and continues to, adversely affect workforces, customers and consumer sentiment and, along with a decrease in consumer spending, has led to an economic downturn in many markets. National, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing measures and have imposed and continue to consider quarantine and isolation measures for large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, have had, and are expected to continue to have, serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration.\nIn the United States and in other countries and regions where we have a significant employee presence, facilities or critical operations, the outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our ability to manage day-to-day operations and service our customers. It has also increased our costs of operations and resulted in, among other things, loss of revenue. For example, we have implemented corporate and personal travel restrictions for employees and vendors, cancelled events and enabled work-from-home for many employees by equipping them to safely support customers remotely. We have also implemented additional safety measures for our retail stores and field operations teams. Due to stay-at-home orders easing in the primary markets in which the Company operates, day-to-day operations normalized for most of 2021. In late 2021 the Omicron variant was identified and started to spread across both the vaccinated and unvaccinated population resulting in temporary closures of certain business in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of staffing limitations. The ultimate impact of this variant and future variants is unknown, and the Company may be required to temporarily close or reduce operations at certain of its retail locations, facilities or call centers again due to the resurgence of the COVID-19 omicron variant in the markets in which the Company operates. We expect the foregoing effects and other effects of COVID-19 to continue for an unknown period of time.\nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by the effects of, or precautions taken to avoid exposure to, COVID-19, such as reduced travel, or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine, and by the resulting disruptions to economic conditions and financial markets. Such impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our third-party providers, including those who provide many of our information technology, call center functions, certain accounting functions and other critical vendor services;\n\u2022\nReduced workforces caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of the workforce to work due to illness, quarantine, government mandates, or temporary unwillingness to work due to health concerns;\n\u2022\nIncreased labor and material costs with certain third-party providers that are contracted to support and perform activities associated with the build-out of our fiber network.\n\u2022\nReduced customer demand or customer payment of accounts receivables as a result of adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nReduced availability of certain network equipment in the supply chain due to increased demand and certain suppliers who have had, or continue to have, workforce constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPotential future impacts include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nIncreased supply chain risks such as increased scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nIncreased health insurance and labor-related costs arising from illness, quarantine and the implementation of social distancing and work-from-home measures;\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\n\u2022\nReduced availability of employees or increased attrition due to new government orders or mandates, such as government-imposed vaccine mandates\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third parties as a result of employees or third-party vendors\u2019 employees working remotely; and\n\u2022\nIn the event of a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue or other event that impacts our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue to support our customers\u2019 needs and respond to inquiries through call center operations or to perform necessary repairs and maintenance.\nThe foregoing impacts, and other impacts of COVID-19 discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors, are consistent with those generally affecting the economic, financial, regulatory and political conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world and are generally applicable to the industries and markets in which the Company and our subsidiaries operate. These impacts could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our consumer and business sales and damage the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree. The severity and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors, including the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and suppliers.\nThe Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers. Competitors may reduce pricing, create new bundled offerings, or develop new technologies, products or services that they can offer in expanded geographic regions. Our competitors are expected to continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings. If the Company cannot continue to offer reliable, competitively priced, value-added services, or if the Company does not keep pace with technological advances and upgrades, competitive forces could adversely affect it through a loss of market share or a decrease in revenue and profit margins.\nThe Network segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, cable, broadband and internet service providers, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless voice and data plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution for the Company\u2019s services. The Company believes wireless substitution accounts for the largest portion of its access line losses. Also, cable competitors that have existing service relationships with the Company's customers in the Network segment offer substitution services, such as VoIP and long distance voice services in the Company's operating areas. As a result of wireless substitution and increased competition, legacy voice lines decreased by 11% and 14% in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020.\nIn addition, our strategic products, particularly our fiber-based products, face competition from a number of different sources including cable operators, other telecom companies, niche fiber companies, and companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration in our Consumer/SMB Fiber products. If the Company is unable to effectively implement strategies to attract and retain video and high-speed internet subscribers, retain access lines and long distance subscribers, or replace such customers with other sources of revenue, the Company's Network segment will be adversely affected.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous other information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are large in scope and well-financed. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, which may provide competitive advantages. The Company believes that many of the participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully in the market. The competitive forces described above could adversely affect the Company\u2019s IT Services and Hardware segment and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company may be unable to grow its revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives it has implemented.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facilities, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives. We cannot be assured that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has, and may continue to, negatively impact these opportunities and require us to incur additional related costs such as overtime wages for employees that are working additional hours to offset employees that are following quarantine protocol and personal protective equipment for field technicians and customer facing employees.\nIf the Company\u2019s goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, the Company may be required to record significant charges to earnings.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on its balance sheet. The Company reviews goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment evaluation requires significant judgment and estimates by management, and unfavorable changes in these assumptions or other factors could result in future impairment charges and have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reported earnings. Such factors include operating performance of the business, the execution of the Company\u2019s network build plan, growth of consumer and business activations, higher than anticipated churn, changes in customer behavior post-pandemic, ability of the infrastructure practice to obtain product on a timely basis, changes in discount rates, or other key business initiatives. Additionally, value of comparable companies may also impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and reduction to net income.\nFor further information on Cincinnati Bell\u2019s evaluation of impairment for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d under Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFailure to anticipate the need to introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company\u2019s success in our industries.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on being able to anticipate the needs of current and future business, carrier and consumer customers. The Company seeks to meet these needs through new product introductions, service quality and technological improvements. New products and services are important to the Company\u2019s success because our industry is technologically driven, such that new technologies can offer alternatives to the Company\u2019s existing services. If our new products and services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these new products and services materially increase, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of its revenues by delivering voice and data services over access lines. The Company's local telecommunications subsidiaries have experienced substantial access line losses over the past several years due to a number of factors, including wireless and broadband substitution and increased competition. The Company expects access line losses to continue into the foreseeable future. Failure to retain access lines without replacing such losses with an alternative source of revenue would adversely impact the Company's revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.\nThe Company has provided alternative sources of revenue by way of its strategic products; however, these products may generate lower profit margins than its traditional services. In addition, as a larger portion of our customer base has already migrated to these new product offerings, a decreased growth rate of strategic products can be expected. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that the revenues generated from our new offerings will mitigate revenue losses from the reduced sales of our legacy products or that our new strategic offerings will be as successful as anticipated.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video programming may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels, which could result in the loss of subscribers. In addition, due to the influence of some content providers, we may be forced to pay higher rates for some content resulting in increased costs.\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry. These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed upon contract with a content owner, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content with which customers do not associate much value, in order to have access to other content with which customers do associate value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content may continue to increase and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs.\nThe Company\u2019s agreements with its customers contain various requirements regarding performance and levels of service. If the Company fails to provide the levels of service or performance required by its agreements, customers may be able to receive financial compensation or may be able to terminate their relationship with the Company. In order to provide these levels of service, the Company is required to protect against human error, natural disasters, equipment failure, power failure, sabotage and vandalism, and have disaster recovery plans available in the event of disruption of service. Additionally, in the event that a significant number of our field technicians are affected by COVID-19, our ability to maintain our network could be reduced or could require significant overtime by unaffected field technicians. The failure to address these or other events may result in a disruption of service. In addition, any inability to meet service level commitments or other performance standards could reduce the confidence of customers. Decreased customer confidence could impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and operating results.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving a limited geographic area.\nThe Company generates a substantial portion of revenue by serving customers in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio and the islands of Hawaii. An economic downturn or natural disaster occurring in any of these limited operating territories would have a disproportionate effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope and similar companies operating in different geographic areas. Furthermore, because of Hawaii\u2019s geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of the business in Hawaii is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. The impact of COVID-19 on the Hawaiian Islands has been, and could continue to be, more significant than in other geographies due to reliance on tourism by many businesses and reductions in tourism due to social distancing measures, self-quarantine and vaccine requirements for visitors and recommendations of federal, state and local governments.\nThe customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.5 million, approximately 70% of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu (including the outbreak of COVID-19), or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to increased costs for goods and services that we are unable to control or defray as a result of operating in this limited territory. Increased expenses including, but not limited to, energy and health care could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nOne large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating results to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Verizon Communications Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d) comprised 26% and 20% of consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. As a result of these concentrations, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected if the Company lost this customer or if products and services purchased were significantly reduced. In addition, if Verizon were to default on its accounts receivable obligations, the Company would be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established. This would also negatively impact the available borrowing capacity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization facility (\"Receivables Facility\").\nMaintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s market share and ability to generate revenue.\nOver the past several years, the Company has improved its wireline network through increased capital expenditures for fiber optic cable in areas of its operating network. The Company intends to continue its capital expenditures for fiber optic cable.\nIn order to provide appropriate levels of service to the Company's customers, the network infrastructure must be protected against damage from human error, natural disasters, unexpected equipment failure, power loss or telecommunications failures, terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism. The Company's networks may not address all of the problems that may be encountered in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated problems, which may result in disruption of service to customers.\nThe Company may also incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated developments, regulatory changes and other events that impact the business.\nIncreases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional internet activity such as web browsing and email. As utilization rates and availability of these services continue to grow, our high-speed internet customers may use much more bandwidth than in the past. If this continues to occur and our existing network capacity becomes unable to handle the increased demand, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers. We may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks.\nThe law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on, stored or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled. As such, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to content disseminated on our networks. Claims could challenge the accuracy of materials on our network or could involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement. If we need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our financial results would be negatively affected.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAn IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data or other sensitive data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks and other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. Our business relies on the integrity and availability of our technology infrastructure and systems and the processes that deliver services to our customers and business partners. The security of data we create or collect is also important to our customers, business partners and stakeholders.\nWe have a comprehensive security program in place designed to mitigate risks to our business from:\n\u2022\nPhysical and personnel security threats;\n\u2022\nData breaches involving customer, employee and other confidential data;\n\u2022\nMalware, including ransomware;\n\u2022\nDenial of service threats;\n\u2022\nUnauthorized changes to technology systems and data;\n\u2022\nFraud;\n\u2022\nHacking, including nation-state sponsored attacks on critical infrastructure;\n\u2022\nUnauthorized or unintentional actions by third parties;\n\u2022\nCompliance failures;\n\u2022\nDisasters and business continuity events; and\n\u2022\nMisuse of our systems, products and services.\nAlthough we take proactive and reasonable steps to address these risks, including the use of insurance, we understand that physical and cyber security incidents are possible and could have a material effect to our businesses. Costs associated with a major security incident could include material retention incentives offered to existing customers or business partners, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation, fines from regulatory authorities, and increased expenditures for technology, security measures, and incident response. These costs or any prolonged disruption to our business operations could result in a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. To date, we have not experienced any material security incident and continue to evaluate security risks to our businesses. We proactively review our security posture and adopt new control measures that address current and future physical and cyber security threats.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties providing critical services or with access to or possession of sensitive data could also adversely impact business operations or result in regulatory actions, loss of customers, legal fees or increased costs, associated with incident response beyond current insurance limits. Cyber-attacks of technology that is used in the organization\u2019s supply-chain to provide network and IT services or that are resold to customers could also have the same adverse impacts.\nWeather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, and other political instability, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and events beyond our control. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. A natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations as well as lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nIn particular, from time to time, the islands of Hawaii experience severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can overwhelm our employees, disrupt our services and severely damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the extent to which climate change could cause extreme weather conditions to become more frequent or more extreme.\nThe Company depends on a number of third-party providers and the loss of or problems with one or more of these providers may impede the Company\u2019s growth, cause it to lose customers or materially and adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on third-party providers to supply products and services. For example, many of the Company\u2019s information technology, call center functions and certain accounting functions are performed by third-party providers and network equipment is purchased from and maintained by vendors, some of which providers and vendors are located outside of the United States. Additionally, certain installation services sold by our IT Services and Hardware segment are performed by third-party providers.\nEvents that adversely impact our third-party providers could impair our ability to obtain adequate and timely services or supplies. Such events include, among others, difficulties or problems associated with our third party providers\u2019 business, the financial instability and labor problems of third party providers, natural or man-made disasters, inclement weather conditions, war, acts of terrorism and other political instability, such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, economic conditions, shipment issues, and increased production costs. Our third-party providers may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy. The occurrence of one or more of these events could impact our ability to get necessary inventory to build the fiber network, result in disruptions to our operations, increase our costs and decrease our profitability.\nGovernments, public institutions and other organizations in countries and regions where cases of COVID-19 have been detected have taken certain emergency measures to combat its spread and impact, including implementation of travel bans, suspension of public transportation and closures of factories, schools, public buildings, businesses and other institutions. The loss of one or more of these third-party providers may result in an adverse effect on our ability to provide products and services to our customers. While the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is not yet known, potential effects on our business include disruptions to or restrictions on our third-party providers, suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain, including limitations on the ability of their employees to travel and temporary closures or reductions in the hours of their facilities or customer call centers.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our suppliers around the world, we have experienced shortages of certain inventory and capital assets, price increases and delays to the delivery of materials that have adversely impacted the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations. The ultimate impact of these adverse events is unknown as of the date of this filing and will be determined based on the duration of the pandemic. Additionally, we could be materially adversely impacted, including from any disruption to critical vendor services or losses of business, if any of our suppliers face significant business disruptions as a result of COVID-19 or any similar outbreak.\nA failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office information technology systems. The Company relies on back-office information technology systems to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. A failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nIf the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions when they expire, or if the Company\u2019s unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii operating territories, which represent approximately 22% of the Company\u2019s employees. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements in the future. If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with its union arise, or if its unionized workers engage in a strike or a work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations or incur higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe Company\u2019s debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and prospects generally.\nIn connection with the Merger, in September 2021, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and terminated the Company\u2019s existing corporate credit agreement. The Credit Agreement was subsequently amended in November 2021 and provides for (i) a five-year $400 million senior secured revolving credit facility including both a letter of credit subfacility of up to $40 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $10 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), (ii) a seven-year $500 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cTerm B-1 Loans\u201d), and (iii) a seven-year $650 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cTerm B-2 Loans\u201d and together with the Term B-1 Loans, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d). The Revolving Credit Facility matures in September 2026, and the Term Loans mature in November 2028. Borrowings under the Term Loans were used in part to refinance existing Company indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $400.0 million available.\nThe Company\u2019s debt has important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company is required to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nthere is a variable interest rate on a portion of its debt which will increase if the market interest rates increase;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt increases its vulnerability to adverse changes in the credit markets, which adverse changes could increase the Company's borrowing costs and limit the availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt service obligations limit its flexibility to plan for or react to changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s level of debt and shareowners\u2019 deficit may restrict it from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s debt instruments contain limitations on the Company and require the Company to comply with specified financial ratios and other restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, could limit availability to the cash required to fund the Company's operations and general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company\u2019s Credit Agreement and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on the Company. These restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase equity interests;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires the Company to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios.\nThe restrictions contained in the terms of the Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, other capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of the debt's restrictive covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the required financial ratios would result in a default under some or all of the debt agreements. During the occurrence and continuance of a default, lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect not to provide loans under the Revolving Credit Facility until such default is cured or waived. The Company\u2019s debt instruments also contain cross-acceleration provisions, which generally cause each instrument to be subject to early repayment of outstanding principal and related interest upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt instrument, subject to certain materiality thresholds. Failure to comply with these covenants, if not cured or waived, would limit the cash available to the Company required to fund operations and our general obligations and could result in the Company\u2019s dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nThe Company depends on its revolving credit facility and receivables facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited.\nThe Company depends on the Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility to provide for short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 2026. The Receivables Facility has a termination date of June 2024 and is subject to renewal every 364 days, with the next renewal occurring in June 2023.\nThe Company's ability to borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility is subject to the Company's compliance with covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios. Failure to satisfy these covenants would constrain or prohibit our ability to borrow under these facilities.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $400.0 million in additional borrowing availability under this facility. The $400.0 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility is funded by various financial institutions. If one or more of these banks is not able to fulfill its funding obligations, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had a total borrowing capacity of $215.0 million on a maximum borrowing capacity of $215.0 million on our Receivables Facility. At that date, there were $153.6 million of outstanding borrowings and $16.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. The available borrowing capacity is calculated monthly based on the amount and quality of outstanding accounts receivable and thus may be lower than the maximum borrowing limit. If the quality of the Company\u2019s accounts receivables deteriorates, this will negatively impact the available capacity under this facility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $45.1 million of borrowing capacity remaining under its Receivables Facility.\nThe servicing of the Company\u2019s indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of which are beyond its control. The Company cannot provide assurance that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that additional sources of debt financing will be available or that future borrowings will be available under its Revolving Credit Facility or Receivables Facility, in each case, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its indebtedness, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital, which may adversely affect its shareholders, debt holders and customers. The Company may not be able to negotiate remedies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. The Company\u2019s inability to generate the necessary cash flows could result in its dissolution, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nThe uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition.\nThe uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic downturn, including difficulty to hire and retain staff and a decrease in consumer and commercial activity that may continue for an extended period of time. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also create additional uncertainty in the economic environment and world securities markets. The Company\u2019s primary source of cash is customer collections. As a result of current adverse economic conditions and uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, some customers have cancelled or requested discounts on future contracted services or have had difficulty paying their accounts receivable. Additional customers may cancel or request discounts on future contracted services or have difficulty paying their accounts receivable, especially if economic conditions worsen. As a result of the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales cycle has been lengthened, and could be further lengthened, due to business customers slowing spending and/or delaying decision-making on the Company\u2019s products and services, which has adversely affected, and could further adversely affect, revenues. Some competitors have lowered prices or offered promotions as a result of economic conditions, and others may do so as well, which has exerted, and could further exert, pricing pressure on the Company. If the economies of the U.S. and the world continue to deteriorate, this could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nAdverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company\u2019s employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners\u2019 equity and liquidity.\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees and certain former executives. The Company also provides healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets indirectly reflect the value of all plan assets and benefit obligations under these plans. The accounting for employee benefit plans is complex as is the process of calculating the benefit obligations under the plans. Adverse changes in interest rates or market conditions, among other assumptions and factors, could cause a significant increase in the Company\u2019s benefit obligations or a significant decrease of the asset values, without necessarily impacting the Company\u2019s net income. In addition, the Company\u2019s benefit obligations could increase significantly if it needs to unfavorably revise the assumptions used to calculate the obligations. These adverse changes could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s shareowners\u2019 equity. Additionally, the Company\u2019s postretirement costs are adversely affected by increases in medical and prescription drug costs. Further, if there are adverse changes to plan assets or if medical and prescription drug costs increase significantly, the Company could be required to contribute additional material amounts of cash to the plans or to accelerate the timing of required payments.\nGrowing inflation, supply chain disruption and other increased operating costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nGlobal demand inflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rate increases, civil unrest, tariffs and government regulations, which are beyond our control, could adversely affect operating costs and administrative expenses such as wages, benefits, supplies and inventory costs, insurance costs and costs of borrowing. Any such increase could impact results of operations and cash flows if we do not choose, or are unable, to pass the increased costs to our customers.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for capital purchases needed to construct the fiber network, the hardware resale business and certain other supplies we use in our operations. Our ability to secure such equipment and supplies from alternative sources as needed may be time-consuming or expensive or may cause a temporary disruption in our supply chain. In recent months, we have anticipated intermittent shortages of certain supplies from our standard vendors and, accordingly, we enhanced our sourcing procedures to identify alternative suppliers and bought in excess in order to avoid any actual shortages, albeit sometimes at additional cost. Increasingly during 2021, the delivery times were extended on certain inventory items utilized by the Network business and the hardware resale business but, through alternative sourcing, we have thus far avoided any significant disruptions. Shortages or interruptions in the supply chain could occur for reasons within or beyond the control of us and the supplier. Decreased fuel supplies are anticipated to increase fuel prices, which may adversely impact our transportation costs for the field technicians and third parties who are assisting us with the network build. Any shortage or interruption to our supply chain could reduce our sales and profit margins, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIntellectual Property, Tax, Regulatory, and Litigation Risks\nThe Company\u2019s future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets of $342.2 million, which are primarily composed of deferred tax assets associated with U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $223.6 million, and state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $34.7 million. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period. The use of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets enables it to satisfy current and significant future tax liabilities without the use of the Company\u2019s cash resources. As a result of the merger, the Company\u2019s net operating losses face potential limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. If the Company is unable for any reason to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets, including its net operating losses, the Company\u2019s net income, shareowners\u2019 deficit and future cash flows would be adversely affected.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, and actions by federal, state and local taxing authorities related to the interpretation and application of such tax laws and regulations, could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company calculates, collects and remits various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges, and regulatory fees to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including but not limited to federal Universal Service Fund contributions, sales tax, regulatory fees and use tax on purchases of goods and services used in our business. Tax laws are subject to change, and new interpretations of how various statutes and regulations should be adhered to are frequently issued. In many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against the Company\u2019s new and evolving technologies and services. In the event that we have incorrectly calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts due to governmental authorities, or if revenue and taxing authorities disagree with positions we have taken, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions. In the event that federal, state, or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on goods and services used to construct and maintain our network, operations, or provision of services, or seek to impose new taxes, there could be a material adverse impact on financial results.\nThe regulation of the Company\u2019s businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict our ability to price our products and services competitively, and threaten our operating licenses.\nSeveral of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of varying degrees at both the state and federal levels, which may differ from the regulatory scrutiny faced by the Company\u2019s competitors. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory review and approval. These regulated pricing plans limit the rates the Company can charge for some services while the competition has typically been able to set rates for services with limited or no restriction. In the future, regulatory initiatives that would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage or mandate lower rates for our services would result in lower profitability and cash flows for the Company. In addition, different regulatory interpretations of existing regulations or guidelines may affect the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses in future periods.\nAt the federal level, the Company\u2019s telecommunications services are subject to the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). In addition, certain aspects of the Company\u2019s communications facilities and operations are subject to oversight by the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense relative to assessing and mitigating national security risks. Violations of the terms of the agreements with these agencies could result in the revocation of the Company\u2019s FCC licenses which would affect its business operations in the future. The Company\u2019s submarine cable facilities and operations are also subject to requirements imposed by the national security and law enforcement agencies (e.g., the Departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security). At the state level, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC (\u201cCBT\u201d) operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier (\u201cILEC\u201d) and carrier of last resort in portions of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, while Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (\u201cHTI\u201d) serves as the ILEC and carrier of last resort in Hawaii. As the ILEC in those states, these entities are subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commissions in those states. Various regulatory decisions or initiatives at the federal or state level may from time to time have a negative impact on CBT\u2019s and HTI\u2019s ability to compete in their respective markets. In addition, although less heavily regulated than the Company\u2019s ILEC operations, other subsidiaries are authorized to provide competitive local exchange service, long distance, and cable television service in various states, and consequently are also subject to various state and federal telecommunications and cable regulations that could adversely impact their operations.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThere are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding issues, including national security and law enforcement matters that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry. On April 4, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13913 Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), which formalized the ad-hoc foreign investment review process (formerly referred to as \u201cTeam Telecom\u201d) applicable to FCC licenses and transactions. The Executive Order empowers the Committee to review FCC license and transfer applications involving foreign participation to determine whether grant of the requested license or transfer approval may pose a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States, and to review existing licenses to identify any additional or new risks to national security or law enforcement interests that did not exist when a license was first granted. Following an investigation, the Committee may recommend that the FCC revoke or modify existing licenses or deny or condition approval of new licenses and license transfers. It is not possible for the Company to determine whether it may be subject to a proceeding to revoke or modify our existing licenses or predict the outcome of a review of new license or transfer applications by the Committee in the future. A review of existing licenses and/or a review of new licenses and transfers by the Committee may result in additional compliance obligations that may affect the Company\u2019s expenses and business operations in the future.\nIn addition, in connection with our internet access offerings, we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the internet. There is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services although court decisions, legislative action and/or changes in regulatory policy could lead to greater regulation of the internet (including internet access services). The Company cannot provide any assurances that changes in current or future regulations adopted by the FCC or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, will not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, different regulatory agencies conduct audits to ensure that the Company is in compliance with the respective regulations. The Company could be subject to fines and penalties if found to be out of compliance with these regulations, and these fines and penalties could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nThe Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third-party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Resolution of claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third-party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nThird parties may infringe upon the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury.\nThe Company\u2019s success significantly depends on the competitive advantage it gains from our proprietary technology and other valuable intellectual property assets. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets protections, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. If the Company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its operating results.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.\nThe Company may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police its intellectual property rights. The Company may not be able to detect third-party infringements and its competitive position may be harmed before the Company does so. In addition, competitors may design around the Company\u2019s technology or develop competing technologies. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with the Company using that intellectual property.\nThe Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require the Company to pay significant damages or settlements.\nThe industry that the Company operates in faces a substantial risk of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, securities class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection processes. Additionally, while preventative measures such as social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing personal protective equipment including masks and gloves are being taken by our field technicians, the risk of inadvertent transmission of COVID-19 through human interaction could still occur and result in litigation in states in which we operate. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards and settlements.\nThe Ohio legislature passed House Bill 606, which became effective December 16, 2020, providing for Qualified Civil Immunity due to COVID-19 from March 9, 2020, through September 30, 2021. The bill significantly limits legal exposure to Ohio businesses, which, absent a showing of reckless, intentional, or willful or wanton misconduct, would not be liable to customers, employees, or others for actions or omissions resulting in the exposure to, or transmission or contraction of, COVID-19. The bill also flatly bars class actions based in whole or in part on allegations that a health care provider, business, government entity, or person caused exposure to, or the transmission or contraction of COVID-19. The bill expired on October 1, 2021 and has not been renewed as of the date of the filing.\nThe Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health, and human safety, including those governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and the clean-up of contamination, and the emission of radio frequencies. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with environmental, health, and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of hazardous materials and other operations at its sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with or violations of such laws, the imposition of clean-up obligations and third-party suits. For instance, a number of the Company\u2019s sites formerly contained underground storage tanks for the storage of used oil and fuel for back-up generators and vehicles.\nThe Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of merger and acquisition activity.\nThe Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional advisors, printing and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger and other acquisition activity.\nForm 10-K Part I\nCincinnati Bell Inc.", "PERMNO": 47677, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CBB"}
