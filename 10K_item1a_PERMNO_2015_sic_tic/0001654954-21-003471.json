{"cik": "1104855", "company": "Support.com, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Operations, Customers and Strategy\nOur financial condition and results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter, which may cause the price of our common shares to decline.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and could do so in the future. Because our results of operations are difficult to predict, you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf\nThe performance of our partners, including the success of our partners in attracting end users of our products, which can impact the amount of revenue we derive;\n\u25cf\nChange, or reduction in or discontinuance of our programs with clients and partners;\n\u25cf\nCancellations, rescheduling or deferrals of significant customer products or service programs;\n\u25cf\nOur reliance on a small number of partners for a substantial majority of our revenue;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to successfully license and grow revenue related to our SUPERAntiSpyware\u00ae software, Guided Paths\u00ae, Support.com Cloud and our service offerings;\n\u25cf\nThe timing of our sales to our clients and our partners\u2019 resale of our products to end users and our ability to enter into new sales with partners and renew existing programs with our clients and partners;\n\u25cf\nThe availability and cost-effectiveness of advertising placements for our software products and services and our ability to respond to changes in the advertising markets in which we participate;\n\u25cf\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of our technology specialists;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to effectively match staffing levels with service volumes on a cost-effective basis;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to manage contract labor;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to hire, train, manage and retain our home-based customer support specialists and enhance the flexibility of our staffing model in a cost-effective fashion and in quantities sufficient to meet forecast requirements;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to manage costs under our self-funded health insurance program;\n\u25cf\nUsage rates on the subscriptions we offer;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to maintain a competitive cost structure for our organization;\n\u25cf\nThe rate of expansion of our offerings and our investments therein;\n\u25cf\nChanges in the markets for computers and other technology devices relating to unit volume, pricing and other factors, including changes driven by declines in sales of personal computers and the growing popularity of tablets, and other mobile devices and the introduction of new devices into the connected home;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to adapt to our clients\u2019 needs in a market space defined by frequent technological change;\n\u25cf\nSevere financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients;\n\u25cf\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures in our business;\n\u25cf\nFailure to protect our intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, incurrence of costs and disruption of our ongoing business activities as a result of acquisitions or divestitures by us;\n\u25cf\nCosts related to the defense and settlement of litigation, which can also have an additional adverse impact on us because of negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors;\n\u25cf\nCosts related to the defense and settlement of government investigations, requests for information and audits, which can also have an additional adverse impact on us because of negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors, including, without limitation, those audits, requests for information and investigations described in Part II. Item 1. Legal Proceedings of this report;\n\u25cf\nPublic health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters;\n\u25cf\nThe effects of any acquisitions, divestitures or significant investments; and\n\u25cf\nPotential losses on investments, or other losses from financial instruments we may hold that are exposed to market risk.\nDue to fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations and other factors, the price at which our common shares trades may be volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your common shares at or above the price you paid. In future periods, our stock price could decline if, amongst other factors, our revenue or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated by a limited number of clients. The loss or reduction in business from any of these clients would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for over 80% of our total revenue.\nIn the past, sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future. The loss of these or other significant relationships, the change of the terms or terminations of our arrangements with any of these customers, the reduction or discontinuance of programs or billable hours with any of these customers, or the failure of any of these customers to achieve their targets has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business. For example, our partners may decide to shorten our billable hours and use other vendors in the provision of their business and/or may periodically place these types of services out for bid. Our competitors, many of whom have significantly more resources than we do, may offer more favorable bids for the same business compared to what we offer; and as a result, we may lose, or face a decline in the business we do with these significant customers.\nWe may engage in the acquisition of other companies, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances outside of our current line of business, which may have an adverse material effect on our existing business.\nWe may engage in the acquisition of other companies, investments, joint ventures and strategic alliances outside of our current line of business to design and develop new technologies and products, to strengthen competitiveness by scaling up and to expand our existing business line into new regions. Such transactions, especially in new lines of business, inherently involve risk due to the difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, products and personnel. Integration issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, may adversely affect our existing business. Furthermore, we may incur significant acquisition, administrative and other costs in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration or restructuring of acquired businesses. In addition, we may make investments in companies outside our current line of business in an attempt to broaden our business opportunities. These investments may not provide a return or lead to an increase in our operating results, and we may not obtain the benefits of these investments that we intend to recognize when making them. There can be no assurance that these transactions will be beneficial to our business or financial condition. Even assuming these transactions are beneficial, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the new business lines acquired or achieve all or any of the initial objectives of these transactions.\nWe may make acquisitions that deplete our resources and do not prove successful.\nWe have made acquisitions in the past and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our management may not be able to effectively implement our acquisition program and internal growth strategy simultaneously. The integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial and operational challenges. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating management and personnel from these acquired entities with our management and personnel. Our failure to identify, consummate or integrate suitable acquisitions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot readily predict the timing, size or success of our future acquisitions. Even successful acquisitions could have the effect of reducing our cash balances.\nWe may pursue investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. We may not be able to identify suitable investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities, or to consummate any such transactions. In addition, our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction.\nWe may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or otherwise, each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Any future dispositions we may make could involve risks and uncertainties, including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions. For example, in connection with such dispositions, we may agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser, which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, dispositions may include the transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights or assert these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.\nWe have a history of losses, we may incur losses in the future and may not sustain profitability in the near term; and as a result, we may need to alter our business plans or change our business strategy.\nAlthough we have recently been profitable in the last two fiscal years, our profitability declined in 2020 compared to 2019. Prior to becoming profitable in 2019, we had a history of losses. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 amounted to $208.8 million. We may incur losses in the future and may not be able to sustain our profitability in the near term. As a result, we may elect or may be required to alter our business plans or change our business strategy. Any change to our business plans or strategy will present risks related to our ability to execute on these changes and may require us to make additional investments in our business, all of which could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nOur stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Further, our business, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to corporate operating performance. For example, in 2020 as a result of macroeconomic conditions and the related impact of Covid-19, the stock market experienced wide fluctuations. In the past year, our stock price has fluctuated from as low as $0.93 per share In March 2020 to a high of $2.57 in February 2021. This significant volatility may continue to occur in the future for reasons that are unrelated to our business or if our business experiences unexpected results. We believe our stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, potential future dividends or share repurchases, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on the confidence of our investors and employee retention.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements and can generally be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty.\nWe enter into written agreements with each client for our services, and we generally seek multi-year terms for such agreements. However, these agreements generally permit our clients to terminate for convenience on relatively short notice. Moreover, these agreements generally allow clients to procure similar services from other vendors, do not penalize our clients for early termination, and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments. Accordingly, we face the risk that our clients may cancel or renegotiate contracts we have with them, which may adversely affect our results. If a principal client canceled or did not renew its contract with us, our results would suffer. Clients can generally reduce the volume of services they outsource to us without any penalties, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and overall financial condition.\nOur business is based on a relatively new and evolving business model.\nWe are executing a plan to grow our business by providing customer support services provided by experts who work from their homes, creating a robust, timely and innovative library of Guided Path\u00ae self-support tools, licensing our Support.com Cloud application, and providing end-user consumer software products. We may not be able to offer these services and software products successfully. Our customer support experts are generally home-based, which requires a high degree of coordination and quality control of employees working from diverse and remote locations. We expect to invest cash generated from our existing business to support our growth initiatives. Our investments, which typically are made in advance of revenue, may not yield increased revenue to offset these expenses. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in our stage of development. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf\nMaintain our current relationships and service programs, and develop new relationships, with service partners, subscriptions, and licensees of our Support.com technical support offering on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u25cf\nReach prospective customers for our software products in a cost-effective fashion;\n\u25cf\nReduce our dependence on a limited number of partners for a substantial majority of our revenue;\n\u25cf\nSuccessfully license and grow revenue related to our consumer software, Support.com technical support subscriptions, Guided Paths\u00ae and our technology support service offerings;\n\u25cf\nManage our employees and contract labor efficiently and effectively;\n\u25cf\nMaintain gross and operating margins;\n\u25cf\nMatch staffing levels with demand for services and forecast requirements;\n\u25cf\nObtain bonuses and avoid penalties in contractual arrangements;\n\u25cf\nOperate successfully in a time-based pricing model;\n\u25cf\nOperate effectively in the SMB market;\n\u25cf\nSuccessfully introduce new, and adapt our existing, services and products for consumers and businesses;\n\u25cf\nRespond effectively to changes in the market for customer support services;\n\u25cf\nRealize benefits of any acquisitions we make;\n\u25cf\nAdapt to changes in the markets we serve;\n\u25cf\nAdapt to changes in our industry, including consolidation;\n\u25cf\nAdapt to changes in the market due to public health concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters;\n\u25cf\nRespond to government regulations relating to our current and future business;\n\u25cf\nManage and respond to present, threatened, and future litigation; and\n\u25cf\nManage and respond to present, threatened or future government investigations and audits, including, without limitation, those audits and investigations described in Part II. Item 1 Legal Proceedings of this report.\nIf we are unable to address these risks, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\nChanges in the market for computers and other consumer electronics and in the technology support services market could adversely affect our business.\nReductions in unit volumes of sales for computers and other devices we support, or in the prices of such equipment, could adversely affect our business. We offer both services that are attached to the sales of new computers and other devices, and services designed to fix existing computers and other devices. Declines in the unit volumes sold of these devices or declines in the pricing of such devices could adversely affect demand for our services or our revenue mix, either of which would harm our operating results. Further, we do not support all types of computers and devices, meaning that we must select and focus on certain operating systems and technology standards for computers, tablets, smart phones, and other devices. We may not be successful in supporting new devices in the connected home and \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d and consumers and SMBs may prefer equipment we do not support, which may decrease the market for our services and products if customers migrate away from platforms we support. In addition, the structures and pricing models for programs in the technology support services market may change in ways that reduce our revenues and our margins.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the remedial measures taken by many countries to combat the pandemic may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. Government in March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, significantly restricted travel and transportation, resulted in mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d and created significant disruption of the financial markets. The full extent of the COVID-19 impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain, out of our control and cannot be predicted.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is uncertain and impossible to predict, as such impact is largely dependent on the pandemic\u2019s impact upon our customers. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our businesses, although management believes that our home based employee model provides us with certain advantages over traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d competitors in the face of the pandemic.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which, depending on future developments, could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future. If we need to raise additional capital to support operations in the future, we may be unable to access capital markets and additional capital may only be available to us on terms that could be significantly detrimental to our existing stockholders and to our business as a result of COVID-19. We are also monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of our assets. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, future changes in expectations for sales, earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired.\nRisks related to Regulatory Oversight, Litigation or Compliance with Laws\nWe have been, are currently and may be in the future the subject of governmental investigations relating to past products and services.\nWe have been, are currently and may in the future be the subject of governmental investigations relating to our past products and how those products were used by our third-party partners.\nThese governmental inquiries could harm our reputation with customers and negatively impact our ability to sell to existing customers or attract new customers. In addition to the ongoing costs to respond to these inquiries, we could be required to make additional payments to resolve these or other governmental proceedings that may be brought in the future. In some cases, we may not be the subject of an investigation, but we may be required to expend resources, including time from our management team, to address information requests or to indemnify individual current or former employees who may become involved in governmental proceedings or also be requested to provide information. These historical proceedings, our ongoing matters and any inquiries or proceedings that arise in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and our stock price.\nWe are a party to a Consent Order with the Federal Trade Commission which imposes ongoing obligations.\nOn November 6, 2018, we entered into a Stipulation to Entry of Order for Permanent Injunction and Monetary Judgment (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d), with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), resolving a multi-year FTC investigation relating to PC Healthcheck, an obsolete software program that we developed on behalf of a third party for their use with their customers. As part of the Consent Order, we agreed to pay $10 million and to implement certain new procedures and enhance certain existing procedures. Any violation or alleged violation of the terms of the Consent Order could impose additional financial liability in the form of regulatory fines and/or legal fees, as well as harm our reputation with customers or prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and our stock price.\nWe have been named as a party to legal proceedings, including governmental proceedings, in the past and may be named in additional ones in the future, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers or employees, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products, services and/or programs, or force us to redesign our products, services and/or programs.\nWe have been named as a party to several lawsuits, government inquiries or investigations and other legal proceedings (referred to as \u201clitigation\u201d), and we may be named in additional ones in the future. Any potential litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nstop selling, offering for sale, making, having made or exporting products, services and/or programs;\n\u25cf\nlimit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us;\n\u25cf\npay substantial damages and/or license fees and/or royalties to the party bringing the claim that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results; and\n\u25cf\nattempt to redesign those products, services and/or programs that contain the allegedly problematic component.\nUnder certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses for current and former directors and officers and/or customers. If we are required to make a significant payment under any of our indemnification obligations, including those to our customers and/or on behalf of our former or current employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The ultimate outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of the outcome, may result in significant expenditures, diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business and damage to our reputation or relationship with third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights.\nOur business relies on the use and licensing of technology. Other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers, and our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, our products may infringe patents issued to third parties. In addition, as is increasingly common in the technology sector, we may be confronted with the aggressive enforcement of patents by companies whose primary business activity is to acquire patents for the purpose of offensively asserting them against other companies. From time to time, we have received allegations or claims of intellectual property infringement, and we may receive more claims in the future. We may also be required to pursue litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against allegations of infringement. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and could significantly impact our financial results. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary processes, software and other solutions. We rely upon confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or software. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful. Further, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or find alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide our solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may face class actions and similar claims that could be costly to defend or settle and result in negative publicity and diversion of management resources.\nOur business involves direct sale and licensing of services and software to consumers and SMBs, and we typically include customary indemnification provisions in favor of our partners in our agreements for the distribution of our services and software. As a result, we can be subject to consumer litigation and legal proceedings related to our services and software, including putative class action claims and similar legal actions, including, but not limited to, consumer litigation and legal proceedings. We can also be subject to employee litigation and legal proceedings related to our employment practices attempted on a class or representative basis. Such litigation can be expensive and time-consuming regardless of the merits of any action and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. The cost of defense can be large as can any settlement or judgment in an action. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and could significantly impact our financial results. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; anti-corruption such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements such as the European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d); competition; Consent Order terms (for example, the recent Consent Order we entered into with the FTC); advertising; employment; product regulations; health and safety requirements; and consumer laws. If we fail to continue to comply with these regulations, we may be unable to provide products or services to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our business. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to our businesses could have an adverse impact on the results of our operations. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, if we violate or fail to comply with any laws or regulations, applicable consent orders or decrees, a range of consequences could result, including fines, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nRisks related to our Products or Service Offerings\nOur product and service offerings are in their early stages and failure to market, sell and develop the offerings effectively and competitively could result in a lack of growth.\nA number of competitive offerings exist in the market, providing various features that may overlap with our Support.com offerings today or in the future. Some competitors in these markets far exceed our spending on sales and marketing activities and benefit from greater existing brand awareness, channel relationships and existing customer relationships. We may not be able to reach the market effectively and adequately or convey our differentiation as needed to grow our customer base. To reach our target market effectively, we may be required to continue to invest substantial resources in sales and marketing and engineering and IT activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, if we fail to develop and maintain competitive features, deliver high-quality products and satisfy existing customers, our Support.com offerings could fail to grow. Disruptions in infrastructure operations could impair our ability to deliver Support.com offerings to customers, thereby affecting our reputation with existing and prospective customers and possibly resulting in monetary penalties or financial losses.\nOur end-user software revenues are dependent on online traffic patterns and the availability and cost of online advertising in certain key placements.\nSome of our consumer end-user software revenue stream is obtained through advertising placements in certain key online media placements. From time to time a trend or a change in a key advertising placement will impact us, decreasing traffic or significantly increasing the cost or effectiveness of online advertising and therefore compromising our ability to purchase a desired volume and placement of advertisements at profitable rates. If such a change were to continue to occur, on several occasions in the past, we may be unable to attract desired amounts of traffic, our costs for advertising may further increase beyond our forecasts and our software revenues may further decrease. As a result, our operating results would be negatively impacted.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition, which may intensify as our competitors expand their operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers.\nThe competitive factors in our markets include, amongst others, are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for retaining highly skilled agents and price. The competitive environment has intensified as mergers among industry partners have reduced the number of available customers and mergers amongst our competitors have created larger companies for us to compete against. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other markets expand to become competitive with our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which may adversely affect our results of operations through the potential reduction of sales and profits.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business. We believe that maintaining and further enhancing our brand as well as our reputation will be critical to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in our markets continues to develop. Our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy of our marketing efforts;\n\u25cf\nour ability to retain existing and obtain new customers and strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nthe quality and perceived value of our services;\n\u25cf\nactions of our competitors, our strategic partners, and other third parties;\n\u25cf\npositive or negative publicity, including material on the Internet;\n\u25cf\nregulatory and other governmental related developments; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation related developments.\nIf we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may utilize marketing and advertising channels with significantly higher costs than our current channels, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results. Implementing new marketing and advertising strategies also would increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. Further, we also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. Even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased revenue, the increase might not offset our related expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly or more effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our customer base could be adversely affected, and our business, operating results, financial condition, and reputation could suffer.\nFurthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nRisks related to Employees\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees while also controlling our labor costs in a competitive labor market.\nOur customers expect a high level of customer support and product knowledge from our employees. To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified employees while at the same time control labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. Likewise, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our employees in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees and executive management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future. As such, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected.\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team. Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\nIf we fail to attract, train and manage our consumer support experts in a manner that meets forecast requirements and provides an adequate level of support for our customers, our reputation and financial performance could be harmed.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to attract, manage and retain our customer support specialists and other support personnel. If we are unable to attract, train and manage in a cost-effective manner adequate numbers of competent specialists and other support personnel to be available as service volumes vary, particularly as we seek to expand the breadth and flexibility of our staffing model, our service levels could decline, which could harm our reputation, result in financial losses under contract terms, cause us to lose customers and partners, and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to meet our need for support personnel while controlling our labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the workforce, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, including managing costs under our self-funded health insurance program which can vary substantially each reporting period, and the cost of compliance with labor and wage laws and regulations. In the case of programs with time-based pricing models, the impact of failing to attract, train and manage such personnel could directly and adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Although our service delivery and communications infrastructure enables us to monitor and manage customer support specialists remotely, because they are typically home-based and geographically dispersed, we could experience difficulties meeting services levels and effectively managing the costs, performance and compliance of these customer support specialists and other support personnel. Any problems we encounter in effectively attracting, managing and retaining our customer support specialists and other support personnel could seriously jeopardize our service delivery operations and our financial results.\nRisks related to Data Security and Technology\nDisruptions in our information technology and service delivery infrastructure and operations could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communication systems and those of our third-party service providers. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us or our service providers from accepting orders and delivering services, or cause company and consumer data to be unintentionally lost, destroyed or disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and enhance the security and reliability of our information technology and communications infrastructure could be very costly, and we may have to expend significant resources to remedy problems such as a security breach or service interruption. Interruptions in our services resulting from labor disputes, telephone or Internet failures, power or service outages, natural disasters or other events, or a security breach could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, cause customers and partners and licensees to fail to renew or to terminate their use of our offerings, and harm our reputation and our ability to attract new customers.\nCosts related to software defects or other errors in our products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time, we may experience software defects, bugs and other errors associated with the introduction and/or use of our complex software products. Despite our testing procedures, errors may occur in new products or releases after commencement of commercial deployments in the future. Such errors could result in:\n\u25cf\nLoss of or delay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\nMaterial recall and replacement costs;\n\u25cf\nDelay in revenue recognition or loss of revenue;\n\u25cf\nThe diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts;\n\u25cf\nOur having to defend against litigation related to defective products; and\n\u25cf\nDamage to our reputation in the industry that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nIn addition, the process of identifying a software error in software products that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources. We may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field, which may cause us to incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and further reputational harm. Any of these problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Despite our best efforts, security vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our products. Mitigation techniques designed to address such security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or effectively resolve such vulnerabilities. Software and firmware updates and/or other mitigation efforts may result in performance issues, system instability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, or the theft of data by third parties, any of which could significantly harm our business and reputation.\nOur systems collect, access, use, and store personal customer information and enable customer transactions, which poses security risks, requires us to invest significant resources to prevent or correct problems that may be caused by security breaches, and may harm our business.\nA fundamental requirement for online communications, transactions and support is the secure collection, storage and transmission of confidential information. Our systems collect and store confidential and personal information of our individual customers as well as our partners and their customers\u2019 users, including personally identifiable information and payment card information, and our employees and contractors may access and use that information in the course of providing services. In addition, we collect and retain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. We and our third-party contractors use commercially available technologies to secure this information. Despite these measures, parties may attempt to breach the security of our data or that of our customers. In addition, errors in the storage or transmission of data could breach the security of that information. We may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and any breach could subject us to governmental or administrative proceedings or monetary penalties, damage our relationships with partners and harm our business and reputation. Also, computers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays or loss of data. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards required by law, industry standard, or contract, and to further protect against security breaches or to correct problems caused by any security breach.\nA breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information. However, we are also dependent on a number of third-party cloud-based and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and certain finance functions, and we are, of necessity, dependent on the security systems of these providers. Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties or our employees or contractors of our facilities, our information systems or the systems of our cloud-based or other service providers, or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees. In addition, we have, from time to time, also been subject to unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks. Any theft or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information as a result of such activities could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, profitability and financial condition. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nData privacy regulations are expanding and compliance with, and any violations of, these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses.\nPrivacy legislation, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, and substantial fines and damages. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with payment card and payment fraud and with payment card processing.\nCertain of our customers use payment cards to pay for our services and products. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent payment cards or other payment data. Our failure to detect or control payment fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also subject to payment card association operating standards and requirements, as in effect from time to time. Compliance with those standards requires us to invest in network and systems infrastructure and processes. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to fines, potential contractual liabilities, and other costs, resulting in harm to our business and results of operations.\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may require us to incur significant costs and may reduce the effectiveness of our solutions, and our failure to comply with those laws or regulations may harm our business and cause us to lose customers.\nOur software and services contain features that allow our technology specialists and other personnel to access, control, monitor, and collect information from computers and other devices. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations restricting or otherwise regulating the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. Those regulations could require costly compliance measures, could reduce the efficiency of our operations, or could require us to modify or cease to provide our systems or services. Liability for violation of, costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solutions by current and future customers. In addition, we may face claims about invasion of privacy or inappropriate disclosure, use, storage, or loss of information obtained from our customers. Any imposition of liability could harm our reputation, cause us to lose customers and cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe rely on third-party technologies in providing certain of our software and services. Our inability to use, retain or integrate third-party technologies could delay service or software development and could harm our business.\nWe license technologies from third parties, which are integrated into our services, technology and end user software. Our use of commercial technologies licensed on a non-exclusive basis from third parties poses certain risks. Some of the third-party technologies we license may be provided under \u201copen source\u201d licenses, which may have terms that require us to make generally available our modifications or derivative works based on such open source code. Our inability to obtain or integrate third-party technologies with our own technology could delay service development until equivalent compatible technology can be identified, licensed and integrated. These third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our relationship with third parties were to deteriorate, or if such third parties were unable to develop innovative and saleable products, or component features of our products, we could be forced to identify a new developer and our future revenue could suffer. We may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services or software, or maintain it through our own development work, which would harm our business and operating results.\nIf our services are used to commit fraud or other similar intentional or illegal acts, we may incur significant liabilities, our services may be perceived as not secure and customers may curtail or stop using our services.\nCertain software and services we provide, including our Support.com Cloud applications, enable remote access to and control of third-party computer systems and devices. We generally are not able to control how such access may be used or misused by licensees of our software offerings or our employees. If our software is used by our employees or others to commit fraud or other illegal acts, including, but not limited to, violating data privacy laws, proliferating computer files that contain a virus or other harmful elements, interfering or disrupting third-party networks, infringing any third party\u2019s copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other rights, transmitting any unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, vulgar, obscene or otherwise objectionable material, or committing unauthorized access to computers, devices, or protected information, third parties may seek to hold us legally liable. As a result, defending such claims could be expensive and time-consuming regardless of the merits, and we could incur significant liability or be required to undertake expensive preventive or remedial actions. As a result, our operating results may suffer and our reputation may be damaged.\nRisks Related to our Pending Merger with Greenidge\nOur proposed merger with Greenidge is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. Failure to complete the merger within the expected timeframe or at all could materially and adversely affect our future business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOn March 19, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Greenidge Generation Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cGreenidge\u201d) and GGH Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenidge (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenidge. At the time the Merger is consummated, all outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and all outstanding restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock of Greenidge (the \u201cGreenidge Common Stock\u201d). Please refer to the Form 8K filed on March 22, 2021 for further information.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, a number of which are beyond our control. These conditions that must be satisfied or waived include, without limitation, (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by a majority of the holders of the outstanding shares of Company\u2019s common stock entitled to vote at a special stockholder meeting, (ii) no law or order enjoining or making illegal the consummation of the Merger being in effect, (iii) the receipt of all approvals and consents from any applicable governmental authority that are necessary for the consummation of the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (iv) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the Greenidge Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger (the \u201cIssued Stock\u201d), (v) the listing of the Issued Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or Nasdaq Capital Market, (vi) a requirement that we have at least $28,000,000 in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments, net of unpaid transaction expenses, as of the closing of the Merger and (vii) other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nWe cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. If one or more of these conditions is not satisfied, and as a result, we do not complete the Merger, or in the event the proposed Merger is not completed or is delayed for any other reason, our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be harmed because:\n\u25cf\nmanagement's and our employees' attention may be diverted from our day-to-day operations as they focus on matters related to preparing for integration of our operations with those of Greenidge.\n\u25cf\nwe could potentially lose customers, new customer contracts could be delayed or decreased and we may have difficulty hiring and retaining employees;\n\u25cf\nwe could potentially lose key employees if such employees experience uncertainty about their future roles with us and decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the proposed Merger;\n\u25cf\nwe have agreed to restrictions in the Merger Agreement that limit how we conduct our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to make certain investments and acquisitions, sell, transfer or dispose of our assets, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness. These restrictions may not be in our best interests as an independent company, and may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities, and otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations;\n\u25cf\nwe have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses related to the Merger, such as legal financial advisory and accounting fees, and other expenses that are payable by us whether or not the proposed Merger is completed;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to pay a termination fee to Greenidge if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, which would negatively affect our financial results and liquidity;\n\u25cf\nactivities related to the Merger and related uncertainties may lead to a loss of revenue and market position that we may not be able to regain if the proposed Merger does not occur; and\n\u25cf\nthe failure to, or delays in, consummating the Merger may result in a negative impression of us with customers, potential customers or the investment community.\nThe occurrence of these or other events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nIn addition, our stock price may fluctuate significantly based on announcements by us, Greenidge or other third parties regarding the proposed Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror.\nThe Merger Agreement contains \u201cno-shop\u201d restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage third party proposals relating to alternative transactions or to provide information to, or engage in discussions with, a third party in relation to an alternative transaction, subject to certain exceptions to permit our Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties. Before our Board Directors may change its recommendation to stockholders to adopt the Merger or terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a Superior Offer (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Company must, among other things, provide Greenidge with four (4) business days\u2019 notice and, if requested by Greenidge, engage in good faith negotiations with Greenidge to consider certain adjustments to the Merger Agreement so that the alternative acquisition proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer. Upon the termination of the Merger Agreement, including in connection with a Superior Offer, we may be required to pay $3.5 million as a termination fee.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third party acquiror from considering or proposing an acquisition transaction, even if it were prepared to pay a higher per share price than what would be received in the Merger. These provisions might also result in a potential third party acquiror proposing to pay a lower price per share to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $3.5 million termination fee that may become payable.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nOur executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and members of our Board of Directors may be deemed to have interests in the Merger that may be different from or in addition to those of our stockholders, generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. Our Board of Directors was aware of these potentially differing interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions thereunder. These interests relate to or arise from, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe consideration to be received in respect of options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and restricted stock unit awards held by our executive officers and members of our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nthe receipt of certain payments and benefits to which certain executive officers may become entitled pursuant to such executive officers\u2019 respective employment agreements and in connection with the completion of the Merger; and\n\u25cf\nthe right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers following the completion of the Merger.\nWe could become subject to lawsuits, including class actions, relating to the Merger, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe, our directors and officers, Greenidge and Merger Sub could become subject to lawsuits, including class actions, brought by shareholders relating to the Merger. Such litigation is very common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of any merits related to the underlying acquisition. While we intend to defend against any actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOne of the conditions to consummating the Merger is that no law or order issued by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction enjoining or making illegal the consummation of the Merger is in effect. Consequently, if any of the plaintiffs in any such lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the parties from consummating the Merger, such injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed in the expected timeframe, or at all.\nWe have obligations under certain circumstances to hold harmless and indemnify our directors and officers against judgments, fines, settlements and expenses related to claims against such directors and officers and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Such obligations may apply to the current lawsuits and any other potential litigation. However, an unfavorable outcome in any lawsuit related to the Merger could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger and result in substantial costs to us.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with the Merger, whether or not it is consummated.\nWe will incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, whether or not it is completed. Payment of these expenses by us as a standalone entity would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and would likely adversely affect our stock price.\nGeneral business risks\nOur indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder Delaware law, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors, officers and/or employees with respect to past, current and future investigations and litigation. For example, we have incurred indemnification expenses in connection with the FTC investigation completed in March 2019. In such instances, we are required to, or we have otherwise agreed to, advance, and have advanced, legal fees and related expenses to certain of our current and former directors, officers and employees, and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending. Indemnification obligations may not be \u201ccovered matters\u201d under our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, or there may be insufficient coverage available. Further, in the event the directors and officers are ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them. We cannot provide any assurances that future indemnification claims, including the cost of fees, penalties or other expenses, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Additionally, to the extent there is coverage of these claims, the insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, the insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us for insured claims. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that claims will not arise that are in excess of the limits of our insurance or that are not covered by the terms of our insurance policy. Due to these coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by a number of factors.\nOur overall tax provisions and accruals are affected by a number of factors, including any potential reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, including tangible and intangible assets, the resulting tax effects of differing tax rates in different state jurisdictions, changes in transfer pricing rules or methods of applying these rules, and changes in tax laws in various jurisdictions. While we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, which, if resolved unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes and our payment obligation with respect to any such taxes.\nOur business operates in regulated industries.\nOur current and anticipated service offerings operate in industries, such as home security, that are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we may be required to obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards or licensing requirements in the conduct of our business. The loss of such licenses or permits or the imposition of conditions to the granting or retention of such licenses or permits could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses for us or our partners. If laws and regulations were to change, or if we or our products and services were deemed not to comply with them, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, any of which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions, any of which could render more difficult, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, on August 21, 2019, our Board acted to preserve the potential benefits of our NOLs from being limited pursuant to Section 382 of the Code by adopting a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the \u201cSection 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan\u201d). The principal reason our Board adopted the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is that we believe that the NOLs are a potentially valuable asset and the Board believes it is in the Company\u2019s best interests to attempt to protect this asset by preventing the imposition of limitations on their use. While the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is not principally intended to prevent a takeover, it does have a potential anti-takeover effect because an \u201cacquiring person\u201d thereunder may be diluted upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Accordingly, the overall effects of the Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan may be to render more difficult, or discourage merger, tender offer, or assumption of control by a substantial holder of our securities.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited.\nWe have federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income. We may recognize additional NOLs in the future. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation's NOLs if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when our \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nIf an ownership change occurs, the amount of the taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by a pre-change loss is subject to an annual limitation that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. This limitation is derived by multiplying the fair market value of our stock as of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate. To the extent that a company has a net unrealized built-in gain at the time of an ownership change, which is realized or deemed recognized during the five-year period following the ownership change, there is an increase in the annual limitation for each of the first five-years that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. If an ownership change should occur in the future, our ability to use the NOL to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income generated by us in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL and we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL that may not be realized, which could impact our result of operations.\nAs noted, we believe that these NOL carryforwards are a valuable asset for us. Consequently, we have a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in place, to protect our NOLs during the effective period of the rights plan. Although the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change\u201d. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our Company or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. The foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88468, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SPRT"}
