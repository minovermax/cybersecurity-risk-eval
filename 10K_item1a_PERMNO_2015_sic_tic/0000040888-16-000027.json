{"cik": "40888", "company": "AEROJET ROCKETDYNE HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nFuture reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We are seeing more opportunities for commercial in-launch and in-space business. In addition, sales to our aerospace and defense customers that provide products to international customers continue to grow. However, we continue to rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in a large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. President must propose and Congress must appropriate funds for a given program each GFY and may significantly change, increase, reduce or eliminate, funding for a program.\nA decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nThe cancellation or material modification of one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our financial results.\nSales, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. government and its agencies accounted for approximately 90% of our total net sales in fiscal 2015. Our contracts typically permit the U.S. government to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination.\nIn addition, termination or suspension of any of our significant commercial contracts could result in the loss of future sales and unreimbursable expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Furthermore, the termination of any such contracts for default could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and ability to obtain new business in the future.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. government.\nU.S. government agencies, including the DCAA and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The U.S. government also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. Any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nWe have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties.\nAs described in greater detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we restated our consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2013 and 2014 and our unaudited quarterly financial information for the first three quarters in fiscal 2015 and each of the quarters in fiscal 2014 (collectively, the \u201cRestated Periods\u201d). Management concluded that, as a result of the identified material weaknesses, our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of November 30, 2015. The determination to restate the financial statements for the Restated Periods was made by our Audit Committee and management after discussions with the Company\u2019s independent public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Our Audit Committee concluded that our previously issued financial statements for the Restated Periods should no longer be relied upon. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes the restatement of our financial statements for the Restated Periods (the \u201cRestatement\u201d).\nAs a result of these events, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the Restatement and the remediation of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. As further described in Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, the Company and certain of our officers and a former officer have been named as defendants in a lawsuit as a result of the Restatement. Other plaintiffs may bring additional actions with other claims based on the Restatement and we could be subject to additional stockholder, governmental, or other actions in connection with the Restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in the pending litigation or any other proceedings, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, the Restatement and related matters and the pending litigation could impair our reputation or could cause a loss of investor confidence. Each of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price.\nThe estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates and judgments include those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, purchase accounting, assumptions in the valuation of stock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and judgments, or the assumptions underlying them, may change over time or prove inaccurate. If the estimates or judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary materially from those reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which may subject us to a number of additional costs and risks.\nFor example, in February 2016, we restated our consolidated financial statements for certain prior periods. For a further discussion of this restatement, see the foregoing discussion in the risk factor captioned \u201cWe have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties.\u201d\nIf we experience cost overruns on our contracts, we would have to absorb the excess costs which could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to win new contracts.\nIn fiscal 2015, approximately 61% of our Aerospace and Defense net sales were from fixed-price contracts, most of which are in mature production mode. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a fixed price and realize all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in the costs of performing the contract. As a result, all fixed-price contracts involve the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. To the extent we were to incur unanticipated cost overruns on\na program or platform subject to a fixed-price contract, our profitability would be adversely affected. Future profitability is subject to risks including the ability of suppliers to deliver components of acceptable quality on schedule and the successful implementation of automated tooling in production processes.\nIn fiscal 2015, approximately 33% of our Aerospace and Defense net sales were from cost reimbursable contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we agree to be reimbursed for allowable costs and be paid a fee. If our costs are in excess of the final target cost, fees and our margin may be adversely affected. If our costs exceed authorized contract funding or they do not qualify as allowable costs under applicable regulations, we will not be reimbursed for those costs. Cost overruns may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract performance and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers and on suppliers to provide raw materials and component parts for our contract performance. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.\nOur success and growth in our Aerospace and Defense segment depends on our ability to execute long-standing programs and periodically secure new contracts in a competitive environment.\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s revenue is primarily derived from long-standing contracts (often sole source) where Aerojet Rocketdyne is the long-term incumbent. The challenge for Aerojet Rocketdyne is to successfully utilize its technical, engineering, manufacturing, and management skills to execute these programs for the customer, to continue to innovate and refine its solutions, and to offer the customer increasing affordability in an era of fiscal restraint. If Aerojet Rocketdyne is unable to successfully execute these long-standing programs, our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers may be impaired.\nIn addition, in sectors where there is competition, it can be intense. For example, we face increasing competition from entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities which are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and our manufacturing methodologies. The U.S. government also has its own manufacturing capabilities in some areas. We may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors and our inability to do so could result in a decrease in sales, profits, and cash flows that we historically have generated from certain contracts. Further, the U.S. government may open to competition programs on which we are currently the sole supplier, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur Aerospace and Defense segment is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations inherent in contracting with the U.S. government, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn the performance of contracts with the U.S. government, we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the DCAA. These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting system. Any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. If such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThese laws and regulations provide for ongoing audits and reviews of incurred costs as well as contract procurement, performance and administration. The U.S. government may, if it deems appropriate, conduct an investigation into possible illegal or unethical activity in connection with these contracts. Investigations of this nature are common in the aerospace and defense industry, and lawsuits may result. In addition, the U.S. government and its principal prime contractors periodically investigate the financial viability of their contractors and subcontractors as part of its risk assessment process associated with the award of new contracts. If the U.S. government or one or more prime contractors were to determine that we were not financially viable, our ability to continue to act as a government contractor or subcontractor would be impaired.\nAerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s international sales are subject to applicable laws relating to export controls, the violation of which could adversely affect its operations.\nA portion of the Aerojet Rocketdyne activities is subject to export control regulation by the U.S. Department of State under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d). The export of certain defense-related products, hardware, software, services and technical data is regulated by the State Department\u2019s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (\u201cDTCC\u201d) under ITAR. DTCC administers the State Department\u2019s authority under ITAR to impose civil penalties and other administrative sanctions for violations, including debarment from engaging in the export of defense articles or defense services. Violations of ITAR could result in significant sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of the Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s international business.\nBy virtue of recent U.S. export control reform, certain Aerojet Rocketdyne international sales that were under Department of State jurisdiction are now regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) under the Export Administration Act and the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), specifically those sales involving controlled U.S.-origin commodities with restrictions as to certain end uses, end users or destinations. BIS addresses administrative or criminal enforcement of EAR violations. Similar to penalties and sanctions in violation of ITAR, BIS evaluates violations based upon factors which include destination of the export, degree of willfulness involved in the violation and specific factors of mitigation or aggravation. The range of penalties is similar to those discussed above with regard to ITAR violations.\nIn November 2011, DTCC informed UTC that it considers certain of UTC\u2019s voluntary disclosures filed since 2005 to reflect deficiencies warranting penalties and sanctions. On June 28, 2012, UTC entered into a Consent Agreement (the \u201cUTC Consent Agreement\u201d) with DTCC to resolve a Proposed Charging Letter that references approximately 45 of UTC\u2019s previous disclosures. The UTC Consent Agreement, which applies to the Rocketdyne Business, has a four-year term, and provides that UTC will: (1) pay a civil penalty of up to $55 million; (2) appoint, subject to DTCC approval, an outside special compliance official to oversee the compliance by UTC and its subsidiaries and divisions, including the Rocketdyne Business, with the UTC Consent Agreement and ITAR; (3) continue and undertake additional remedial actions to strengthen ITAR compliance, with emphasis on human resources and organization, training, automation, and security of electronic data; and (4) sponsor two outside ITAR compliance audits for UTC and its subsidiaries and divisions, including the Rocketdyne Business, during the term of the UTC Consent Agreement.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, the DTCC agreed to release the Rocketdyne Business from the UTC Consent Agreement upon consummation of the Acquisition on the condition that we agreed to provide to the DTCC (i) our plan to integrate the Rocketdyne Business into our ITAR compliance program and (ii) an audit of the integration one year after closing the Acquisition. Further, UTC has agreed to reimburse us for any and all costs we incur to comply with these requirements. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we provided to the DTCC a letter committing to the DTCC\u2019s conditions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating the Rocketdyne Business into our ITAR and EAR compliance programs or to prevent any further ITAR violations. Therefore, a future violation of ITAR or EAR could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitive improvement program (\u201cCIP\u201d) may not be successful in aligning our operations to current market conditions.\nIn March 2015, we initiated the CIP comprised of activities and initiatives aimed at reducing costs in order for us to continue to compete successfully. The company-wide initiative is being undertaken after a comprehensive assessment of our product portfolio to underpin Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s technological and competitive leadership in our markets through continued research and development. The CIP is composed of three major components: (i) facilities optimization and footprint reduction; (ii) product affordability; and (iii) reduced administrative and overhead costs. Implementation of the CIP involves reductions in our workforce and facilities and, in certain instances, the relocation of products, technologies and personnel. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenditures to implement the CIP and we expect to realize significant future cost savings as a result. The CIP may not be successful in achieving these cost savings and other benefits within the expected timeframes, may be insufficient to successfully restructure our operations through, among other ways, the relocation of programs or the inability to transition institutional program knowledge, to conform with the changes affecting our industry, may disrupt our operations, or may be more costly than currently anticipated. See additional information in Note 12 in notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may expand our operations through acquisitions, which may divert management\u2019s attention and expose us to unanticipated liabilities and costs. Also, acquisitions may increase our non-reimbursable costs. We may experience difficulties integrating any acquired operations, and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are never consummated.\nOur business strategy may lead us to expand our Aerospace and Defense segment through acquisitions. However, our ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by government regulations, the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources, and our ability to obtain financing. Our success in\nintegrating newly acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of management\u2019s attention from operational matters, integrate general and administrative services and key information processing systems and, where necessary, re-qualify our customer programs. In addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs, and/or contingent liabilities. We may also incur costs and divert management attention to acquisitions that are never consummated. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated.\nAlthough we undertake a due diligence investigation of each business that we have acquired or may acquire, there may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to, or were unable to, discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. In connection with acquisitions, we generally seek to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through indemnities and warranties from the seller. However, these indemnities and warranties, if obtained, may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope, amount or duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor, or other reasons.\nOur inability to adapt to rapid technological changes could impair our ability to remain competitive.\nThe aerospace and defense industry continues to undergo rapid and significant technological development. Our competitors may implement new technologies before us, allowing them to provide more effective products at more competitive prices. Future technological developments could:\n\u2022\nadversely impact our competitive position if we are unable to react to these developments in a timely or efficient manner;\n\u2022\nrequire us to write-down obsolete facilities, equipment, and technology;\n\u2022\nrequire us to discontinue production of obsolete products before we can recover any or all of our related research, development and commercialization expenses; or\n\u2022\nrequire significant capital expenditures for research, development, and launch of new products or processes.\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face cyber threats, insider threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters, or public health crises.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement.\nPrior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, however this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber security assessment analyses undertaken by us identified and prioritized steps to enhance our cyber security safeguards. We are in the process of implementing these recommendations to enhance our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures. Despite the implementation of these new safeguards, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protecting our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face.\nThe DoD and NASA have contract provisions that require contractors at the prime and subcontract level to comply with Safeguarding of Unclassified Controlled Technical Information in accordance with their agency guidelines. These clauses are being inserted in or made applicable to government contracts and non-compliance may impact our ability to receive contracts if we cannot comply or use alternative approaches to comply with the contract information security requirements.\nWe may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price; or such events could result in the loss of\ncompetitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property, early obsolescence of our products and services, or contractual penalties.\nWe may experience warranty claims for product failures, schedule delays or other problems with existing or new products and systems.\nMany of the products we develop and manufacture are technologically advanced systems that must function under demanding operating conditions. Even though we believe that we employ sophisticated and rigorous design, manufacturing and testing processes and practices, we may not be able to successfully launch or manufacture our products on schedule or our products may not perform as intended.\nIf our products fail to perform adequately, some of our contracts require us to forfeit a portion of our expected profit, receive reduced payments, provide a replacement product or service or reduce the price of subsequent sales to the same customer. Performance penalties may also be imposed if we fail to meet delivery schedules or other measures of contract performance. We do not generally insure against potential costs resulting from any required remedial actions or costs or loss of sales due to postponement or cancellation of scheduled operations or product deliveries.\nThe release or explosion of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business operations involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials and other dangerous chemicals, including materials used in rocket propulsion and explosive devices. Despite our use of specialized facilities to handle dangerous materials and intensive employee training programs, the handling and production of hazardous materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our manufacturing operations and could cause production delays. It is possible that a release of these chemicals or an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and others. Material property damage to us and third parties could also occur. The use of these products in applications by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion or fire were to occur. Any release or explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials, difficulties in the supplier qualification process or increases in prices of raw materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe use a significant quantity of raw materials that are subject to market fluctuations and government regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. Although to-date we have been successful in establishing replacement materials and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs, we may be unable to continue to do so.\nThe supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The completion of the Space Shuttle Program reduced demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. In addition, the sole domestic source is evaluating strategic alternatives to its business; accordingly, we are evaluating alternate sources of supply to mitigate risks. In the majority of our contracts, we anticipated this price increase and incorporated abnormal escalation pricing language into our proposals and contracts.\nWe are also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts, particularly on multi-year programs. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the \u201cBerry Amendment\u201d which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote \u201cprice in effect\u201d at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to our programs.\nProlonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur pension plans are currently underfunded and we expect to be required to make cash contributions in future periods, which may reduce the cash available for our businesses.\nAs of the last measurement date at November 30, 2015, our total defined benefit pension plan assets, total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for the tax-qualified pension plans were approximately $964.1 million,\n$1,549.5 million, and $566.2 million, respectively. We expect to make cash contributions of approximately $23 million to our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2016. We estimate that approximately 83% of our unfunded pension obligation as of November 30, 2015 is related to Aerojet Rocketdyne which will be recoverable through our U.S. government contracts.\nThe funded status of our pension plans may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans\u2019 assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plans\u2019 assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plans could be higher than we expect.\nAdditionally, the level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation such as the new mortality tables, and other factors affects our financial results. The timing of recognition of pension expense or income in our financial statements differs from the timing of the required pension funding under the Pension Protection Act (\"PPA\") or the amount of funding that can be recorded in our overhead rates through our U.S. government contracting business. Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans.\nThe level of returns on retirement benefit assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affects our financial results.\nOur earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee retirement benefit plans. We calculate the expense for the plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions that we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key assumptions used to estimate retirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our pension expense or income can also be affected by legislation and other government regulatory actions.\nAlthough some of our environmental expenditures may be recoverable and we have established reserves, given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may not be sufficient, which could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nAs of November 30, 2015, the aggregate range of our estimated future environmental obligations was $306.1 million to $457.4 million and the accrued amount was $306.1 million. We believe the accrued amount for future remediation costs represents the costs that could be incurred by us over the contractual term, if any, or the next fifteen years of the estimated remediation, to the extent they are probable and reasonably estimable. However, in many cases the nature and extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. We evaluate the adequacy of those reserves on a quarterly basis, and adjust them as appropriate. In addition, the reserves are based only on known sites and the known contamination at those sites. It is possible that additional sites needing remediation may be identified or that unknown contamination at previously identified sites may be discovered. It is also possible that the regulatory agencies may change clean-up standards for chemicals of concern such as ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene. This could lead to additional expenditures for environmental remediation in the future and, given the uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient.\nMost of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government and allocable to Northrop until the cumulative expenditure limitation is reached. We currently estimate approximately 24% of our Aerospace and Defense segment environmental costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur environmental expenses related to non-Aerojet Rocketdyne sites are generally not recoverable and a significant increase in these estimated environmental expenses could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur operations and properties are currently the subject of significant environmental liabilities, and the numerous environmental and other government requirements to which we are subject may become more stringent in the future.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that, among other things, require us to obtain permits to operate and install pollution control equipment and regulate the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. These requirements may become more stringent in the future. Additional regulations dictate how and to what level we remediate contaminated soils and the level to which we are required to clean contaminated groundwater. These requirements may also become more stringent in the future. We may also be subject to fines and penalties relating to the operation of our existing and formerly owned businesses. We have been and are subject to toxic tort and asbestos lawsuits as well as other third-party lawsuits, due to either our past or present use of hazardous substances or the alleged on-site or off-site contamination of the environment through past or present operations. We may incur material costs in defending these\nclaims and lawsuits and any similar claims and lawsuits that may arise in the future. Contamination at our current and former properties is subject to investigation and remediation requirements under federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the full extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Any adverse judgment or cash outlay could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe are from time to time subject to significant litigation, the outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to material litigation. We may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be very costly and can divert management\u2019s efforts. Adverse outcomes in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to developing and manufacturing propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems, and munitions applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nOur inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses\u2019 prospects and competitive positions.\nWe seek to protect proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. In addition, we may incur significant expense in protecting our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may be breached and remedies for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information. Other parties may independently develop our know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect us.\nOur business may be affected by disruptions including, but not limited to: threats to physical security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives; terrorist acts; information technology attacks or failures; damaging weather or other acts of nature; and pandemics or other public health crises. The costs related to these events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIf our operating subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow or if they are not able to pay dividends or otherwise distribute their cash to us, or if we have insufficient funds on hand, we may not be able to service our debt.\nAll of the operations of our Aerospace and Defense and Real Estate segments are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations will be largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these subsidiaries to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend upon their operating results and cash flows and will be subject to applicable laws and any contractual restrictions contained in the agreements governing their debt, if any.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. Our ability to operate is limited by the agreements governing our debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2015, we had $652.0 million of debt. Subject to the limits contained in some of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, we may incur additional debt in the future. Our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur level of debt places significant demands on our cash resources, which could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash for payments related to our debt, reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, entitlement of our real estate assets, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and fund our operating costs, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants outlined in our debt indentures and agreements that could restrict our operating activities. A failure to comply could result in a default under our amended senior credit facility entered into on May 30, 2014 (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d) with the lenders identified therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, which would, if not waived by the lenders which likely would come with substantial cost, accelerate the payment of our debt. A payment default under the Senior Credit Facility could result in cross defaults on our 7 1/8% Notes, 4 1/16% Debentures and subordinated credit facility.\nOur debt instruments generally contain various restrictive covenants which include, among others, provisions which may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\naccess the full amount of our revolving credit facility and/or incur additional debt;\n\u2022\nenter into certain leases;\n\u2022\nmake certain distributions, investments, and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncause our restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\npurchase assets or businesses;\n\u2022\nsell assets and, if sold, retain excess cash flow from these sales; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur secured debt also contains other customary covenants, including, among others, provisions:\n\u2022\nrelating to the maintenance of the property collateralizing the debt; and\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens.\nIn addition, certain covenants in our bank facility require that we maintain certain financial ratios.\nBased on our existing debt agreements, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of November 30, 2015. Any of the covenants described in this risk factor may restrict our operations and our ability to pursue potentially advantageous business opportunities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the Senior Credit Facility, the Subordinated Credit Facility, the 7 1/8% Notes, and the 4 1/16% Debentures. In addition, our failure to pay principal and interest when due is a default under the Senior Credit Facility, and in certain cases, would cause cross defaults on the subordinated credit facility, 7 1/8% Notes and 4 1/16% Debentures.\nThe real estate market involves significant risk, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur real estate activities involve significant risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to various risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary re-zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to complete environmental remediation or to have state and federal environmental restrictions on our property lifted, which could cause a delay or abandonment of these projects;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain sufficient water sources to service our projects, which may prevent us from executing our plans;\n\u2022\nour real estate activities may require significant expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us unable to proceed with our plans;\n\u2022\neconomic and political uncertainties could have an adverse effect on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general;\n\u2022\nour property is subject to federal, state, and local regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our plans;\n\u2022\nmuch of our property is raw land that includes the natural habitats of various endangered or protected wildlife species requiring mitigation;\n\u2022\nif our land use plans are approved by the appropriate governmental authorities, we may face lawsuits from those who oppose such plans. Such lawsuits and the costs associated with such opposition could be material and have an adverse effect on our ability to sell property or realize income from our projects; and\n\u2022\nthe time frame required for approval of our plans means that we will have to wait years for a significant cash return.\nSubstantially all of our excess real estate, that we are in the process of entitling for new opportunities, is located in Sacramento County, California, making us vulnerable to changes in economic and other conditions in that particular market.\nAs a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, our long-term real estate performance and the value of our properties will depend upon conditions in the Sacramento region, including:\n\u2022\nthe sustainability and growth of industries located in the Sacramento region;\n\u2022\nthe financial strength and spending of the State of California;\n\u2022\nlocal real estate market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in neighborhood characteristics;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nreal estate tax rates.\nIf unfavorable economic or other conditions continue in the region, our plans and business strategy could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional costs related to past or future divestitures, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn connection with our divestitures we have incurred and may incur additional costs. As part of these and other divestitures, we have provided customary indemnification to the purchasers for such matters as claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, including income tax matters and the liability to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination existing prior to disposition. These additional costs and the indemnification of the purchasers of our former or current businesses may require additional cash expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract and retain key employees.\nOur business has a continuing need to attract large numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding security clearances, to support the growth of the enterprise and to replace individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. In addition, our inability to appropriately plan for the transfer or replacement of appropriate intellectual capital and skill sets critical to us could result in business disruptions and impair our ability to achieve business objectives.\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of November 30, 2015, 15% of our 4,823 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate acceptable new agreements with the unions, upon expiration of the existing contracts, we could experience a strike or work stoppage. Even if we are successful in negotiating new agreements, the new agreements could call for higher wages or benefits paid to union members, which would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our profitability. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor\ncosts. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on us.\nDue to the nature of our business, our sales levels may fluctuate causing our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual sales are affected by a variety of factors that may lead to significant variability in our operating results. In our Aerospace and Defense segment, sales earned under long-term contracts are recognized either on a cost basis, when deliveries are made, or when contractually defined performance milestones are achieved. The timing of deliveries or milestones may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. In our Real Estate segment, sales of property may be made from time to time, which may result in variability in our operating results and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls due to the following matters: (i) we did not adequately design controls related to purchase accounting considerations for long-term customer contracts acquired as part of a business combination and (ii) we did not maintain effective controls over the integration of the Company\u2019s accounting policies, practices and controls applicable to the acquired Rocketdyne Business, including those over the segmentation criteria applicable to long-term contracts. As a result of these material weaknesses, errors occurred in several significant accounts in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements that were not detected. The areas most affected by these deficiencies include net sales, costs of sales, depreciation expense, inventory, accounts receivable, goodwill, property, plant and equipment, net and income taxes. Due to these material weaknesses, management believes that as of November 30, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission criteria. We have and will continue to implement various initiatives in fiscal 2016 to improve our internal controls over financial reporting and address the matters discussed in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The implementation of the initiatives and the consideration of additional necessary improvements are among our highest priorities. Management will continually assess the progress of the initiatives and the improvements, and take further actions as deemed necessary. In addition, management will report such progress to the Board of Directors, under the direction of the Audit Committee. Until the identified material weaknesses are eliminated, there is a risk of a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results.\nIn addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, revisions or out of period adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. In making such adjustments we apply the analytical framework of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, \u201cMateriality\u201d (\u201cSAB 99\u201d), to determine whether the effect of any adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is material and whether such adjustments, individually or in the aggregate, would require us to restate our consolidated financial statements for previous periods. Under SAB 99, companies are required to apply quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the \u201cmateriality\u201d of particular adjustments. We have previously revised our quarterly financial information in fiscal 2014 and recorded out of period items in other prior periods. In the future, we may identify further errors impacting our interim or annual consolidated financial statements. Depending upon the complete qualitative and quantitative analysis, this could result in us restating previously issued consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 20765, "SIC": 3760, "TIC": "AJRD"}
