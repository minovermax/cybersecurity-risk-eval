{"cik": "719274", "company": "GIGA TRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFuture liquidity is uncertain\nWe incurred net losses of $4.1 million in fiscal 2016, and $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $24.0 million as of March 26, 2016.\nBeginning in fiscal 2012, we invested substantially in the research and development of our new product line, ASG. We anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the ASG platform, but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. We also experienced delays in the development of features, orders, and shipments for the new ASG. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $3.0 million at March 28, 2015, to $1.8 million at March 26, 2016. The new Advanced Signal Generator product has now shipped to several customers, but potential delays in the development of features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to continue shipments in volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses. The losses in fiscal 2016 caused working capital restraints, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers.\nThese matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d (Note 2, Going Concern and Management\u2019s Plan).\nCustomer orders and production of new product platform\nWe invested heavily in the development of our new ASG product platform but delays in completing it have contributed to our losses. Longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.\nAbility to stay listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market\nOur Common Stock is current listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ has minimum requirements that a Company must meet in order to remain listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. These requirements include maintaining a minimum shareholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million. If our shareholders\u2019 equity falls below $2.5 million, NASDAQ could delist us from the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our Common Stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our Common Stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our Common Stock could decrease. If our Common Stock ceases to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we expect that our Common Stock would be traded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on or about the same day.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry\nWe have a significant number of defense-related orders. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Our product backlog has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards\nThe market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 common stock price is volatile\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, NASDAQ and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Sales of a significant volume of stock could result in a decline of our share price.\nPerformance problems in Giga-tronics\u2019 products or problems arising from the use of its products together with other vendors\u2019 products may harm its business and reputation\nProducts as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.\nGiga-tronics\u2019 competition has greater resources\nOur instrument, switch, oscillator and synthesizer products compete with Agilent/Keysight, Anritsu, and Rohde & Schwarz. All of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.", "PERMNO": 39029, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "GIGA"}
