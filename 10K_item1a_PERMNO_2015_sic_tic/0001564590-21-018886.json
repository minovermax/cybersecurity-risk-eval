Our business and results of operations could be materially affected by any of the following risks. The factors discussed herein are not exhaustive. Therefore, the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports that we file with the SEC from time to time, which may supplement, modify, supersede, or update the factors listed in this document. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\u2022\nOur business is dependent on customers\u2019 continued spending on video solutions and services. A reduction in spending by customers would adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nOur efforts to introduce SaaS-based multiscreen service offerings may either not succeed or impair the sale of our on-site licensed offerings, the occurrence of either of which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to respond to rapidly changing technologies related to multiscreen video, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected because the competitive advantage of our products and services relative to those of our competitors would decrease.\n\u2022\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, which could have long-term negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand.\n\u2022\nBecause our customer base has been highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, the loss of reduced demand by, or the return of product by one or more of these customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nCancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or final customer acceptance could cause a substantial variation in our operating results, resulting in a decrease in the market price of our common stock and making period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.\n\u2022\nAdoption of our value based selling approach for our products and services may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.\n\u2022\nDue to the lengthy sales cycle involved in the sale of our products, our quarterly results may vary and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.\n\u2022\nIf there were a decline in demand or average selling prices for our products and services, our revenue and operating results would be materially affected.\n\u2022\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\n\u2022\nIf our software products contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced turnover in our senior management, which could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and could hinder the execution of our growth strategy.\n\u2022\nRestructuring programs could have a material negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nIf our indefinite-lived or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\n\u2022\nThe recent COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third-Parties\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to obtain necessary licenses, services or distribution rights for third-party technology at acceptable prices, or at all, our products could become obsolete or we may not be able to deliver certain product offerings.\n\u2022\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities or our enterprise cloud computing providers could impair the delivery of our service, adversely affect our financial results and otherwise harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur products are often integrated with other third-party products. Third-party delays could adversely affect our future financial operating results.\n\u2022\nOur ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our third-party vendors.\n\u2022\nBecause we purchase certain components used in assembling some of our products from sole suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a failure of these suppliers to provide these components.\n\u2022\nA disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations and impact our revenue and profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022\nWe operate in a relatively new and rapidly developing market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies and services in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries, our business could decline.\n\u2022\nOur future success is dependent on the manner in which the multiscreen video and OTT markets develop, and if these markets develop in a manner that does not facilitate inclusion of our products and services, our business may not continue to grow.\n\u2022\nIf content providers limit the scope of content licensed for use in the digital VOD and OTT market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected because the potential market for our products would be more limited than we currently believe and have communicated to the financial markets.\n\u2022\nThere is no assurance that the current cost of Internet connectivity and network access will not rise with the increasing popularity of online media services.\n\u2022\nWe have been and, in the future, could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\n\u2022\nThe success of our business model could be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment, such as changes that either would limit capital expenditures by television, cable or telecommunications operators or reverse the trend towards deregulation in the industries in which we compete.\n\u2022\nUncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nEvolving data privacy regulations, including the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), may subject us to significant penalties.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and our failure to comply could result in penalties that could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\n\u2022\nWe may not fully realize the benefits of our completed acquisitions or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits. Future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\n\u2022\nWe face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product, which could harm our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.\n\u2022\nBecause our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations, we may not be able to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business is dependent on customers\u2019 continued spending on video solutions and services. A reduction in spending by customers would adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 continued spending for video solutions and services. Spending for these systems and services is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of spending, and, therefore, our sales and profits, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; customer specific financial or stock market conditions;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\ndemand for services;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other providers of video solutions and services;\n\u2022\nacceptance by our customers; and\n\u2022\nreal or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors.\nAny reduction in spending by our customers would adversely affect our business. We continue to have limited visibility into the capital spending plans of our current and prospective customers. Fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results. Our planned expense levels depend in part on our expectations of future revenue. Our planned expenses include significant investments, particularly within our research and development organization, which we believe are necessary to continue to provide innovative solutions to meet our current and prospective customers\u2019 needs. As a result, it is difficult to forecast revenue and operating results. If our revenue and operating results are below the expectations of our investors and market analysts, it could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur efforts to introduce SaaS-based multiscreen service offerings may either not succeed or impair the sale of our on-site licensed offerings, the occurrence of either of which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have devoted, and will continue to devote, considerable resources, including the allocation of capital expenditures to growing our SaaS service offering revenue over the next several years. There can be no assurance that we will meet our revenue targets for this service and if we fail to achieve our revenue goals, our growth and operating results will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, new or existing customers may choose to purchase our SaaS services rather than our on-premise solutions. If our customers\u2019 purchases trend away from perpetual licenses toward our SaaS, or to the extent customers defer orders due to evaluation of SaaS, our product revenue, and our timing of revenue generally, may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions.\nOur efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions may result in a reduction in both the range of products and services we offer and in the range of our current and potential future customers. Each of these factors may increase the level of execution risk in our strategy, in that there may be increased variability in our revenue. If we are unsuccessful in this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nIf we are unable to successfully compete in our marketplace, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe currently compete against companies offering video software solutions and have increasingly seen competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and a large number of OTT players. To the extent the products developed are competitive with and not complementary to our products, they may be more cost-effective than our solutions, which could result in cable television system operators and telecommunications companies discontinuing their purchases of our on-demand products. Due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete, additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources, such as in-house solutions and online video platforms, may enter those markets, thereby further intensifying competition. Increased competition could result in price reductions, cancellations of purchase orders, losses of business with current customers to competitors, and loss of market share which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, selling and marketing, technical and other resources than we do. They may be in better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. Moreover, our competitors may also foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do. Although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, realizing and maintaining these advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and product development, marketing and customer service and support. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected because of the difference in our operating results from the assumptions on which our business model is based.\nIf we fail to respond to rapidly changing technologies related to multiscreen video, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected because the competitive advantage of our products and services relative to those of our competitors would decrease.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Future technological advances in the television and video industries may result in the availability of new products or services that could compete with the solutions provided by us or reduce the cost of existing products or services, any of which could enable our existing or potential customers to fulfill their video needs better and more cost efficiently than with our products. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing video products, including the development of new applications for our technology, and to develop and introduce new products to meet and adapt to changing customer requirements and emerging technologies such as the OTT market. In the future, we may not be successful in enhancing our video products or developing and marketing new products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, there may be services, products or technologies developed by others that render our products or technologies uncompetitive, unmarketable or obsolete, or announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings either by us or our competitors that cause customers to defer or fail to purchase our existing solutions.\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, which could have long-term negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand.\nWe have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, including due to the impact of worldwide economic cycles, to increase average revenue per unit of our sales and to reduce our operating expenses, rationalize capital expenditure and minimize customer turnover. These measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions by outsourcing and off-shoring, implementing cost reduction programs and reducing and rationalizing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. We cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and services, to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete, to operate effectively, to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand. These measures may have long-term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and services, making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle.\nBecause our customer base has been highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, the loss of reduced demand by, or the return of product by one or more of these customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, and, therefore, a limited number of customers account for a significant percentage of our revenue in any fiscal period. Our sales to specific customers tend to vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter depending upon these customers\u2019 budgets for capital expenditures and our new product introductions. We believe that a significant amount of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers in the future. The loss of, reduced demand for products or related services by, or return of a product previously purchased by any of our major customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could materially and adversely affect, either in a particular quarter or on a more long-term basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nA portion of our business is subscription-based and as we seek to accelerate our penetration in OTT and serving new market segments with a SaaS revenue model, we will expand our subscription-based model. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and we will experience losses of customers that elect not to renew, in some cases, for reasons beyond our control. Even if subscriptions are renewed, they may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to retain our existing customers and grow depends in part on subscription renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates have and may continue to fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the cost of our services and the cost of services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers\u2019 and their end users\u2019 spending levels or the introduction by competitors of attractive features and functionality. If our customer retention rate decreases, we may need to increase the rate at which we add new customers in order to maintain and grow our revenue, which may require us to incur significantly higher sales and marketing expenses than we currently anticipate, or our revenue may decline. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed or affected. Our Framework subscription model was introduced in fiscal 2020 and as such we do not have historical renewal data to rely on to help us predict our future renewal rates and we will not have relevant renewal data for a number of years.\nCancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or final customer acceptance could cause a substantial variation in our operating results, resulting in a decrease in the market price of our common stock and making period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from purchase orders that have exceeded one million dollars in value. A significant cancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or receiving final customer acceptance could result in a substantial variation in our operating results in any particular quarter due to the resulting decrease in revenue and gross margin. In addition, to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected, operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected because our operating costs and expenses are based, in part, on our expectations of future revenue, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall. Because of these factors, in some future quarter our operating results may be below guidance that we may issue or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, either of which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, these factors may make period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.\nAdoption of our value based selling approach for our products and services may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.\nIn February 2019, we began providing our products and services to customers on the basis of our value based selling approach, under which customers would license our products and services. If we do not correctly understand the magnitude of expenses we will incur in connection with these new agreements, our operating results would be\nmaterially affected. In addition, our revenues may be adversely affected if the new approach results in a delay in our ability to recognize revenue, in which case our revenues and operating results would be materially affected.\nDue to the lengthy sales cycle involved in the sale of our products, our quarterly results may vary and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.\nOur software products and related services are relatively complex and their purchase generally involves a significant commitment of capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and implementation procedures within an organization. Moreover, the purchase of these products typically requires coordination and agreement among a potential customer\u2019s corporate headquarters and its regional and local operations. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our software products and services is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks, including customers\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews, over which we have little or no control. Based upon all of the foregoing, we believe that our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future, that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.\nIf there were a decline in demand or average selling prices for our products and services, our revenue and operating results would be materially affected.\nA decline in demand or average selling prices for our products or services in the foreseeable future, whether as a result of new product introductions by others, price competition, technological change, inability to enhance the products in a timely fashion, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increasingly, we are seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and a large number of OTT players, each of which may reduce the demand for or average selling prices of our products and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\nWhile firm fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenue. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we will recognize a loss, which can significantly affect our reported results. The long-term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenue on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, our related margin could be reduced. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur products are subject to warranty claims.\nWe sell our products with warranties as to the products\u2019 performance in accordance with standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. There can be no assurance that the provision in our financial statements for estimated product warranty expense will be sufficient. We cannot ensure you that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant occurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we provide maintenance support to our customers and allocate a portion of the product purchase price to the initial warranty period and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over that warranty period related to both the warranty obligation and the maintenance support agreement. We cannot be sure that the cost of such maintenance support will be adequately provided for in our financial statements and any additional maintenance expenses could likewise have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nIf our software products contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.\nComplex software applications such as ours often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite internal testing and testing by our customers, our current and future products may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue, lost customers, slower growth or a delay in market acceptance.\nSince our customers use our products for critical business applications, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. These errors and defects could result in product liability, services level agreement claims or warranty claims. Although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims, including warranty disclaimers, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. Even if not successful, a claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our products and/or collect payment from our customers.\nWe have experienced turnover in our senior management, which could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and could hinder the execution of our growth strategy.\nWe have recently experienced turnover in our senior management. Mr. Yossi Aloni resigned as Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) in January 2021 upon which Mr. Robert Pons was appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Aloni had been appointed as CEO and President in August of 2019. Chad Hassler, our Chief Commercial Officer, also resigned in January 2021. Further, the longest serving member of our board was elected in 2019. Lack of management continuity could harm our customer relationships, delay product development processes, adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy, result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, and could impede our ability to recruit new talented individuals to senior management positions, which could adversely impact our results of operations, stock price and customer relationships. Our success largely depends on our ability to integrate any new senior management within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key positions may affect our financial performance and results of operations as new members of management become familiar with our business.\nRestructuring programs could have a material negative impact on our business.\nTo increase strategic focus and operational efficiency we have implemented restructuring programs. In fiscal 2019, we implemented a cost restructuring program, the primary element of which was staff reductions across all of our functions and geographic areas. In fiscal 2020, we continued to streamline our operations and closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands for which we realized annualized costs savings of $6.0 million. In fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for which we expect additional annualized cost savings of $7.6 million. We also transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in fiscal 2021 in an effort to further reduce cost. As a result of these restructuring efforts, our total number of employees significantly decreased. We may incur additional restructuring costs or not realize the expected benefits of these new initiatives. Further, we could experience delays, business disruptions, decreased productivity, unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation-related costs in connection with past and future restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of the savings achievable by restructuring will be realized. As a result, our restructuring and our related cost reduction activities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nActions that may be taken by significant stockholders may divert the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management from our business operations.\nCampaigns by significant investors to effect changes at publicly-traded companies continue to be prevalent. There can be no assurance that one or more current or future stockholders will not pursue actions to effect changes in our management and strategic direction, including through the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders. If a proxy contest were to be pursued by a stockholder, it could result in substantial expense to us, consume significant attention of our management and Board of Directors, and disrupt our business. On February 28, 2019, we entered into the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, we appointed both Robert Pons and Jeffrey Tuder to our Board. Certain of our significant stockholders expressed disagreement with the Cooperation Agreement and it is possible that some of our stockholders may conduct a \u201cvote no\u201d campaign against the election of all or certain of our board members standing for election at our upcoming annual meeting of\nstockholders and cause the Board to consider the resignation of any candidate who does not achieve the support of a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election. Similar to a proxy contest, this could result in substantial expense to us, consume significant attention of our management and Board of Directors, and disrupt our business.\nIf our indefinite-lived or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nOur valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on projections of future operating performance. We operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary materially from actual results. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a result of our impairment testing of our goodwill and other long-lived assets during the period in which any impairment of our indefinite-lived assets or other long-lived assets is determined.\nThe recent COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. and other countries are experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19, which is continuing to spread to other countries, including countries in which we, our customers and our suppliers do business. Governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas. We continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made appropriate modifications to our operations because of COVID-19, including substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These decisions may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The cancellation of major industry events in the region reduces our ability to meet with existing and potential new customers. Our customers\u2019 businesses could be disrupted or they could seek to limit spending, either of which could foreclose future business opportunities, could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us and ultimately could adversely affect our revenues. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the payment of accounts receivable and collections. Although we are unable to predict the precise impact of COVID-19 on our business, our mobile communications business in particular depends to a large extent on travel and the willingness of customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. We anticipate that, unless the outbreak is swiftly contained, governmental, individual, business and other organizational measures to limit the spread of the virus will adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. This or any other outbreak and any additional preventative or protective actions that may be taken in response to this or any other global health threat or pandemic may result in additional business and/or operational disruption.\nAdditionally, global economic disruptions like COVID-19 could negatively impact our supply chain and cause delays in the delivery of raw materials, components and other supplies that we need to conduct our operations. We may be unable to locate replacement materials, components or other supplies, and ongoing delays could reduce sales and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and possible treatments, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel and other activity, and public reactions to these factors.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third-Parties\nIf we are not able to obtain necessary licenses, services or distribution rights for third-party technology at acceptable prices, or at all, our products could become obsolete or we may not be able to deliver certain product offerings.\nWe have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our current products and our product lines. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology or obtain services from third-parties to develop new\nproducts or product enhancements or to provide specific solutions. Third-party providers may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The inability to maintain or re-license any third-party products required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses and services necessary to develop new products and product enhancements or provide specific solutions could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost. Such inabilities could delay or prevent us from making these products or services, which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our solutions.\nA portion of the technology licensed by us incorporates \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, if we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or alterations under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contain the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services. We could also be required to seek licenses from third-parties to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities or our enterprise cloud computing providers could impair the delivery of our service, adversely affect our financial results and otherwise harm our business.\nWe use third-party data center hosting facilities for customers buying our SaaS product offering, and we use enterprise cloud computing providers in connection with certain other aspects of our business, including cloud-based data processing, storage and other services. In the case of data center hosting facilities, while we control the actual computer and storage systems upon which our software runs, and deploy them to the data center hosting facilities, we do not control the operation or availability of these facilities. We similarly do not have control over the operation or availability of enterprise cloud computing providers that we use. Any changes in third-party service levels at these facilities or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to these facilities that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.\nOur products are often integrated with other third-party products. Third-party delays could adversely affect our future financial operating results.\nWe sell our products in accordance with our standard product specifications. There can be instances where our products are integrated into a larger solution with other third-party products, the delivery of which is controlled by third party providers. We have little, if any, control over the timing of delivery of third-party products, and a delay from the time of our product delivery to the production launch of the larger solution can materially impact our financial operating results.\nOur ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our third-party vendors.\nWe rely on other companies to provide products and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our third-party vendors experience delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, if one or more of the products which we depend on becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these third-party vendors, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier\u2019s control or because of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.\nBecause we purchase certain components used in assembling some of our products from sole suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a failure of these suppliers to provide these components.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-parties who provide certain components used in our products. We may experience quality control problems, where products did not meet specifications or were damaged in shipping, and delays in the receipt of these components. These risks could be heightened during a substantial economic slowdown or if a sole supplier were adversely affected by a natural disaster because our suppliers are more likely to experience adverse changes in their financial condition and operations during such a period. While we believe that there are alternative suppliers available for these components, we believe that the procurement of these components from alternative suppliers could take a significant amount of time. In addition, these alternative components may not be functionally equivalent or may not be available on a timely basis or on similar terms. The inability to obtain sufficient key components as required, or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While to date there has been suitable component capacity readily available at acceptable quality levels, in the future there may not be suppliers that can meet our future volume or quality requirements at a price that is favorable to us. Any financial, operational, production or quality assurance difficulties experienced by these suppliers that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.\nOur revenue is difficult to forecast, and as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a \u201cpipeline\u201d system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the \u201cconversion rate\u201d or \u201cclosure rate\u201d of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in capital spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amounts or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner.\nIn addition to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, the following risks could cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022\nthe rates at which our customers renew;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue generated from our customers\u2019 use of our products or services in excess of their committed contractual entitlements;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of costs of new and existing sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of the development and introduction of new product and service offerings by us or our competitors.\nBecause a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions.\nA disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations and impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur data processing and financial reporting systems are cloud-based and hosted by a third-party. An interruption to the third-party systems or in the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the third-party systems for an extended period may impact our ability to operate the business and process transactions which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. It may also result in our inability to comply with SEC regulations in a timely manner. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced a ransomware attack on our information technology system. While such attack did not have a material adverse effect on our business operation, it caused a temporary disruption.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a relatively new and rapidly developing market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nThe market for our products and services is relatively new and rapidly developing, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including those related to:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our current and future products and services;\n\u2022\ncustomer renewal rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the market for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully expand our business, especially internationally;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenses, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches and any associated expenses;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully manage acquisitions; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nIf we do not manage these risks successfully, our business will be harmed.\nIf we fail to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies and services in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries, our business could decline.\nThe markets for our products, services and technologies is characterized by rapid change and technological evolution. We will need to continue to expend considerable resources on research and development in the future in order to continue to design and deliver enduring, innovative entertainment products, services and technologies. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to consistently develop and effectively market new products, technologies and services that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace. In addition, we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities. Our future success depends to a great extent on our ability to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries and that are compatible with the technologies, services or products introduced by other entertainment industry participants.\nDespite our efforts and investments in developing new products, services and technologies:\n\u2022\nwe may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all;\n\u2022\nwe cannot assure you that the level of funding and significant resources we are committing for investments in new products, services and technologies will be sufficient or result in successful new products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nwe cannot assure you that our newly developed products, services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022\nwe cannot assure you that any new products or services that we develop will achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\nour products, services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nwe cannot assure you that revenue from new products, services or technologies will offset any decline in revenue from our products, services and technologies which may become obsolete; and\n\u2022\nour competitors and/or potential customers may develop products, services or technologies similar to those developed by us, resulting in a reduction in the potential demand for our newly developed products, services or technologies.\nOur failure to successfully develop new and improved products, services and technologies, including as a result of any of the risks described above, may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\nOur future success is dependent on the manner in which the multiscreen video and OTT markets develop, and if these markets develop in a manner that does not facilitate inclusion of our products and services, our business may not continue to grow.\nA large portion of our anticipated revenue growth is expected to come from sales and services related to our multiscreen video and OTT products. These markets continue to develop as commercial markets, both within and outside North America. In addition to the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development being uncertain, so too is the technological manner in which they will develop. The success of these markets will require that video service providers continue to upgrade their cable networks to service and successfully market multiscreen video, OTT and similar services to their cable television subscribers in a manner that permits inclusion of our products and services. If cable system operators and telecommunications companies fail to make the capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their networks or determine that broad deployment of multiscreen video and OTT services is not viable as a business proposition or if our products cannot support a substantial number of subscribers while maintaining a high level of performance, our revenue will not grow as we have planned.\nIf content providers limit the scope of content licensed for use in the digital VOD and OTT market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected because the potential market for our products would be more limited than we currently believe and have communicated to the financial markets.\nThe success of the multiscreen video market is contingent on content providers permitting their content to be licensed for use in this market. Content providers may, due to concerns regarding either or both marketing and illegal duplication of the content, limit the extent to which they provide content to their subscribers. A limitation of\ncontent for the VOD and OTT market would indirectly limit the market for our products that are used in connection with that market.\nConsolidations in the markets we serve could result in delays or reductions in purchases of products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets we serve have historically experienced, and continue to experience, the consolidation of many industry participants. For example, AT&T acquired Direct TV, Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable, Altice NV acquired HOT, Suddenlink Communications and Cablevision Systems Corp., and Frontier Communications Corporation bought select assets from Verizon Communications Inc. When consolidations occur, it is possible that the acquirer will not continue using the same suppliers, possibly resulting in an immediate or future elimination of sales opportunities for us or our competitors. Even if sales are not reduced, consolidation can also result in pressure from customers for lower prices or better terms, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Consolidations also could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the affected companies prior to completion of the transaction and by the merged businesses. The purchasing decisions of the merged companies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere is no assurance that the current cost of Internet connectivity and network access will not rise with the increasing popularity of online media services.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for our principal connections to the Internet and network access, and to deliver media to consumers. As demand for online media increases, there can be no assurance that Internet and network service providers will continue to price their network access services on reasonable terms. The distribution of online media requires delivery of digital content files and providers of network access and distribution may change their business models and increase their prices significantly, which could slow the widespread adoption of such services. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a reasonable price model in place to allow for the continuous distribution of digital media files. We have limited or no control over the extent to which any of these circumstances may occur, and if network access or distribution prices rise, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.\nWe have been and, in the future, could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which on occasion, have resulted in significant and often protracted litigation. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications from third-parties asserting infringements on patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products or processes. We may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others\u2019 intellectual property. Any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement, as many of our commercial agreements require us to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third-party with respect to our products. We have received certain claims for indemnification from customers but have not been made party to any litigation involving intellectual property infringement claims as a result. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. This possibility of multiple damages serves to increase the incentive for plaintiffs to bring such litigation. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention away from our operations. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. In addition, any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using the products that use the infringed intellectual property or obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, although this license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or redesign those products that use the infringed intellectual property. If we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, our business may be seriously harmed.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nThe success of our business model could be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment, such as changes that either would limit capital expenditures by television, cable or telecommunications operators or reverse the trend towards deregulation in the industries in which we compete.\nThe telecommunications and media industries are subject to extensive regulation which may limit the growth of our business, both in the U.S. and other countries. The growth of our business internationally is dependent in part on deregulation of the telecommunications industry abroad, like that which has occurred in the U.S., and the timing and magnitude of this growth, which is uncertain. Video service providers are subject to extensive government regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and other federal, state and international regulatory agencies. These regulations could have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by video service providers and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The enactment by federal, state or international governments of new laws or regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing regulations or a reversal of the trend toward deregulation in these industries could adversely affect our customers, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access to or commerce on the Internet. With more business being conducted over the Internet, there have been calls for more stringent copyright protection, tax, consumer protection, cybersecurity, data localization and content restriction laws, both in the U.S. and abroad. We could be materially, adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as net neutrality. Further, governments may regulate or restrict the sales, licensing, distribution, and export or import of certain technologies to certain countries. The adoption of regulation of Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products and services, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the enactment of new federal, state, or foreign data privacy laws and regulations could cause customers not to be able to take advantage of all the features or capabilities of our products and services, which in turn could reduce demand for certain of our products and services.\nEvolving data privacy regulations, including the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), may subject us to significant penalties.\nIn May 2018, the EU\u2019s GDPR came into effect, and changed how businesses can collect, use and process the personal data of EU residents. The GDPR has extraterritorial effect and imposes a mandatory duty on businesses to self-report personal data breaches to authorities, and, under certain circumstances, to affected individuals. The GDPR also grants individuals the right to erasure (commonly referred to as the right to be forgotten), which may put a burden on us to erase records upon request. Compliance with the GDPR\u2019s new requirements may increase our legal, compliance, and operational costs. Non-compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements can result in significant penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, expose us to legal and regulatory costs, and impair our reputation.\nOther jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business, have also enacted or are considering enacting their own versions of \u201cGDPR-like\u201d data privacy legislation, which could create additional compliance challenges, heightened regulatory scrutiny, administrative burden and potentially expose us to significant penalties. For example, in June 2018, California\u2019s legislature passed the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our business partners, or third party service providers to comply with GDPR, CCPA, other privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments in contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation.\nIn addition, some countries have or are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, could increase the cost and complexity of offering our products, software and services or maintaining our business operations in those jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and our failure to comply could result in penalties that could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials to obtain or keep business. The FCPA also requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the Company. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA and similar laws in other countries can impose civil and criminal penalties for violations.\nIf we do not properly implement practices and controls with respect to compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, or if we fail to enforce those practices and controls properly, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on our business activities, all of which could harm our reputation, business and financial condition.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, we are subject to sales, use and similar taxes in many countries, jurisdictions and provinces, including those states in the U.S. where we maintain a physical presence or have a substantial nexus. These taxing regimes are complex. For example, in the U.S., each state and local taxing authority has its own interpretation of what constitutes a sufficient physical presence or nexus to require the collection and remittance of these taxes. Similarly, each state and local taxing authority has its own rules regarding the applicability of sales tax by customer or product type.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nWe may not fully realize the benefits of our completed acquisitions or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits. Future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in new businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, augment our market coverage, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in February 2019, we acquired Xstream A/S, an OTT media cloud platform provider based in Copenhagen, Denmark and Warsaw, Poland for approximately $4.6 million in cash and 541,738 shares of our common stock. Acquisitions could create risks for us, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel, operations, technologies or products that may affect our ability to develop new products and services and compete in our rapidly changing marketplace due to a resulting decrease in the quality of work and innovation of our employees upon which our business is dependent;\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing, or failure to realize, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Even if we can integrate these businesses and operations successfully, we may not realize the full benefits we expect to achieve, within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. If a company we purchase does not perform as we expected, our investment could become impaired or we could discontinue the operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on the business relationships with pre-existing suppliers and customers of both companies. This may be important to our business because we sell our products to a limited number of large customers, we purchase certain components used in manufacturing our products from sole suppliers and we use a limited number of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty among current and prospective employees regarding their future roles with our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel.\nAcquisitions or divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe could acquire additional products, technologies or businesses, or enter joint venture arrangements, to complement or expand our business, or engage in divestitures. As previously noted, we acquired Xstream A/S in February 2019. Negotiation of potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures and our integration or transfer of acquired or divested products, technologies or businesses, could divert management\u2019s time and resources.\nAs part of our strategy for growth, we may continue to explore acquisitions, divestitures, or strategic collaborations, which may not be completed or may not be ultimately beneficial to us.\nAcquisitions or divestitures may pose risks to our operations, including:\n\u2022\nproblems and increased costs in connection with the integration or divestiture of the personnel, operations, technologies, or products of the acquired or divested businesses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business during the acquisition or divestiture process;\n\u2022\ninability to make planned divestitures of businesses on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nacquired assets becoming impaired because of technical advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions or investments we could:\n\u2022\nissue stock that would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages, such as occurred in connection with our February 2019 acquisition of Xstream A/S;\n\u2022\nincur debt and assume liabilities;\n\u2022\nrecord contingent liabilities estimated for potential earnouts based on achieving financial targets;\n\u2022\nobtain financing on unfavorable terms;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs;\n\u2022\nincur large expenditures related to office closures of the acquired companies, including costs relating to the termination of employees and facility and leasehold improvement charges resulting from our having to vacate the acquired companies\u2019 premises; and\n\u2022\nreduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or for other purposes.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product, which could harm our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.\nWe may, from time-to-time, outsource engineering work related to the design and development of our products, typically to save money and gain access to additional engineering resources. We have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Poland and the Netherlands. We have limited experience in the outsourcing of engineering and other work to third-parties located\ninternationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the U.S. If we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of this engineering and other work related to our products, we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property, or the loss of the ability to claim such intellectual property, including patents and trade names. Additionally, instead of saving money, we could in fact incur significant additional costs because of inefficient engineering services and poor work product. As a result, our business would be harmed, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.\nBecause our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations, we may not be able to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services.\nApproximately 69% of our total revenue was generated from sales outside the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) during the most recent fiscal year. Our international operations are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our business in the foreseeable future. However, in the future we may be unable to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ninability to collect accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in selling, servicing and supporting overseas products and services and in translating products and services into foreign languages;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nmultiple and possibly overlapping tax structures;\n\u2022\nnegative tax consequences such as withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes;\n\u2022\ndifferences in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees and engage in restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nbusiness and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social and economic instability and unrest, including risks related to terrorist activity;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic policies by foreign governments, including the imposition and potential continued expansion of economic sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) or the Russian Federation;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;\n\u2022\ncultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters and pandemics; and\n\u2022\ngrowth and stability of the economy or political changes in international markets.\nThe impact of one or more of these international risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we often sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase local currency operating costs. In preparing our consolidated\nfinancial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations; nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, and our Board of Directors recently adopted Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an ownership trigger threshold of 4.9%, any of which could render more difficult, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. Nor does the rights agreement prevent our Board of Directors from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile and an investment in our stock may decline. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our securities could be delisted.\nHistorically, the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile. Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial price volatility. The occurrence of any one or more of the factors noted in these risk factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline below the $1.00 Nasdaq minimum price requirement such that we become subject to delisting proceedings. Any delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, having been delisted or being subject to delisting proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private markets. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.\nWe use estimates in accounting for our contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nContract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenue and costs and making assumptions including, in the case of our professional services contracts, the total amount of labor required to complete a project and the complexity of the development and other technical work to be completed. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions must be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include estimated third-party vendor and contract labor costs. Penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Third-party vendors\u2019 assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and margin.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party challenges.\nOur success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology that is incorporated into our products. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Although we have issued patents, we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued or that the issued patents will not be invalidated. We also enter confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products or technology without authorization, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. We may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\nWe face the risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it or that it would result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nTo the extent that our existing cash and investments are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist and we were to seek additional funding, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our stockholders may incur substantial dilution from any financing that we undertake given our current stock price.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had federal NOLs of $131.1 million. Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Generally, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during an applicable testing period (typically, three years). Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d such corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. While no \u201cownership change\u201d has resulted in annual limitations, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change.\u201d In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the consideration could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs in the future, utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. Any limitation on our ability to use NOLs may adversely impact our financial results. In March 2019, we adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an ownership trigger threshold of 4.9% to assist in the preservation of our ability to use NOLs and tax credit carryforwards, which was approved by our stockholders at our last annual meeting of stockholders.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data on our systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nCyber criminals and hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security, misappropriate our proprietary information or cause business interruptions. Our service involves the transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information or a network disruption, which may result in litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results. Additionally, third-parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing\nsensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.\nIn addition, in the past few years, widespread ransomware attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere have affected many companies, the government and commercial computer systems, and we also experienced a ransomware attack on our information technology system during the fiscal year[, which temporarily denied customers access to our services]. While such attack did not have a material adverse effect on our business operation, it caused temporary disruptions and interfered with our operations. While we intend to implement additional measures to enhance our security protocol to protect our system, there is no guarantee that future attacks or other breakdowns or breaches in our system can be thwarted or prevented, and failure to do so may increase our cost of operations and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. Any costs that we incur as a result of the ransomware attack or any future data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any future ransomware attacks, breaches or failures in our operational security systems can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to confidential information and could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business operations and lead to legal liability from customers, third parties and governmental authorities, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations materially.\nWe may experience risks in our investments due to changes in the market, which could adversely affect the value or liquidity of our investments.\nWe maintain a portfolio of marketable securities in a variety of instruments, which may include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, government debt securities and corporate bonds. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. As a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 84255, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SEAC"}
