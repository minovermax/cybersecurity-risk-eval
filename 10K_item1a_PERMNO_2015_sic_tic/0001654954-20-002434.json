{"cik": "875355", "company": "INSIGNIA SYSTEMS INC/MN", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to many risks. The following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance.\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe face significant competition from News America, the primary provider of at-shelf advertising and promotional signage for a significant majority of retailers. Despite our status as exclusive agent for selling signs with price into the News America network, we continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater market presence and financial resources that can be used to market their products and purchase exclusive access to retailers and CPG manufacturers. Should our competition succeed in obtaining more of the at-shelf advertising business from our current CPG manufacturers, develop or extend exclusive relationships with our current retailers, our revenues and related operations would be adversely affected.\nWe also compete against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, and providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store solutions, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, store coverage and other factors. The increasing popularity of digital media among consumers is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional in-store tactics to digital. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for in-store advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure, which would have an adverse effect on sales and our financial results.\nOur Results Are Dependent on Our CPG Manufacturing Partners\u2019 Continued Use of Our POPS Solution\nOur financial results have been historically dependent on the success of our Insignia POPS point-of-purchase in-store signage solution, which is purchased primarily by CPG manufacturers. Our POPS solution represented approximately 54% of our total net sales in 2019. We also continue to have a concentrated CPG customer base for our POPS solution. Our top two CPG customers together accounted for approximately 25% of our total net sales in 2019.\nDuring late 2018, we saw changes in the CPG manufacturers who participate in our solutions that have adversely impacted POPS sales, through CPG manufacturers both forgoing new contracts and reducing forward participation. We also have seen increased competitive activities that are expected to lead to further decreases in POPS sales. In addition, volatility in CPG manufacturer spend has resulted from shrinking advertising budgets, expanded product solutions, and increased competition.\nShould changes in economic conditions result in reductions in advertising and promotional expenditures by CPG manufacturers that lead to a slower rate of growth or a decrease in spending for the in-store advertising services we offer or we are unable to acquire business from new CPG manufacturers or should any one of the manufacturers who account for a significant amount of our POPS revenues terminate or reduce its participation in the POPS solution or a significant change in our retailer network our business and results of operations would be adversely affected due to our heavy dependence on this solution.\nThe Viability of Our In-Store Signage Solutions and Our Results Are Dependent on Our Ongoing Business Relationships with Retailers\nTo execute our POPS solution, we have entered into arrangements with retailers that provide us with access to place signs on shelves in their stores for our CPG manufacturing customers. We have also accessed a portion of our retailer relationships through third parties. During 2019, our top three retailer relationships provided distribution for 17% of our total net sales.\nAs previously announced, a significant retailer exited our retailer network in the first half of 2019. The impacts of the loss of this retailer is reflected in our results for 2019. Our ability to sell our in-store solutions is substantially dependent on the quantity and quality of the retailer locations in our network. If we are unable secure new retailers that resonate with our CPGs, it would have a continuing adverse effect on sales of our in-store signage solutions and our financial results.\nOur retailer contracts generally have terms of one to three years and we are negotiating the renewal of these contracts on an ongoing basis. The future renewal of these contracts on profitable terms is not free from doubt. For instance, some of our retailer contracts require us to guarantee minimum payments and we may be unable to profitably offer a guarantee at the level required by a retailer during renewal negotiations. Further decreases in the size or quality of our retail distribution network, including the loss of another significant retailer, would have an adverse effect on sales of our in-store signage solutions and our financial results.\nOur In-Store Signage Solutions Are Dependent on The Success of Our Business Relationship with News America\nOur results depend, in part, on the success of our sales and marketing efforts as News America\u2019s exclusive agent for signs with price into the News America network of retailers and upon our ability to successfully sell solutions into this network. Notwithstanding the terms of our agreement with News America, our ability to sell and execute signs with price under that arrangement is substantially dependent on News America\u2019s cooperation and we have not gained any additional access to News America\u2019s retail network during 2019. Further, the agreement that provides for our exclusive agency for signs with price is scheduled to expire in February 2021. Disputes with News America regarding the operational aspects of that agreement or the termination or expiration of contracts relating to signs with price are likely to have an adverse effect on our results. For example, we are currently party to legal proceedings involving News America, which are described further in Item 3 of Part I of this report.\nOur Growth Is Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Develop and Introduce New Solution Offerings that Meet Client Demands\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful new products and the ability to secure and maintain access to retailer locations that are appealing to CPG manufacturers. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful or have the necessary scale to be profitable.\nWe Have Been, and Are, Party to Significant Litigation\nWe monitor the competitive practices of those in our industry for fairness which may lead to disputes that could have adverse effects on our Company or its business. We were involved in significant litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. In 2011, we and News America entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years.\nIn July 2019, we brought suit against News America in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, alleging violations of federal and state antitrust and tortious interference laws by News America. The complaint alleges that News America has monopolized the relevant market through various wrongful acts designed to harm the Company, its last significant competitor, in the third-party in-store advertising and promotion products and services market. The suit seeks, among other relief, an injunction sufficient to prevent further antitrust injury and an award of treble damages to be determined at trial for the harm caused to our Company. For further description of our legal proceedings, see Item 3 in Part I of this report.\nWe cannot be assured that we will succeed in asserting our claims or, if we are successful, that our recovery (if any) will be adequate to cover the damages incurred. It is also possible that we may be unsuccessful in defending against any counterclaims, that a judgement will not be entered against us or that reserves (if any) we may set aside will be adequate to cover any such judgments. In addition, we may incur significant expenses during the litigation while recovery is uncertain or pending.\nOur Customers May Be Affected by Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by CPG manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending and our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions inclusive of the dynamic global trade environment. Another economic downturn may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Retailers may be impacted by changes in consumer spending as well, which may adversely impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing retailers as well as contract with new retailers on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Key Employees Is Critical to Our Success\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Results of Operations Have Been and May Be Subject to Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u25cf the addition or loss of contracts with retailers;\n\u25cf the addition or loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u25cf the timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u25cf the timing of new retail stores being added or removed;\n\u25cf costs of evaluating and developing new products, and customers accepting new products;\n\u25cf the timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u25cf competitive conditions in our industry.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2019, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a low of $0.67 to a high of $1.68. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.\nNasdaq may Delist Our Common Stock, which Could Limit Your Ability to Make Transactions in Our Securities and Subject Our Common Stock to Additional Restrictions\nOn December 31, 2019, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) stating that the closing bid price of our company\u2019s common stock was below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required by Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) for at least 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), our Company has a compliance period of 180 days, or until June 29, 2020, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In order to regain compliance, our common stock must maintain a consolidated bid price of $1.00 or greater for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the compliance period.\nIf compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement cannot be demonstrated by June 29, 2020, then our Company may be eligible for a second 180-day period to regain compliance. To be eligible, our Company will be required to meet continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market (except the Minimum Bid Price Requirement) and we will need to provide Nasdaq with written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, which may take the form of a reverse stock split. If we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement prior to June 29, 2020 and are not eligible for the second compliance period, or if it appears to the Nasdaq staff that our Company will not be able to regain compliance, then our common stock will be subject to delisting. At such time, we may have an opportunity to appeal Nasdaq\u2019s delisting determination.\nThe notice from Nasdaq has no immediate effect on the trading of our common stock and our common stock is expected to remain listed on Nasdaq during the compliance period(s).\nIf the bid price of our common stock fails to regain compliance it may be subject to delisting. Our common stock would likely then trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news for our Company.\nWe May be Impacted if Our Information Systems Are Attacked\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Insignia and its employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats-from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data-are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and products and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain. Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs. Should such an attack succeed, it could expose us and our employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
