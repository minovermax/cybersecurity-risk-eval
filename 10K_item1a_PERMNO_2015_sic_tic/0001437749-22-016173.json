{"cik": "69891", "company": "NATIONAL BEVERAGE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-06-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business and financial results.\nBrand image and consumer preferences. Our beverage portfolio is comprised of a number of unique brands with reputations and consumer loyalty that have been built over time. Our investments in social media and marketing as well as our strong commitment to product quality are intended to have a favorable impact on brand image and consumer preferences. Unfavorable publicity, or allegations of quality issues, even if false or unfounded, may tarnish our reputation and brand image and cause consumers to choose other products. In addition, if we do not adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, health concerns and product preferences, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nCompetition. The beverage industry is extremely competitive. Our products compete with a broad range of beverage products, most of which are manufactured and distributed by companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources. Discounting and other actions by our competitors could adversely affect our ability to sustain revenues and profits.\nCustomer relationships. Our retail customer base has been consolidating over many years resulting in fewer customers with increased purchasing power. This increased purchasing power can limit our ability to increase pricing for our products with certain of our customers. Additionally, e-commerce transactions and value stores are experiencing rapid growth. Our inability to adapt to customer requirements could lead to a loss of business and adversely affect our financial results.\nRaw materials and energy. The production of our products is dependent on certain raw materials, including aluminum, resin, corn, linerboard, water and fruit juice. In addition, the production and distribution of our products is dependent on energy sources, including natural gas, fuel and electricity. These items are subject to supply chain disruptions and price volatility caused by numerous factors. Commodity price increases ultimately result in a corresponding increase in the cost of raw materials and energy. We may be limited in our ability to pass these increases on to our customers or may incur a loss in sales volume to the extent price increases are taken. In addition, strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls, tariffs, national emergencies, natural disasters, supply shortages or other events could affect our continued supply and cost of raw materials and energy. If raw materials or energy costs increase, or their availability is limited, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nGovernmental regulation. Our business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. In addition, various governmental agencies have enacted or are considering changes in corporate tax laws as well as, additional taxes on soft drinks and other sweetened beverages. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results.\nSustained increases in the cost of employee wages and benefits. Our profitability is affected by the cost of employee wages as well as medical and other benefits provided to employees, including employees covered under collective bargaining agreements and multi-employer pension plans. Competition in the labor marketplace for qualified employees has led to increased costs, such as higher wages and benefit costs in order to recruit and retain employees. A prolonged labor shortage or inflation in labor costs could adversely impact our financial results.\nUnfavorable weather conditions. Unfavorable weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Unusually cold or rainy weather may temporarily reduce demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect our profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which we do business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect our ability to produce and distribute products.\nDependence on key personnel. Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them. Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them. If we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our operations and ability to manage our business may be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The magnitude and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain and may impact our operations by events beyond our control. Such events could include disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing materials, supplies and services, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability. Such events could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nDependence on information technology and third-party service providers. We use information technology and third-party service providers to support our business processes and activities. Continuity of business applications and services may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware or other cybersecurity breaches or attacks; issues with systems\u2019 maintenance or security; power outages; hardware or software failures; telecommunication failures; natural disasters; and other catastrophic occurrences. If our controls, disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner, our sales, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76839, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "FIZZ"}
