{"cik": "1093082", "company": "HUTTIG BUILDING PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.\nWe cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth initiatives.\nIn connection with our growth initiatives, including the strategic initiatives described in Part I, Item 1 under the heading \u201cStrategic Initiatives,\u201d we have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value for our stockholders.\nOur ability to successfully execute on our growth initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Further, the anticipated benefits from these efforts are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute on portions of our growth strategy or as a result of the impact of the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn execution of our growth initiatives, we may experience higher-than-expected expenses without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, this strategy may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term or longer. Our growth initiatives also require a significant investment in working capital which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. There can be no assurance regarding the timing of or the extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments in our Company and other costs, if at all.\nOur growth initiatives require significant financial and other resources along with significant management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from our core business and other business issues and opportunities. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital to support our growth initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur growth initiatives require a significant investment in inventories, including new or expanded product lines which, if excessive, could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nMany of the products included in our growth initiatives are sourced internationally and represent newer or expanded product lines for the majority of our distribution centers. These initiatives are also designed to drive sales, including to new customers not historically serviced by us. If sales expectations are not met, or if the products we purchase do not readily sell, we may have excess or obsolete inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nAlthough the homebuilding industry has improved over recent years, any downturn from current construction levels could materially affect our business, liquidity and operating results.\nOur sales and results of operations depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement, repair and remodeling markets. The strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential remodeling projects, which are a function of many factors beyond our control. Some of these factors include general economic and political conditions, employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, housing inventory, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, trade restrictions, sanctions and disputes, prices of commodity wood and steel products, government shutdowns, immigration patterns, regional demographics and consumer confidence.\nNew housing activity in the United States has shown modest improvement since 2009. However, 2019 activity of 1.3 million was still below the Historical Average of approximately 1.4 million starts. Based on the current level of housing activity and industry forecasts, we expect new housing activity to continue its moderate increase, but we cannot be certain. There can be no assurance that the U.S. housing market will grow and develop in a manner consistent with our expectations. A prolonged downturn in current construction levels or any significant downturn in the major markets we serve or in the economy in general could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition, including but not limited to our ability to comply with the financial covenant under our credit facility and could cause an impairment due to the implied valuation of our goodwill. Reduced levels of construction activity may result in continued intense price competition among building materials suppliers, which may adversely affect our gross margins. Further, we extend credit to numerous customers\nwho are generally susceptible to the same economic business risks as we are. Adverse homebuilding market conditions could result in financial failures of one, or more, of our significant customers and we may not necessarily be aware of any deteriorations in our customers\u2019 position.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly cyclical, and any cyclical market factors resulting in lower demand or increased supply could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures caused by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic and political conditions, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, levels of new construction, home improvement and remodeling activity, interest rates and population growth. The supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity, and excess capacity in the industry can result in significant declines in market prices for those products. To the extent that cyclical market factors adversely impact overall demand for building products or the prices that we can charge for our products, our net sales and margins would likely decline in the same time frame as the cyclical downturn occurs. Because much of our overhead and expense is relatively fixed in nature, a decrease in sales and margin generally has a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. To the extent our customers experience downturns in their business, our ability to collect our receivables could be adversely affected. Finally, the unpredictable nature of the cyclical market factors that impact our industry make it difficult to forecast our operating results.\nIf we are unable to meet the financial covenant under our credit facility, the lenders could elect to accelerate repayment of the outstanding balance and, in that event, we would be forced to seek alternative sources of financing.\nWe fund our working capital by borrowing funds under a $250.0 million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility, which contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (\u201cFCCR\u201d) that is tested if our excess borrowing availability, as defined in the facility, reaches an amount in the range of less than $17.5 million to $31.3 million depending on our borrowing base at the time of testing. For 2019, the minimum FCCR was not required to be tested as excess borrowing availability was greater than the minimum threshold but, if we had been unable to maintain excess borrowing availability of more than the applicable amount in the range of $17.5 million to $31.3 million as required, we would not have met the minimum required FCCR at December 31, 2019. If in the future, we fail to meet the required FCCR and are unable to maintain excess borrowing availability of more than the applicable required amount, our lenders would have the right to terminate the loan commitments and accelerate the repayment of the entire amount outstanding under the credit facility. Our lenders also could foreclose on our assets that secure our credit facility. In that event, we would be forced to seek alternative sources of financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCompliance with the restrictions and financial covenant under our credit agreement and changes in LIBOR may limit our borrowing availability and may limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including accounts receivable, inventory, real estate and equipment. We are also subject to certain operating limitations commonly applicable to a loan of this type, which, among other things, place limitations on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, cash dividends, stock repurchases and transactions with affiliates. A minimum FCCR must be tested on a pro forma basis prior to consummation of certain significant business transactions outside our ordinary course of business. These restrictions may limit management\u2019s ability to operate our business in accordance with management\u2019s discretion, which could limit our ability to pursue certain strategic objectives.\nBorrowings under our credit agreement and other variable rate indebtedness may use the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to cease to be used entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on\nour financial position, liquidity and results of operations. See Part II, Item 7A - \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for additional information.\nIn addition, the growth in our business may cause us to seek additional financing or increase the size of the credit facility. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, our ability to grow may be limited which could negatively impact our overall operations.\nWe use international sources for the production of certain of our products, which exposes us to certain additional risks.\nWe use international vendors for the supply of certain products. Global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors, uncertainties, and risks, some of which are beyond our control, including increased shipping costs, increased import duties, more restrictive quotas, loss of most favored nation trading status, currency fluctuation, work stoppages, transportation delays, port of entry issues, economic uncertainties such as inflation, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, trade restrictions, sanctions and disputes, political instability, the financial stability of vendors, merchandise quality issues, and tariffs and other import taxes. Additionally, products acquired from international sources are generally paid for before leaving the international port, and require longer lead times due to production scheduling and transit requirements, which can negatively impact our liquidity. Operating in the international marketplace requires us to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Negative press or reports about internationally manufactured products, which have become increasingly prominent, may sway public opinion, and thus customer confidence, away from the products sold by us. These and other issues affecting our international operations and vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government frequently imposes new tariffs which have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Additionally, international sourcing of certain of our products may subject us to anti-dumping or countervailing duties imposed by the U.S. government in response to other countries dumping steel or aluminum products in the United States below fair market value. Anti-dumping or countervailing duties may increase the cost of our internationally sourced products imported into the United States, and in the case of retrospective application, we may become subject to additional costs for previously sourced products and unable to recoup the increased cost from international companies, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The tariffs, along with any new or additional tariffs, trade restrictions or duties that are unpredictable but may be implemented by the United States or other countries, could result in increased prices and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe impact of the coronavirus outbreak, or similar global health concerns, could negatively impact our ability to source certain products, impact product pricing, or have a negative impact on our business.\nOur use of international suppliers for production and shipping of certain products could be negatively impacted by the regional or global outbreak of illnesses, including the novel coronavirus. Any quarantines, labor shortages or other disruptions to our suppliers and their contract manufacturers or our customers would likely adversely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the supply or demand for our products. Order lead times could be extended or delayed and pricing could increase. Some products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing. To date, the outbreak of coronavirus has not significantly impacted our operations, although we believe certain of our suppliers may have been negatively impacted. Accordingly, we are considering alternative product sourcing in the event that product supply becomes problematic. We are unable to predict the possible future effect on our Company if coronavirus or another such virus continues to expand globally.\nProduct liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs is the case with other companies in our industry, we face the risk of product liability and other claims of the type that are typical to our industry if use of products that we have distributed causes other damages. Product liability\nclaims in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not covered under our insurance policies or indemnified by our suppliers, which could be more difficult to enforce against our international suppliers, could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFluctuation in prices of commodity wood and steel products that we buy and resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in wood and steel commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past, and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future. Such changes can adversely affect the gross margins we realize on the resale of the products. We may be unable to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any negative impact of these changes on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These prices may change as a result of, among other things, the risks described below with respect to our international sources of our products.\nThe market price and liquidity of our securities are subject to volatility.\nThe market price and liquidity of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading volume, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our business and the general state of the securities market, as well as general economic, political and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. In 2019, the price of our common stock varied significantly. Stockholders may have incurred substantial losses with regard to any investment in our common stock, adversely affecting stockholder confidence.\nStockholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nIn recent years, stockholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Stockholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic initiatives and operations of public companies. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert management and employee attention, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our growth initiatives, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. Actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock prices based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nCurrent or future litigation and regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on us.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. No assurance can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits, investigations or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending ourselves in these matters may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives and growth strategy.\nAdditionally, in the event of litigation, we may sustain significant damages or settlement expenses (regardless of merit), litigation expenses and significant harm to our reputation. Any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement may not be covered by insurance. Filing claims under these policies may result in our inability to maintain adequate liability insurance at acceptable costs or on favorable terms. Under our charter and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers and third parties, we are required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their participation in certain proceedings. There can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nWe depend on information technology, including our own information technology system and third party telecommunications facilities, as an essential element to sustain our operations. Our system enables us to interface with our local distribution centers and customers, as well as to maintain and timely update financial and business records. Additionally, in 2019, we implemented an upgraded financial reporting and data analysis system to support the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives and improve efficiency of planning and analysis. Implementing reporting and data tools involves changes to business processes and extensive organizational training. The changes, which caused some temporary disruption to our business in 2019, may cause the Company to experience additional temporary business and information technology disruptions that could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure of the information technology systems used by us or those of third parties with whom we interact could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers or impediments to the shipment of products, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, a cybersecurity breach, as a result of attack, human error or otherwise, could result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property, proprietary information and personal information of our customers and employees. We cannot provide absolute assurance that our controls and procedures are sufficient to ensure that relevant information pertaining to cybersecurity risks and incidents is identified, collected, processed and timely reported to the appropriate parties to allow management to properly assess and analyze potential impacts and disclosure obligations. Further, despite our best efforts, employees may not be fully aware or understand our cybersecurity internal controls and may fail to recognize potentially relevant events.\nAn information technology failure, including as a result of human error or the failure of internal controls with respect to cybersecurity, could expose us to financial losses from necessary remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, as well as reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nThe termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe distribute building products that we purchase from a number of major suppliers. As is customary in our industry, most of our relationships with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice. More than half of our purchases are concentrated with ten suppliers. Although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that in most cases we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers, the termination of key supplier relationships or any other disruption in our sources of supply, particularly of our most commonly sold items, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties could occur from time to time and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and sales personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. If the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key personnel. If we are unable to continue to provide attractive equity compensation awards or other compensation incentives for any reason, we may be unable to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the tight labor market and low unemployment levels may impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel at our distribution centers.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material non-cash write-down.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment tests at least annually, and between annual tests in certain circumstances. We have incurred non-cash impairment charges in prior years. At December 31, 2019, we reported goodwill of $9.5 million. We may be required to incur additional non-cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA significant portion of our sales are on credit to our customers. Material changes in their creditworthiness or our inability to forecast deterioration in their credit position could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe majority of our sales are on account where we provide credit to our customers. In 2019, bad debt expense to total net sales was less than 0.2%. Our customers are generally susceptible to the same economic business risks as we are. Furthermore, we may not necessarily be aware of any deterioration in their financial position. If our customers\u2019 financial positions become impaired, it could have a significant adverse impact on our bad debt exposure and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our sales are concentrated with a relatively small number of customers. A loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2019, our top ten customers represented 44% of our sales, with one customer accounting for 15% of our sales. This customer is a buying group for multiple building material dealers. Although we believe that our relationships with our customers are strong, the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, might require us to make significant expenditures or restrict operations. Some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas where environmental contamination may have occurred, and for which we, among others, could be held responsible. As a result, we may incur material environmental liabilities in the future with respect to our current or former distribution center locations. In addition, we may also be held responsible for environmental liabilities associated with products that we distribute or have distributed in the past. For example, we are required to remediate a property formerly owned by us in Montana pursuant to a unilateral administrative order issued by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cDEQ\u201d). Although we believe we have accurately estimated the cost of implementing the remediation work at the site based on the information we have currently, we cannot provide assurance of the total cost of implementing the final remediation work at the site due to the currently unknown variables relating to the actual levels of contaminants and additional sampling and testing to ensure the remediation will achieve the projected outcome required by the DEQ. Our total cost of implementing the final remediation work at the site may exceed the amounts we have accrued for the matter and thereby could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe building materials distribution industry is competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve.\nThe building materials distribution industry is competitive. Our competition varies by product line, customer classification and geographic market. The principal competitive factors in our industry are:\n\u2022\npricing and availability of product;\n\u2022\nservice and delivery capabilities;\n\u2022\nquality of value-added services;\n\u2022\nability to assist with problem-solving;\n\u2022\ncustomer relationships;\n\u2022\ngeographic coverage;\n\u2022\nfinancial stability and credit terms; and\n\u2022\nbreadth of product offerings.\nWe compete with many local, regional and, in some markets and product categories, national building materials distributors and dealers. In addition, some product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to our customers, and the volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Manufacturers of products distributed by us may also enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with our competition. Further, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, may intensify their marketing efforts to larger contractors and homebuilders. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of our employees are unionized, and any work stoppages by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nApproximately 13% of our employees were members of labor unions as of December 31, 2019 and are represented by eight collective bargaining agreements. We may become subject to significant wage increases or additional work rules imposed by future agreements with labor unions representing our employees. Any such cost increases or new work rule implementation could materially increase our operating expenses. In addition, although we have not experienced any strikes or other significant work interruptions in recent years and have maintained generally favorable relations with our employees, no assurance can be given that there will not be any work stoppages or other labor disturbances in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur unionized employees generally participate in certain multi-employer pension plans and funding requirements for these plans, particularly underfunded plans, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe participate in various multi-employer pension plans. Some of these multi-employer plans may be underfunded at any point in time. While the underfunded status may be cured in the normal course of plan management the creation of a significant obligation could have a material adverse effect on our operations or could materially add to the cost of closing or consolidating operating locations.\nWe have retained accident and claims risk under our insurance programs. Significant claims, and/or our ability to accurately estimate the liability for these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe retain a portion of the accident and claims risk under vehicle liability, product liability, workers\u2019 compensation, medical and other insurance programs. We have multiple claims of various sizes and forecast the number of claims in determining the portion of accident risk we are willing to self-insure. We base loss accruals on our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and adjust them periodically as circumstances change. Due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, our estimates may change. Changes in the actual number of large claims or changes in the estimates of these accruals may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in any such period.\nIn addition, our insurance underwriters require collateral, generally in the form of letters of credit, which reduce our borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had $3.2 million in letters of credit outstanding. Changes in the actual number of large claims could increase our collateral requirements and reduce our borrowing availability under our credit facility.\nWe may acquire other businesses, and, if we do, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, which may impair our financial performance.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities, we may acquire businesses that we believe provide strategic opportunities. If we acquire a business, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may demand significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and operation of our business. If we make future acquisitions, we may issue shares of stock that dilute the ownership interests of other stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses. Furthermore, the acquired business may not perform as expected, which would impact our financial performance.\nExposure to successor liability and other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to successor liability and other liabilities relating to the historical operations of our predecessors or actions by an acquired business before the acquisition, including, but not limited to, anti-corruption, import-export, product-related and other health-based claims, environmental and other matters, which could also result in significant liabilities and/or civil or criminal penalties. We also may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses, including liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations of the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we previously determined. In these circumstances, we may be subject to indemnification obligations or our rights to indemnification from our predecessors or the sellers of the acquired businesses to us may not be sufficient in amount, scope or duration, or be sufficiently collectible to fully offset the possible liabilities. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increase in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur financial results reflect the seasonal nature of our operations.\nOur first and fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in new construction and home improvement markets decreases. Because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year, our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters. In addition, other weather patterns, such as hurricane season in the Southeast region of the United States typically occurring during the third and fourth quarters, can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state transportation regulations, as well as increases in the cost of fuel, could impose substantial costs on us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe use our own fleet of approximately 116 tractors, 10 trucks and 318 trailers to service customers throughout the United States. The U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) regulates our operations, and we are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service are subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service could increase our costs.\nIn addition, fuel costs are largely unpredictable and can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations since we rely on diesel fuel to operate our fleet. Changes in diesel fuel prices may increase our cost of operations and there is no guarantee that we can pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers.\nOur deferred tax assets could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (collectively, the \u201cDeferred Tax Assets\u201d). Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our Deferred Tax Assets to reduce our future taxable income and tax liabilities until such Deferred Tax Assets expire in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code provide\nan annual limitation on our ability to utilize our Deferred Tax Assets, as well as certain built-in losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership (as defined under the Code). While we have adopted a rights plan to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk to our ability to use our Deferred Tax Assets (see \u201cStockholder Rights Plan\u201d under Part II, Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information), we could experience a change in ownership in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership that are beyond our control, and any such subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the Code could further limit our ability to use our Deferred Tax Assets. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely impact our ability to offset future tax liabilities and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 87464, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "HBP"}
