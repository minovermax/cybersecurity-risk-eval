{"cik": "844965", "company": "TETRA TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCertain Business Risks\nAlthough it is not possible to identify all of the risks we encounter, we have identified the following significant risk factors that could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from any such results that might be projected, forecasted, or estimated by us in this report.\nMarket Risks\nThe demand and prices for our products and services are affected by several factors, including the supply, demand, and prices for oil and natural gas.\nDemand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control.\nAlthough oil prices steadily rose during late 2017 and early 2018, they fell during late 2018, with 2018 West Texas Intermediate oil prices dropping from a high of $76.90 per barrel in October 2018 to a low of $42.36 per barrel in December 2018. The West Texas Intermediate price averaged $57.05 per barrel during 2019. Over this\nsame period, U.S. natural gas prices have also been volatile, with the Henry Hub price ranging from a high of $4.93 per million British thermal units (\"MMBtu\") in November 2018 to a low of $2.03 per MMBtu in August 2019. Beginning in February 2020, there has been a severe drop in the price of oil. As of March 12, 2020, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil was $31.50 per barrel and the Henry Hub price for natural gas was $1.84 per MMBtu. The prolonged volatility and low levels of oil and natural gas prices have depressed levels of exploration, development, and production activity, and if the drop in oil and natural gas prices we have experienced in 2020 continues or further declines, the reduced prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Should current market conditions worsen for an extended period of time, we may be required to record additional asset impairments. Such potential impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include: the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, worldwide; governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; weather conditions, natural disasters, and health or similar issues, such as pandemics or epidemics; worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") and non-OPEC countries, such as Russia, to set and maintain oil production levels; the levels of oil production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC countries; oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and acceleration of the development of, and demand for, alternative energy sources. The recent announcement by Saudi Arabia of a significant reduction in its export prices as well as a recent announcement by Russia that previously agreed upon production cuts will expire on April 1, 2020, have contributed to the recent significant decline in the price of oil.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that began in early 2020 provides an illustrative example of how a pandemic or epidemic can also impact our operations and business by reducing global and national economic activity resulting in a decline in the demand for oil and for our products and services, and affecting the health of our workforce and rendering employees unable to work or travel. The price of oil has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2020, due in part to the factors discussed above and to concerns about the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its impact on the worldwide economy and demand for oil. In addition, if a pandemic or epidemic such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic were to impact a location where we have a high concentration of business and resources, our local workforce could be affected by such an occurrence or outbreak which could also significantly disrupt our operations and decrease our ability to provide services and products to our customers. The duration of the business disruption and related financial impact from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. If the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues for an extended period of time, it could materially adversely affect the demand for our products and services and our ability to operate our business in the manner and on the timelines previously planned. The extent to which the coronavirus (COVID-19) or other health pandemics or epidemics may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nCurrent debt and equity market conditions may continue to limit our ability, and the ability of our CCLP subsidiary, to obtain additional financing, including to pursue other business opportunities or refinancing existing indebtedness upon maturity.\nConditions in the market for debt and equity securities in the energy sector have increased the difficulty of obtaining debt or equity financing to grow our and CCLP's businesses and we expect the stock market decline beginning in March 2020 will make it more difficult to obtain such financing in the near future. As of December 31, 2019, the market price for our common stock was $1.96 per share and the market price per common unit of CCLP was $2.71. Due, in part to the recent stock market decline, the closing price of our common stock was $0.37 as of March 12, 2020. At the current price for our common stock, acquisition and financing transactions that involve the use of our common equity may be significantly dilutive to our stockholders. The issuance of new convertible debt or equity securities in the future for acquisition and financing transactions, if available, could be significantly dilutive to our stockholders and to CCLP current common unitholders. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, CCLP had approximately $649.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under its 7.25% Senior Notes and 7.50% Senior Secured Notes. We may have difficulty obtaining refinancing for our existing indebtedness upon maturity. Obtaining equity or debt financing in the current market environment is particularly difficult for CCLP, given its current levels of long-term debt.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, CCLP's total capital expenditures were $64.8 million, primarily consisting of growth capital expenditures to increase its compression services equipment fleet. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, CCLP's total cash balance was $2.4 million. CCLP expects that the combination of this $2.4 million of cash on hand at the beginning of 2020 and operating cash flows expected to be generated during the year will be sufficient to fund its anticipated 2020 capital expenditures without having to access the debt or equity markets. However, CCLP's ability to grow its business through capital expenditure or acquisition activities beyond these sources of financing may be significantly limited or curtailed. Without the ability to increase CCLP's compression equipment fleet or otherwise grow its operations, CCLP's ability to continue to retain customers whose compression services needs are expanding and to increase distributions to its common unitholders, including us, in the future may be limited.\nWe encounter, and expect to continue to encounter, intense competition in the sale of our products and services.\nWe compete with numerous companies in each of our operating segments, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Certain of our competitors have lower standards of quality, and offer equipment and services at lower prices than we do. Other competitors have newer equipment that is better suited to our customers' needs. Particularly during a period of low oil and natural gas pricing, to the extent competitors offer products or services at lower prices or higher quality, or more cost-effective products or services, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain of our customers may elect to perform services internally in lieu of using our services, which could also materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe profitability of our operations is dependent on other numerous factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results in general, and gross profit in particular, are determined by market conditions and the products and services we sell in any period. Other factors, such as heightened competition, changes in sales and distribution channels, availability of skilled labor and contract services, shortages in raw materials, or inability to obtain supplies at reasonable prices, may also affect the cost of sales and the fluctuation of gross margin in future periods.\nOther factors affecting our operating results and activity levels include oil and natural gas industry spending levels for exploration, completion, production, development, and acquisition activities, and impairments of long-lived assets. The significant decline in oil prices since the beginning of 2020 is expected to adversely affect such levels of spending in the oil and natural gas industry. In particular, Completion Fluids & Products Division profitability in future periods will continue to be affected by the mix of its products and services, including the timing of TETRA CS Neptune completion fluid projects, which are also dependent upon the success of customer offshore exploration and drilling efforts. Several of our customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2020 in light of the current decreased prices of oil and natural gas. Such industry capital expenditure reductions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for many of our products and services. This has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our revenues and results of operations. A large concentration of our operating activities is located in the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico. Our revenues and profitability are particularly dependent upon oil and natural gas industry activity and spending levels in this region. Our operations may also be affected by technological advances, cost of capital, and tax policies. Adverse changes in any of these other factors may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in the economic environment have resulted, and could further result, in significant impairments of certain of our long-lived assets.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we review the carrying value of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, based on their expected future cash flows. The impact of reduced expected future cash flow could require the write-down of all or a portion of the carrying value for these assets, which would result in additional impairments, resulting in decreased earnings. During the two year period ending December 31, 2019, we have recorded a total of $98.8 million of impairments and other charges for long-lived assets other than goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment of $91.6 million in our Completion Fluids & Products Division related to our El Dorado, Arkansas calcium chloride production plant facility assets as a result of a reduction in the cost of raw materials for certain of our other chemical production plants and reduced demand for calcium chloride from the El Dorado plant due to general market conditions in the oil and gas industry. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we also recorded an impairment of $0.3 million related to certain equipment assets in our Water & Flowback Services Division. During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded impairments of $2.3 million in our Compression\nDivision on certain units of our low-horsepower compression fleet, reflecting our decision to dispose of these units upon management's determination that refurbishing this equipment was not economic given limited current and forecasted demand for such equipment. During the third quarter of 2018, as a result of decreased expected future cash flows from a specific customer contract, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment of $2.9 million of an identified intangible asset within the Water & Flowback Services segment. Depressed commodity prices and/or adverse changes in the economic environment could result in a greater decrease in the demand for many of our products and services, which could impact the expected utilization rates of certain of our long-lived assets, including plant facilities, operating locations, and operating equipment.\nAs part of our internal annual business outlook for each of our reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2019, we considered changes in the global economic environment that negatively impacted our stock price and market capitalization. As part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing for our Water Management reporting unit (part of our Water & Flowback Services Division) as of December 31, 2019, the only reporting unit with goodwill, we determined that the fair value of the Water Management reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and the remaining balance of $25.9 million of goodwill was impaired.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers for specific products and equipment necessary to provide certain of our products and services.\nWe sell a variety of CBFs to the oil and gas industry and non-energy markets, including calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, formate-based brines, and our TETRA CS Neptune fluids, some of which we manufacture and some of which are purchased from third parties. Sales of these products contribute significantly to our revenues. In our manufacture of calcium chloride, we use brines, hydrochloric acid, and other raw materials purchased from third parties. In our manufacture of brominated CBF products, we use elemental bromine, hydrobromic acid, and other raw materials that are purchased from third parties. We rely on Lanxess as a supplier of bromine for our brominated CBF products as well as tail brine for our El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant. Although we have long-term supply agreements with Lanxess, if we were unable to acquire these raw materials at reasonable prices for a prolonged period, our Completion Fluids & Products Division business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe fabrication of CCLP's compression packages and our production testing, well monitoring, sand separation, water management, and rig cooling equipment requires the purchase of various components, some of which we obtain from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers exposes us to the risk of price increases, inferior component quality, or an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. The profitability or future growth of our Compression and Water & Flowback Services Divisions may be adversely affected due to our dependence on these key suppliers.\nOperating and Technological Risks\nWe have technological and age-obsolescence risk, both with our products and services as well as with our equipment assets.\nNew drilling, completion, and production technologies and equipment are constantly evolving. If we are unable to adapt to new advances in technology or replace older assets with new assets, we are at risk of losing customers and market share. Certain equipment, such as a portion of our production testing equipment fleet, may be inadequate to meet the needs of our customers in certain markets. The permanent replacement or upgrade of any of our equipment will require significant capital. Due to the unique nature of many of these assets, finding a suitable or acceptable replacement may be difficult and/or cost prohibitive. The replacement or enhancement of these assets over the next several years may be necessary in order for us to effectively compete in the current marketplace.\nOur operations involve significant operating risks and insurance coverage may not be available or cost-effective.\nWe are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the oilfield service industry, including automobile accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, formation collapse, mechanical problems, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental accidents. Environmental accidents could include, but are not limited to oil and produced water spills, gas leaks or ruptures, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, or well fluids, or discharges of CBFs or toxic gases or other pollutants. These operating hazards may also include injuries to employees and third parties\nduring the performance of our operations. In the past, our Compression Division has on occasion experienced fires that have damaged or destroyed certain of its compression fleet, and similar accidents or fires could reoccur in the future.\nWe have maintained a policy of insuring our risks of operational hazards that we believe is customary in the industry. We believe that the limits of insurance coverage we have purchased are consistent with the exposures we face and the nature of our products and services. Due to economic conditions in the insurance industry, from time to time, we have increased our self-insured retentions for certain policies in order to minimize the increased costs of coverage, or we have reduced our limits of insurance coverage for, or not procured, certain coverage. In certain areas of our business, we, from time to time, have elected to assume the risk of loss for specific assets. To the extent we suffer losses or claims that are not covered, or are only partially covered by insurance, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWeather-Related Risks\nCertain of our operations are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions.\nIn certain markets, the Water & Flowback Services Division\u2019s onshore water management services can be dependent on adequate water supplies being available to its customers. To the extent severe drought or other weather-related conditions prevent our customers from obtaining needed water, frac water operations may not be possible and our Water & Flowback Services Division business may be negatively affected.\nSevere weather, including named windstorms, can cause damage and disruption to our businesses.\nA portion of our operations is susceptible to adverse weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, including hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. Even if we do not experience direct damage from storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations, because we are unable to operate or our customers or suppliers may curtail their activities due to damage to their wells, platforms, pipelines, and facilities. From time to time, our onshore operations are also negatively affected by adverse weather conditions, including sustained rain and flooding.\nFinancial Risks\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nour operational performance;\n\u2022\nsupply, demand, and prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe activity levels of our customers;\n\u2022\ndeviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance or analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by research analysts that cover us and other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nrisks related to acquisitions and our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nuncertainty about current global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother general economic conditions.\nDuring 2019, the closing price for our common stock ranged from a high of $2.68 per share to a low of $1.11 per share. In connection with the recent stock market decline that began in March 2020, the closing market price of our common stock has declined below $1.00 per share with a closing price of $0.37 per share on March 12, 2020. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to operating performance and are attributable, in part, to outside factors such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its potential impact on the world economy. The volatility of our common stock may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock when you want at attractive prices.\nWe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). We are required to meet the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standards, including a requirement that the average closing price of our common stock not be below $1.00 per share over any consecutive thirty trading-day period. As indicated above, the closing market price\nof our common stock was recently below $1.00. The NYSE listing standards also provide that we will not not be in compliance if our market capitalization over any consecutive thirty trading-day period is less than $50 million and, at the same time our stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $50 million. As of December 31, 2019, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $34.4 million and our market capitalization as of March 12, 2020 was $46.5 million. If we are unable to meet these listing standards and are unable to cure any such non-compliance within the applicable cure period provided by the NYSE, the NYSE will delist our common stock. In that event, it is possible that our common stock would be quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board. This could have negative consequences for us, including reduced liquidity for shareholders, reduced trading levels, limited availability of market quotations or analyst coverage, stricter trading rules for brokers trading our common stock, and reduced access to financing alternatives. We also could be subject to greater state securities regulation if our common stock is no longer listed on a national exchange.\nOur long-term debt agreements contain covenants and other provisions that restrict our ability to take certain actions and may limit our ability to grow our business in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total long-term debt outstanding (excluding CCLP) of $204.6 million consisted of the carrying amount outstanding under our credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Credit Agreement\u201d) and our Asset-Based Credit Agreement (the \"ABL Credit Agreement\"), both of which we entered into in September 2018. In addition, in June 2018, CCLP entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"CCLP Credit Agreement\"). As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated balance sheet includes $638.2 million carrying amount of long-term debt of CCLP, which consisted of (i) $344.2 million carrying amount under its 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \"CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes\"), (ii) $291.4 million carrying amount of CCLP's 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes\"), and (iii) $2.6 million carrying amount under the CCLP Credit Agreement. Debt service costs related to outstanding long-term debt represents a significant use of our and CCLP's operating cash flows and could increase our and CCLP's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of TETRA and certain of its subsidiaries (other than CCLP) to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, (i) incurring debt, (ii) granting liens, (iii) engaging in mergers and other fundamental changes, (iv) making investments, (v) entering into, or amending, transactions with affiliates, (vi) paying dividends and making other restricted payments, (vii) prepaying other indebtedness, and (viii) selling assets. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains a provision that may require a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur. The Term Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that the borrowers comply at the end of each fiscal quarter with a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Credit Agreement) of 1.00 to 1.00.\nThe CCLP Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict CCLP's ability to take certain actions including, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, (i) incurring debt, (ii) granting liens, (iii) making investments, (iv) entering into or amending transactions with affiliates, (v) paying dividends, and (vi) selling assets. The CCLP Credit Agreement also contains a provision that requires compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the CCLP Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 in the event that certain conditions associated with outstanding borrowings and cash availability occur.\nIn addition, the indentures governing the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes and the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes (the \"CCLP Indentures\") contain customary covenants restricting CCLP's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (i) pay distributions on, purchase, or redeem its common units, make certain investments and other restricted payments, or purchase or redeem any subordinated debt; (ii) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain kinds of preferred equity securities; (iii) create or incur certain liens securing indebtedness; (iv) sell assets, including dispositions of the CCLP 7.50% Senior Secured Notes Collateral; (v) consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into, or amend or modify transactions with affiliates; and (vii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from CCLP's restricted subsidiaries to CCLP. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions, including certain provisions permitting CCLP, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to transfer assets to certain of its unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur continuing ability to comply with covenants in our Long-Term Debt Agreements depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flow.\nThe debt levels of our CCLP subsidiary have resulted in a significant use of its operating cash flows being used to fund debt service requirements, resulting in less cash available for distributions and to fund capital expenditures.\nIn March 2018, CCLP issued an aggregate $350.0 million of its 7.50% Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from which were partially used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of $258.0 million under CCLP's previous bank credit facility, which was then terminated. While the termination of the CCLP previous bank credit agreement removed certain financial covenant requirements, the issuance of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes increased CCLP's aggregate amount of long-term debt outstanding as well as increased the aggregate interest rate of its debt outstanding. This increase in CCLP indebtedness has increased its total interest expense, which in turn reduces its cash available to fund capital expenditures or for distribution to CCLP's common unitholders, including us. CCLP's ability to service its indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. If CCLP operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, CCLP may be forced to consider taking actions such as reducing or delaying is business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, delaying the increase of distributions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. CCLP may not be able to take any of these courses of action. Given its need to fund capital expenditures and debt service requirements, there can be no assurance that CCLP will increase its distributions to its common unitholders, including us.\nWe have continuing exposure to abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with oil and gas properties previously owned by Maritech.\nFrom 2001 to 2012, our former subsidiary, Maritech Resources, Inc. (\"Maritech\"), sold various oil and gas producing properties in numerous transactions to different buyers. In connection with those sales, the buyers generally assumed the decommissioning liabilities associated with the properties sold (the \"Legacy Liabilities\") and generally became the successor operator. In some cases, Maritech retained certain liabilities and we provided guaranties of Maritech's retained liabilities. Some buyers of these Maritech properties subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers, who also assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, including decommissioning liabilities, and these buyers also typically became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the decommissioning work required, a previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform operations to satisfy the decommissioning liabilities. As a result of the third-party indemnity agreements and corporate guaranties we have previously provided to the U.S. Department of the Interior and to other private third-parties as the former parent company of Maritech, we may be responsible for satisfying these decommissioning obligations if they are not satisfied by the current owners and operators of the properties or by Maritech. Significant decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in these previous sales remain unperformed. If oil and natural gas pricing levels continue to be depressed or further deteriorate, one or more of these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work required on a property previously owned by Maritech. If these buyers, or any successor owners of the Maritech properties, are unable to satisfy and extinguish their decommissioning liabilities due to bankruptcy or other liquidity issues, the US Department of the Interior may seek to impose those decommissioning obligations on Maritech and on us due to our third party indemnity agreements, and contractual commitments and guaranties issued from time to time by us to the US Department of the Interior and various third parties. The amount of cash necessary to satisfy these obligations could be significant and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn March 2018, pursuant to a series of transactions, Maritech sold the remaining offshore leases held by Maritech to Orinoco Natural Resources, LLC (\"Orinoco\") and, immediately thereafter, we sold all equity interest in Maritech to Orinoco. The assignments for six of the offshore leases conveyed to Orinoco have not been approved by the US Department of the Interior and Maritech remains an owner of record for these leases. Maritech also remains a recognized operator of a portion of four other offshore properties. Under the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement, Orinoco assumed all of Maritech's decommissioning liabilities related to the leases conveyed to Orinoco (the \u201cOrinoco Lease Liabilities\u201d) and, under the Maritech Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, Orinoco assumed all other liabilities of Maritech, including the Legacy Liabilities, subject to limited exceptions unrelated to the decommissioning liabilities. Pursuant to a Bonding Agreement executed in connection with such purchase agreements, Orinoco provided non-revocable bonds in the aggregate amount of approximately $46.8\nmillion to secure the performance of certain of Maritech\u2019s decommissioning obligations related to the Orinoco Lease Liabilities and certain of Maritech\u2019s remaining current decommissioning obligations (not including the Legacy Liabilities). Orinoco was required to replace the initial bonds delivered at closing with other non-revocable performance bonds in two stages. The first set of replacement bonds were required to be delivered within 90 days following closing and the second set of replacement bonds were required to be delivered within 180 days following closing. The replacement bonds had to meet certain additional requirements and were required to be in the aggregate sum of $47.0 million. In the event Orinoco did not provide the first or second set of replacement bonds, Orinoco was required to make cash escrow payments. Among the other requirements of the final replacement bonds was that they must provide coverage for all of the asset retirement obligations of Maritech instead of only relating to specific properties. The payment obligations of Orinoco under the Bonding Agreement are guaranteed by Thomas M. Clarke and Ana M. Clarke pursuant to a separate guaranty agreement (the \u201cClarke Bonding Guaranty Agreement\u201d). Orinoco has not delivered such replacement bonds and neither it nor the Clarkes has made any of the escrow payments required pursuant to the terms of the Bonding Agreement. We filed a lawsuit against Orinoco and the Clarkes to enforce the terms of the Bonding Agreement and the Clarke Bonding Guaranty Agreement. A summary judgment was initially granted in favor of Orinoco and the Clarkes, which dismissed our claims against Orinoco under the Bonding Agreement and against the Clarkes under the Clarke Bonding Guaranty Agreement. We filed an appeal and also asked the trial court to grant a new trial on the summary judgment to modify the judgment because we believe this judgment should not have been granted. On November 5, 2019, the trial court signed an order granting our motion for new trial and vacating the prior order granting summary judgment for Orinoco and the Clarkes. The parties are awaiting direction from the court on a new scheduling order and/or trial setting. The non-revocable performance bonds delivered at the closing remain in effect.\nIf in the future we become liable for decommissioning liabilities associated with any property covered by either an initial bond or stage 1 permanent bond, the Bonding Agreement provides that if we call any of the initial bonds or the stage 1 permanent bonds to satisfy such liability and the amount of the bond payment is not sufficient to pay for such liability, Orinoco will pay us for the additional amount required. To the extent Orinoco is unable to cover any such deficiency or we become liable for a significant portion of the Legacy Liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nPossible changes in the US Department of Interior's supplemental bonding and financial assurance requirements may increase our risks associated with the decommissioning obligations pertaining to oil and gas properties previously owned by Maritech.\nRecent and additional anticipated changes to the supplemental bonding and financial assurance program managed by the US Department of the Interior could require all oil and gas owners and operators with infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico to provide additional supplemental bonds or other acceptable financial assurance for decommissioning liabilities. These changes have the potential to adversely impact the financial condition of lease owners and operators in the Gulf of Mexico and increase the number of such owners and operators seeking bankruptcy protection, given current oil and gas prices. In July 2016, the US Department of the Interior issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (\u201c2016 NTL\u201d) that strengthened requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lease owners and operators to assure that sufficient security is available to satisfy and extinguish decommissioning obligations with respect to offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities. The 2016 NTL, which became effective in September 2016, eliminated the past practice of waiving supplemental bonding requirements where lease owners or operators, or their guarantors, could demonstrate a certain level of financial strength. Instead, under the 2016 NTL, the US Department of the Interior indicated that it would allow lease owners and operators to \"self-insure,\" but only up to 10% of their \"tangible net worth,\" which is defined as the difference between a company\u2019s total assets and the value of all liabilities and intangible assets. It is unclear how this self-insurance allowance relates to lease owners or operators with a guarantor presently in place. In addition, the 2016 NTL is being held in abeyance by the US Department of the Interior, which creates additional and significant uncertainty for Gulf of Mexico lease owners and operators and for us through the third party indemnity agreements we have provided for Maritech liabilities to the US Department of the Interior and/or to third parties through our private guarantees.\nThe US Department of the Interior also recently increased its estimates for decommissioning liabilities in the Gulf of Mexico, causing the potential need for additional supplemental bonding and/or other financial assurances to be dramatically increased. When coupled with the volatile and currently low prices of oil and gas, it is difficult to predict the impact of the rule and regulatory changes already promulgated and as may be forthcoming by the US Department of the Interior relating to financial assurance for decommissioning liabilities. The US Department of the Interior's revisions to its supplemental bonding process could result in demands for the posting of increased\nfinancial assurances by owners and operators in the Gulf of Mexico, including Maritech, Orinoco and the other entities to whom Maritech divested its Gulf of Mexico assets, but such demands cannot be directly placed on us due to the fact that we are only a former parent company of Maritech and are only a guarantor as opposed to an actual lease owner or operator. This may force lease owners and operators of leases and other infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the costs of which could be significant. Moreover, recent and anticipated changes to the bonding and financial assurance program for the Gulf of Mexico are likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of lease owners and operators of infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, which will in turn force these owners and operators to seek additional surety bonds which could exceed the surety bond market\u2019s ability to provide such additional financial assurance. Lease owners and operators who have already leveraged their assets could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety may have about the priority of their liens on their collateral as well as the creditworthiness of such lease owners and operators. Consequently, anticipated changes to the bonding and financial assurance program could result in additional lease owners and operators in the Gulf of Mexico initiating bankruptcy proceedings, which in turn could result in the US Department of the Interior seeking to impose decommissioning costs on predecessors in interest and providers of third party indemnity agreements in the event that the current lease owners and/or operators cannot meet their decommissioning obligations. As a result, this could increase the risk that we may be required to step in and satisfy remaining decommissioning liabilities of Maritech and any buyer of the Maritech properties, including Orinoco, through our third party indemnity agreements and private guarantees, which obligations could be significant and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant credit risks.\nWe face credit risk associated with the significant amounts of accounts receivable we have with our customers in the energy industry. Many of our customers, particularly those associated with our onshore operations, are small- to medium-sized oil and gas operators that may be more susceptible to declines in oil and gas commodity prices or generally increased operating expenses than larger companies. Our ability to collect from our customers is impacted by the current volatile oil and natural gas price environment and we may face increased credit risks if the current reduced price of oil continues for an extended period of time.\nAs discussed in the preceding risk factors, we face the risk of having to satisfy decommissioning liabilities on properties presently or formerly owned by Maritech. Continued decreased oil and natural gas prices have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for oil and gas lease owners and operators, including companies that have purchased Maritech properties or are joint-owners in properties presently and formerly owned by Maritech and from whom Maritech is entitled to receive payments upon satisfaction of certain decommissioning obligations. Consequently, we face credit risk associated with the ability of these companies to satisfy their decommissioning liabilities. If these companies are unable to satisfy their obligations, it will increase the possibility that we will become liable for such decommissioning obligations in the future.\nOur operating results and cash flows for certain of our subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency risk.\nThe operations of certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, the Mexican peso, and the Argentinian peso. Our plans to grow our international operations could cause this exposure from fluctuating currencies to increase. Historically, exchange rates of foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar, and this exchange rate volatility is expected to continue. Significant fluctuations in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nWe and CCLP are exposed to interest rate risks with regard to our respective credit facility debt and future refinancing thereof.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $1.0 million outstanding under our ABL Credit Agreement and $220.5 million outstanding under our Term Credit Agreement. CCLP has a total of $3.5 million outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement. These credit facilities consist of floating rate loans that bear interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or an alternate base rate. Accordingly, whenever we and CCLP have amounts outstanding under these facilities, our respective cash flows and results of operations will be subject to interest rate risk exposure associated with the debt balance outstanding. We currently are not a party to an interest rate swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk.\nOur ABL Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2023. Our Term Loan Agreement is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2025. The CCLP Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on June 29, 2023. CCLP's 7.25% Senior Notes, which mature August 15, 2022, and CCLP's 7.50% Senior Secured Notes, which mature April 1, 2025, bear interest at fixed interest rates. There can be no assurance that financial market conditions or borrowing terms at the times these existing debt agreements are renegotiated will be as favorable as the current terms and interest rates. We may be unable to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or other purposes.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Political Risks\nOur operations are subject to extensive and evolving U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements that increase our operating costs and expose us to potential fines, penalties, and litigation.\nLaws and regulations govern our operations, including those relating to corporate governance, employees, taxation, fees, importation and exportation restrictions, environmental affairs, health and safety, and the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, use, and sale of chemical products. Certain foreign countries impose additional restrictions on our activities, such as currency restrictions and restrictions on various labor practices. These laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and stringent, and compliance is becoming increasingly expensive. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, and injunctions. Third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with certain laws and regulations. It is possible that increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.\nThe EPA is studying the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, a process used by the U.S. oil and gas industry in the development of certain oil and gas reservoirs. Specifically, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Several states have adopted regulations that require operators to disclose the chemical constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. We cannot predict whether any federal, state or local laws or regulations will be enacted regarding hydraulic fracturing, and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on oil and gas operators through the adoption of new laws and regulations, the domestic demand for certain of our products and services could be decreased or subject to delays,\nWe operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At this time, we cannot predict the full impact that other regulatory actions that may be mandated by the federal government may have on our operations or the operations of our customers. Other governmental or regulatory actions could further reduce our revenues and increase our operating costs, including the cost to insure offshore operations, resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOur onshore and offshore operations expose us to risks such as the potential for harmful substances escaping into the environment and causing damages or injuries, which could be substantial. We maintain limited environmental liability insurance covering named locations and environmental risks associated with contract services for oil and gas operations. We could be materially and adversely affected by an enforcement proceeding or a claim that is not covered or is only partially covered by insurance.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements that impose additional restrictions on the industry may adversely affect our financial results. Regulators are becoming more focused on air emissions from oil and gas operations, including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\"). In particular, the focus on GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our financial results if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced\neconomic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs, capital spending requirements, or additional operating restrictions for us, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIn addition to increasing our risk of environmental liability, the rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has accelerated demand for our products and services in some of the markets we serve.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe EPA has adopted various regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. Such EPA rules regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and require a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and from certain large stationary sources. The EPA rules also require so-called \u201cgreen\u201d completions at hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Under the current administration, in 2019 the EPA proposed rules to loosen these requirements, but those rules have not been finalized. In addition, the EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries, as well as from certain oil and gas production facilities.\nThe EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocal internal combustion engines and more recently the EPA adopted regulations that establish air emission controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including NSPS as well as emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants. Certain CCLP compressor packages are subject to these new requirements and additional control equipment and maintenance operations are required. However, these rules are the subject of a recently proposed rule to modify or remove certain requirements. While we do not believe that compliance with current regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on the business, additional regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs.\nIn addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the Paris Agreement. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or a separate agreement. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. In November 2019 the U.S. submitted formal notice required under the Paris Agreement. The withdrawal is scheduled to take effect November 4, 2020. To the extent that the other countries implement the Paris Agreement or the United States imposes other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our facilities and operations could require us to incur costs. The U.S. Congress (\"Congress\") has considered and almost one-half of the states have adopted legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of GHGs from a wide range of sources. Any such legislation could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and, in turn, demand for our products and services. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nOur operations in foreign countries exposes us to complex regulations and may present us with new obstacles to growth.\nWe plan to continue to grow both in the United States and in foreign countries. We have established operations in Argentina, Brazil, Finland, Ghana, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as other foreign countries. Foreign operations carry special risks. Our business in the countries in which we currently operate and those in which we may operate in the future could be limited or disrupted by:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriating cash back to the United States;\n\u2022\nthe impact of compliance with anti-corruption laws on our operations and competitive position in affected countries and the risk that actions taken by us or our agents may violate those laws;\n\u2022\ngovernment controls and government actions, such as expropriation of assets and changes in legal and regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nimport and export license requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and taxes; and\n\u2022\nour limited knowledge of these markets or our inability to protect our interests.\nWe and our affiliates operate in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist. While we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner, there is a risk of violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K Bribery Act, or laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions or other applicable anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. Violation of these laws could result in monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business.\nForeign governments and agencies often establish permit and regulatory standards different from those in the U.S. If we cannot obtain foreign regulatory approvals, or if we cannot obtain them in a timely manner, our growth and profitability from foreign operations could be adversely affected.\nOur operations in Argentina expose us to the changing economic, legal, and political environments there, including the changing regulations over repatriation of cash generated from our operations in Argentina.\nThe current economic, legal, and political environment in Argentina and devaluation of the Argentinian peso have created increased economic instability for foreign investment in Argentina. Fiscal and monetary expansion in Argentina led to numerous devaluations of the Argentinian peso since 2013. Additional currency adjustment may be necessary to help boost the current Argentina economy, but may be accompanied by fiscal and monetary tightening, including additional restrictions on the purchase of U.S. dollars in Argentina. On June 30, 2018, we determined the economy in Argentina to be highly inflationary. As a result of this determination and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, on July 1, 2018, the functional currency of our operations in Argentina was changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nAs a result of our operations in Argentina, consolidated revenues and operating cash flow generated in Argentina have increased over the past three years. The process of repatriating this cash to the U.S. is subject to complex regulations. There can be no assurances that our Argentinian operations will not expose us to a loss of liquidity, foreign exchange losses, and other potential financial impacts.\nRegulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing in the countries where we and our customers operate could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells that may reduce demand for our services.\nHydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process in the U.S. For example, the EPA (i) asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities, (ii) published final rules under the federal CAA in 2012 and published additional final regulations in June 2016 governing methane and volatile organic compound performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during for the oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry (however, rules have been proposed in 2019 to modify or rescind some of these requirements), (iii) in June 2016 published an effluent limitations final rule prohibiting the discharge of waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations before discharging to a treatment plant, and (iv) in 2014 published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") published a final rule that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. BLM has issued a final rule rescinding the 2015 action; however, this new rule remains subject to legal challenge.\nThe Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, our customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our customers in the production of oil and gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of additional regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nRegulatory initiatives relating to the protection of endangered or threatened species in the United States, or in other countries where we operate, could have an adverse impact on our and our customers\u2019 ability to expand operations.\nIn the U.S., the Endangered Species Act (the \u201cESA\u201d) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the \u201cMBTA\u201d). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where we or our customers operate, both our and our customers\u2019 abilities to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or be forced to incur material additional costs.\nThe designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our customers\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future oil and gas development activity in affected areas. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers might conduct operations could result in limitations or prohibitions on our operations and could adversely impact our business.\nOur proprietary rights may be violated or compromised, which could damage our operations.\nWe own numerous patents, patent applications, and unpatented trade secret technologies in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of these rights. In addition, independent third parties may develop competitive or superior technologies.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, customer invoicing, employee information, and other business processes. We outsource certain business process functions to third-party providers and similarly rely on these third parties to maintain and store confidential information on their systems. The failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nAlthough we allocate significant resources to protect our information technology systems, we have experienced varying degrees of cyber-incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including viruses, worms, other destructive software, process breakdowns, phishing and other malicious activities. On January 6, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security issued a public warning that indicated companies in the energy industry might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Such breaches have in the past and could again in the future result in unauthorized access to information including customer, supplier, employee, or other company confidential data. We do carry insurance against these risks, although the potential damages we might incur could exceed our available insurance coverage. We also invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We continue to experience and expect to continue to experience, cyber security threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response.", "PERMNO": 76127, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "TTI"}
