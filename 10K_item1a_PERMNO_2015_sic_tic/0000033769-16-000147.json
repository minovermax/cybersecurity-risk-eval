RISK FACTORS.\nThe risk factors presented below may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial position and cash flows. The categories listed below are for information purposes only and do not signify that any risk should or should not be included in one or more of the other categories, or that any category or risk is more significant than any other risk. In addition to the risk factors presented below, changes in general economic conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns, demographic trends and consumer confidence in the economy, which affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and retail purchases in general, may have a material adverse effect on us. Our actual results could vary significantly from any results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:\nA. OPERATIONS\nGeneral economic, business and societal conditions as well as those specific to the restaurant or retail industries that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others, consumer income, interest rates, inflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, minimum wage laws, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry, purchase of food products, and the retail industry, are affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant and food products concepts, and consumer spending patterns.\nDiscretionary consumer spending, which is critical to our success, is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Global economic factors and a weak economic recovery have reduced consumer confidence and affected consumers\u2019 ability or desire to spend disposable income. Deterioration in the economy or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as unemployment levels, reduced home values, investment losses, inflation, fuel and other energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, tax rates and changes in tax laws, may adversely affect our business. This would be due to a reduction in overall consumer spending or by causing customers to reduce the frequency with which they shop and dine out. This could also cause a shift of their spending to our competitors or to products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices, all of which could result in lower revenues, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.\nConcerns relating to food safety, food-borne illness, pandemics and other diseases could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe dedicate substantial resources and provide training to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve or sell. Nevertheless, we face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination, which are common both in the restaurant and food products industries, and the food supply chain, and cannot be completely eliminated. We rely on our network of suppliers and co-packers to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients, until delivery to our restaurants and plants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which could be difficult to detect and put the safety of our food in jeopardy. We freshly prepare many of our menu items at our restaurants, which may put us at greater risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some of our competitors who use processed foods. The risk of food-borne illness may also increase whenever our menu items are served outside of our control, such as by third party food delivery services, customer take out or at catered events.\nIf a pathogen (i.e., Ebola, \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d \u201cSARS,\u201d \u201cswine flu,\u201d Zika virus, avian influenza, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, norovirus or other virus), or bacteria (i.e., such as salmonella, listeria or E.coli, or if parasites or other toxins, infect the food supply or are believed to have infected the food supply), the demand, availability and price of certain food items may be adversely impacted. Additionally, if our customers or employees become infected with a pathogen that is transmittable by human-to-human, food-to-human or human-to-food contact, customers may avoid our restaurants or it may become difficult to adequately staff our restaurants, the occurrence of either or both of which may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Any adverse food safety occurrence may result in litigation against us by consumers, governmental authorities and others. Although we carry liability and other insurance coverage to mitigate against these risks, not all risks of this nature are fully insurable and, even if insured, the negative publicity associated with such an event may cause a decrease in customer patronage which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn addition, any adverse food safety event could result in mandatory or voluntary product withdrawals or recalls and regulatory and other investigations, any of which could disrupt our operations, increase our costs, require us to respond to findings from regulatory agencies that may divert resources and assets, and result in potential civil fines and penalties as well as other legal action. In extreme cases, adverse findings could lead to criminal fines and penalties.\nWe are dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified employees while also controlling labor and health care costs.\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of qualified restaurant and plant employees. Availability of employees varies widely from location to location. The industries we do business in experience high levels of turnover, which is further impacted by the fact many employees are in entry-level or part-time positions, which also are typically impacted with high rates of turnover. If restaurant or plant management and staff turnover were to increase, we could suffer higher direct costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining replacement personnel. Management turnover as well as general shortages in the labor pool can cause our restaurants to be operated with reduced staff, which negatively affects our\nability to provide appropriate service levels to our customers. Competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruiting and training expenses.\nOur ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation, health care legislation, payroll taxes and changing demographics. Many of our employees are hourly workers whose wages are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage or changes to tip credits. Tip credits are the amounts an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when the employer calculates the employee\u2019s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes. Increases in minimum wage levels and changes to the tip credit regulations have been made and continue to be proposed at both federal and state levels. As minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. If competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.\nHealth care costs, in particular, continue to rise and are especially difficult to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims or an unusually high number of severe medical claims or other unfavorable fluctuations in the severity or frequency of such claims may cause health care costs to vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. We act as a self-insurer under our health and dental plans and mitigate losses by carrying stop loss coverage. However, given the unpredictable nature of actual claims trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (\u201cPPACA\u201d) was enacted in 2010. Until the uncertainty surrounding PPACA is finally resolved and the implementation and administration of PPACA is more fully matured, there remains a risk that PPACA may cause our health care costs to rise in the near and long-term future.\nThe price and availability of operating resources, and for commodities such as food, ingredients, and utilities used by our restaurants and plants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the general risks of inflation, and our operating profit margins and results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price, quality and availability of food and other commodities, ingredients, utilities and other related costs over which we have limited control. Fluctuations in economic conditions, weather, demand and other factors affect the availability, quality and cost of the ingredients and products that we buy. The increased global demand for corn, wheat and dairy products has increased feed costs for poultry and livestock. Additionally, the cost of commodities subject to governmental regulation, such as dairy and corn, can be even more susceptible to price fluctuation than other products. Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change may result in more severe, volatile weather, which could result in greater volatility in product supply and price. Furthermore, many of the products that we use and their costs are interrelated.\nWith the primary exception of sows, substantially all of our food and supplies are available from multiple qualified suppliers, which helps to mitigate our risk of commodity availability and obtain competitive prices. We negotiate agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We also periodically evaluate hedging vehicles to assist us in managing our risk and variability in these categories. Although these vehicles and markets may be available to us, we may choose not to enter into contracts due to pricing volatility, excessive risk premiums, hedge inefficiencies or other factors.\nSows are the most important raw material used to produce our pork sausage products in our BEF Foods segment. We procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in many states and Canada. The live sow market is volatile in terms of the number of sows available and the current market price. The live sow market is dependent upon supply and demand for pork products, as well as such commodities as corn and soybean meal prices (the major food supply for sows), weather and farmers\u2019 access to capital. We also use pork trimmings. The pork trimmings market is also volatile in terms of availability and market price. Higher sow and pork trimmings costs could adversely affect the BEF Foods segment\u2019s profitability, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along any portion of the increased costs to our consumers in a timely manner, or at all.\nIn addition, food safety concerns, widespread outbreaks of livestock and poultry diseases, and product recalls, all of which are out of our control, and, in many instances, unpredictable, could also increase our costs and possibly affect the supply of livestock and poultry products. Our operating margins are also affected, whether as a result of general inflation or otherwise, by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas and electricity, on which our locations depend for much of their energy supply.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond effectively to one or more adverse changes in any of these operating costs could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, because we provide a moderately-priced product, we\nmay not seek to or we may be unable to pass along price increases to our customers sufficient to completely offset cost increases\nWe outsource certain business processes and product manufacturing to third-party vendors that subjects us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome of our business processes and the manufacturing of certain products are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include distribution of food and retail products to our restaurant locations, credit and debit card authorization and processing, gift card sales and balance tracking, employee payroll card services, health care and workers\u2019 compensation claims processing, wage and related tax credit documentation and approval, guest satisfaction survey programs, employee engagement surveys and externally hosted business software applications. We cannot ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities, and there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on certain technology licensed from third parties and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in managing our Internet sites and providing services to our guests and employees. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain these technology licenses could adversely affect our business.\nUnfavorable publicity could harm our business. In addition, our failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the impact of social media could materially impact our business.\nBusinesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, poor service, food-borne illness, product defects, personal injury, adverse health effects (including obesity), data breaches or other concerns. Even when the allegations or complaints are not valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or products, or only to a single restaurant or product, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Additionally, negative publicity from online social network postings may also result from actual or alleged incidents taking place in our restaurants. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety or customer service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully and sufficiently raise menu and food products prices to offset increased commodity and labor costs could result in a decline in margins.\nWe utilize price increases for menu offerings and food products to help offset commodity cost increases, including increased costs for wholesale food, raw materials, distribution, minimum wages, employee benefits, construction, fuel, utility, and other costs. We may not be able to pass through these or other additional costs to customers in the form of increased pricing. Also, because we offer moderately priced food, we may not be able to, or we may choose not to, pass along price increases to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause many of our restaurants are concentrated in certain geographic areas there could be a material adverse effect on our operations by regional economic conditions, severe weather and other events.\nThe concentration of many of our existing restaurants in particular regions of the United States could affect our operating results in a number of ways. For example, our results of operations may be adversely affected by economic conditions in that region, the local labor market and regional competition. A majority of our Bob Evans Restaurants are located in Ohio and other parts of the Midwest, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic conditions, natural disasters, severe weather and other events in this region. Our business is subject to seasonal adverse weather conditions (especially between October and March) that may at times affect regions in which our restaurants are located, regions that produce raw ingredients for our restaurants, or locations of our distribution network. As a result, our quarterly and yearly results have varied in the past, and we believe that our quarterly operating results will vary in the future. In addition, adverse weather conditions could cause us to experience closures, repair and restoration costs, food spoilage, and other significant reopening costs as well as increased food costs and delayed supply shipments, any of which would adversely affect our business. Additionally, during periods of extreme temperatures (either hot or cold), or precipitation, many individuals choose to stay indoors. These conditions would impact our transaction counts in our restaurants and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur BEF Foods segment\u2019s business is dependent upon our ability to produce a significant number of items and relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales.\nOur BEF Foods segment\u2019s business is dependent upon our ability to produce most of the products that we sell, and we have not always identified secondary suppliers for food products manufactured in our plants, or secondary suppliers with\nsufficient capacity. A prolonged inability to provide products to fill orders in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on both our Bob Evans Restaurants and the BEF Foods segments\u2019 businesses and our results of operations. Our BEF Foods segment\u2019s business also relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales. Our inability to maintain strong relationships with our key customers and meet their requests could result in a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our BEF Foods business and our results of operations.\nB. FINANCIAL\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting either in volatility or a decline in the price of our securities.\nOur business is not static; it changes periodically as a result of many factors, including those discussed above and:\n\u2022increases and decreases in average weekly sales, restaurant and retail sales and restaurant profitability;\n\u2022changes in advertising and promotional activities and expansion into new markets; and\n\u2022impairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures.\nOur quarterly operating results and restaurant and retail sales may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and restaurant and retail sales for any particular future period may decrease. Our Bob Evans Restaurants and our BEF Foods business segments are also subject to seasonal fluctuations. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results, same-store sales and comparable food products sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any fiscal year. If our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to the factors discussed above, this could result in the price of our securities fluctuating dramatically over time or could decrease generally.\nOur capital structure contains substantial indebtedness, and we have material agreements, which may decrease our flexibility, increase our borrowing and other costs and adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow. In addition, we cannot provide any guaranty of future cash dividend payments or that we will be able to actively repurchase our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program.\nOur consolidated indebtedness and our leverage ratio may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our Credit Agreement, as well as in our sale leaseback transaction agreements and in the mortgage on our corporate support center. A default under one or all of these agreements may significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing. For example, the lenders\u2019 ongoing obligation to extend credit under the Credit Agreement is dependent upon our compliance with these covenants and restrictions. At April 29, 2016, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments under material agreements, as well as principal and interest payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness, will depend on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness when necessary or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.\nIn recent years, we have increased the quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and our Board of Directors\u2019 conclusion that the declaration of cash dividends is in the best interest of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to actively repurchase our common stock and we may discontinue plans to repurchase common stock at any time.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that\nwe would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur current insurance programs expose us to unexpected costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage is structured to include deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability, stop loss limits and similar provisions that we believe prudent based on our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure or where the risk is considered low, such as losses due to acts of terrorism and some natural disasters, including floods. If we incur such losses, our business could suffer. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, including unexpected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs.\nOur actual operating and financial results in any given period may differ from guidance we provide to the public, including our most recent public guidance.\nFrom time to time, in press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls and other contexts, we have provided guidance to the public regarding current business conditions and our expectations for our future financial results. We expect that we will provide guidance periodically in the future. Our guidance is based upon a number of assumptions, expectations and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In providing our guidance, we also make various assumptions with respect to our future business decisions, some of which will change. Our actual financial results, therefore, may vary from our guidance due to our inability to meet the assumptions upon which our guidance is based and the impact on our business of the various risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors and in our public filings with the SEC. Variances between our actual results and our guidance may be material. To the extent that our actual financial results do not meet or exceed our guidance, the trading prices of our securities may be materially adversely affected, and we would suffer associated costs related to the matter, such as legal costs associated with any claims.\nMany factors, including those over which we have no control, affect the trading price of our stock.\nA number of factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock. These include, but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or those of our competitors as compared to analyst expectations; changes in financial estimates by research analysts with respect to us or others in the restaurant or food production industries; announcements of significant transactions (including mergers or acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives) by us or others in the restaurant industry; and actions by activist shareholders. In addition, the equity markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that affect the stock price of companies in ways that have been unrelated to an individual company\u2019s operating performance. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, based on factors specific to our company and industry, as well as factors related to the equity markets overall.\nIn addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our common stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders, as well as non-operating initiatives such as share repurchase programs. Any failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, particularly with respect to comparable restaurant sales, revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nOur dividend program, as well as stock repurchase program (if any), requires the use of a substantial amount of our free cash flow. Assuming the authorization of either by our Board of Directors, our ability to pay dividends over time, or repurchase stock from time to time, will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and capacity to borrow funds, which may be subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay our dividends over time may negatively impact investor confidence in us, and may negatively impact our stock price.\nAs a result of the provisions of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2013, pursuant to which the sale of the Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 restaurant chain was sold, we may not receive all or part of the purchase price evidenced by the $30.0 million promissory note from the buyer.\nAs part of the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2013, pursuant to which we sold the Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 restaurant chain, part of the consideration we received in the transaction was a promissory note, (the \"Note\")\nwhich has a principal balance of $30.0 million, an annual interest rate of 1.5%, a term of seven years and a principal and interest payment date of February, 2020. Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is wholly owned by Le Duff America, Inc. (\u201cLe Duff\u201d), which is a U.S.-based subsidiary of Groupe Le Duff, a global bakery and restaurant company headquartered in France.\nPartial prepayments are required prior to maturity if the buyer reaches certain levels of EBITDA during specified periods. No partial prepayments have been received on this Note as of April 29, 2016. Our right to repayment under the Note is subordinated to third party lenders as well as funding that may be provided by the parent company. In the event of a sale or liquidation of Mimi\u2019s Caf\u00e9 by its parent company, our right to repayment may be subordinated to payments owed to the parent company and potentially reduced based on the funds available for repayment. Because the Note is subordinated under certain conditions, it is possible that the principal amount of the Note may not be paid in full or at all. Full repayment of the Note on its due date is dependent on Mimi\u2019s ability to generate sufficient cash flow up to and at the maturity date of the Note. Refer to Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements for more information.\nC. STRATEGIC\nOur plans depend significantly on our strategic priorities and business initiatives designed to enhance our menu and retail offerings, support our brand, improve operating margins and improve the efficiencies and effectiveness of our operations. Failure to achieve or sustain these plans could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have had, and expect to continue to have, priorities and initiatives in various stages of testing, evaluation and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to improve our results of operations and financial condition. These priorities and initiatives include, but are not limited to, improving the quality of food and food products, re-engineering restaurant, plant and corporate processes to reduce costs and improve margins, applying technology to improve the guest experience and operational reporting, evolving our marketing messaging to support the brand across the restaurant and food products segments, the introduction of new as well as tiered menu pricing, increasing same store sales as well as expanding the markets served by our food products. It is possible that our focus on these priorities and initiatives and constantly changing consumer preferences could cause unintended changes to our current results of operations. Additionally, many of these initiatives contain risks in their application to our business in general, even when tested successfully on a more limited scale. It is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur long-term growth strategy depends on successfully executing our current strategic efforts to turnaround our restaurant business and results. Our ability to complete our turnaround efforts is influenced by factors beyond our control, which may impact our turnaround efforts and impair our long-term growth.\nWe are pursuing a disciplined strategy which depends in large part on our ability to execute our current restaurant turnaround efforts that are focused on improving food quality, consistency of execution and improving hospitality to deliver a highly satisfied guest experience on each visit. If we are unable to execute the turnaround efforts, our long-term opportunities could be impaired. As part of our long term strategy we have completed certain strategic transactions, including the mortgage of our New Albany, Ohio corporate support center, and the sale leaseback of our BEF Foods manufacturing facilities in Lima, Ohio, and Sulphur Springs, Texas, and of 143 of our Bob Evans Restaurant locations. There is no guarantee that these transactions, or others in the future, will have a positive impact on our long-term strategy or results of operations.\nThe loss of key executives or difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our future growth and success.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in the restaurant, retail and food products industries. Our future growth and success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel, and we design our compensation programs to attract and retain key personnel and facilitate our ability to develop effective succession plans. If we fail to retain senior management or other key personnel or to attract key personnel, our succession planning and operations could be materially and adversely affected. We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality restaurant employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our business goals.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant and food products industries are highly competitive and are affected by changes in the public\u2019s eating habits and preferences, population trends, traffic patterns and weather conditions, as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits, many of which are beyond our control. Key competitive factors include the\nquality and value of the items offered, food preparation and consistency of the product preparation, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, advertising, name brand awareness and image and restaurant locations. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional or local companies, and some have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have, which may give them competitive advantages. We compete with many restaurant and food product operators and other retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees. We also face competition as a result of the convergence of grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry. We expect competition to intensify as our competitors expand operations in our markets and quick-service restaurant chains expand their breakfast offerings, as well as the introduction, marketing and distribution of refrigerated side dishes. This increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations\nOur failure to turn-around our restaurant segment and generate growth in customer traffic or transaction for an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSame-store sales and average unit volumes are key measures of the financial health of our company, as well as our individual restaurants. A number of factors, including the following, may affect same-store sales growth:\n\u2022local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits;\n\u2022customer trends;\n\u2022customer traffic increases or decreases;\n\u2022intense competition in the restaurant business;\n\u2022menu mix and pricing shifts\n\u2022customer satisfaction;\n\u2022extraordinary events such as weather or natural disasters; and\n\u2022pricing pressure.\nIf we are unable to maintain or grow same-store sales, and our costs increase, or if same-store sales decrease and costs remain flat or increase, the effect, over time, is to spread costs across a lower level of sales, or seek to identify additional cost reductions, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur marketing and branding strategies may not be successful, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur marketing and branding strategies continue to evolve to maximize our appeal to customers and compete effectively. We do not have any assurance that our marketing strategies will be successful. If our current strategy to aggressively reduce discounting, use of new advertising, modification of our branding, and other marketing programs, are not successful, we may not generate the level of restaurant and food products sales we expect and the expenses associated with these programs will negatively affect our financial results. Moreover, many of our competitors have successfully used national marketing strategies, including network, cable television, and social media, advertising in the past, and we may not be able to successfully compete against those established and newly developed programs.\nThe growth of our BEF Foods segment\u2019s sales and profits is dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nThe successful growth of our BEF Foods segment depends in part on our ability to add new retail customers, expand our existing production capabilities (including but not limited to our expansion of the Lima, Ohio facility), as well as expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers. This would include expanding the number of our items they offer for sale and product placement within the refrigerated meat and side dish departments. The expansion of the BEF Foods business segment depends on our ability to obtain and retain large-account customers, such as grocery store chains and warehouse customers. Our failure to retain and obtain new large-account customers or maintain our relationships with existing large-account customers could have a material adverse effect on the BEF Foods segments\u2019 business and results of operations.\nOur inability to improve our informational systems in fiscal 2017 to provide increased operational capabilities, to complete the implementation of our core enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d), and for greater access for customers, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOperational excellence and the continued improvement of our customer experience are among our highest priorities. During fiscal 2015 and 2016 we made investments, and will continue to make investments in 2017, as we continue to complete\nthe implementation of a new ERP system and restaurant technology platform (including point of sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) processing), as part of our overall technology infrastructure, as well as training the employees necessary to support it. These improvements are designed to more effectively collect and process our enterprise information and data for resource planning. They will also improve the way in which our customers interact with us, including through the ordering process, food production and finally through the delivery of food to the customer. Our inability to effectively implement our core ERP and POS systems' replacement, as well as the other changes to our technology infrastructure, could negatively impact our operations and processes and could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nA material disruption in our information technology, network infrastructure and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology across our operations, including, but not limited to, our in-restaurant and enterprise-wide computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations. These include POS processing, supply chain management, retail merchandise allocation and distribution, labor productivity, plant management and expense management, among others. As an example, the POS system we are implementing, and back-office systems, provide information regarding daily sales, cash receipts, inventory, food and beverage costs, labor costs and other controllable operating expenses. Our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems to process these transactions, summarize results, manage and report on our business and our supply chain. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, network, cable system, Internet and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology and telecommunication systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our information technology and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nEvents out of our control may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our businesses, and their revenues and results of operations.\nWe are a highly automated business and rely on our production facilities, our network infrastructure, the Internet, our website and mobile apps for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales (including online ordering) activities. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause systems loss or interruptions, cessation or limitations on operations and services, disruption in our product production, breaches of data security and loss of critical data.\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and foods segments operations are centralized at one Ohio location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of digital and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, experience delays in required reporting and compliance, fail to adequately support field operations and experience other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures. These could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nOur BEF Foods segment operates four manufacturing plants. If we had to close or delay production of all or part of the operations at one or more of these plants for an extended period of time, we would likely be unable to increase production at our other plants or with our third-party co-packers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot guarantee that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions or other brand extensions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may discourage potential acquirers of the Company.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, certain provisions of Delaware law could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. This includes Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (as defined in the statute) for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our current directors and executive officers a substantial ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company. These provisions would apply even if an acquisition, or other significant corporate transaction, was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders. If a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our securities could decline.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nIn 2014 Castlerigg Global Equity Special Event Master Fund, Ltd., one of our stockholders affiliated with the Sandell Asset Management Corp. (together with its affiliates, \"Sandell Group\"), conducted a proxy contest with us and elected four individuals to our board of directors at our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders. The Sandell Group has continued to contact the Company and release public statements regarding the Company and its\u2019 strategic decisions, as well as indicating it might seek further board representation. While the Sandell Group and its affiliates have not nominated director candidates for election at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the actions of the Sandell Group and its affiliates or another activist shareholder in the future could adversely affect our business because:\n\u2022responding to public proposals and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our management and employees;\n\u2022perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022pursuit of an activist shareholder\u2019s agenda may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our shareholders.\nD. COMPLIANCE\nWe are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including the areas of food processing, health care reform, employment including minimum wage, and environmental matters, and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins.\nThe restaurant and food industries are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to those relating to food processing and safety, minimum wage and other labor issues including unionization, health care, menu labeling and building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food as well as certain retail products.\nOur plant operations, and our food products which are manufactured in third-party facilities, are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (the \u201cUSDA\u201d), the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), and by other federal, state, and local authorities. These regulations relate to the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that we manufacture, produce and process.\nThe Federal Trade Commission and other authorities regulate how we market and advertise our products. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. We also face risks from new and changing laws and regulations relating to gift cards, nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling.\nThe development and operation of our restaurants and plants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.\nWe are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and applicable requirements concerning minimum wage, overtime, health care coverage, family leave, medical privacy, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status). As well as federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition, we are\nsubject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nIncreases in the federal minimum wage, including recent proposals to increase the federal minimum wage and index future increases to inflation, or other changes in these laws could increase our labor costs. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and customers. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards and tracking costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nIn March 2010, the PPACA was enacted and, in June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law except for certain parts related to the expansion of Medicaid. Although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the law will have on us, such changes could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The law requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with this provision of the law, but cannot anticipate the changes in guest behavior that could result from the implementation of this provision, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Also, the failure to obtain and maintain required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations could negatively impact our operations and competitive position, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nPPACA requires restaurant operators with twenty or more locations to make certain nutritional information available to customers. The nutritional disclosure requirements under PPACA are intended to preempt a patchwork of state and local laws regarding nutritional content disclosures that became prevalent over the past several years. Establishments covered by the nutritional disclosure requirements under PPACA have until December 1, 2016 to comply with the new rules. Until the new rules are implemented and enforced, uncertainty with respect to certain details of the new rules and how they will be enforced will continue. Additionally, until the new rules take effect in December 2016, many states, counties and cities are expected to continue to enforce their own nutritional content disclosure requirements. The continued uncertainty relating to nutritional content disclosure and ongoing need to comply with a patchwork of various state and local disclosure requirements continues to be a challenge for us, raising our compliance cost and exposing us to risk of non-compliance. Also, since our menus are printed on a periodic basis, the timing of implementation of new requirements can affect our ability to timely and accurately comply with such legislation, especially when it is subject to continuous changes in interpretation and delays in implementation.\nSome states and local governments also have enacted legislation regulating or prohibiting the sales or disclosure of certain types and/or levels of ingredients in food served in restaurants, such as trans fats, sodium, GMOs and gluten, and are considering taxing and/or otherwise regulating high fat, high sugar and high sodium foods. The success of our restaurant and food operations depends, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings and food product selections to changes in governmental requirements. If consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items. Our inability to respond with appropriate changes to our menu and food products offerings in response to regulations governing the sale or disclosure of certain ingredients could result in us being unable to sell certain products or menu items in certain jurisdictions. It could also lead to negative publicity about our products or menu items, which, in turn, could materially affect customer demand for our concepts and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nA privacy breach could adversely affect our business.\nThe protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, consumer credit, and fraud. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Our ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for on-line gift card orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council (\u201cPCI\u201d). These standards require certain levels of cyber environment security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit card and other personal\ninformation. We continue to evaluate additional security enhancements and have implemented point-to-point encryption for our credit card transactions in our restaurants and end-to-end encryption and tokenization for our on-line credit card transactions. We employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our cyber environment to reduce the likelihood of any security incident. We have developed a multi-disciplined security incident response plan to help ensure that our executives are fully and accurately informed and managing, with the help of content experts, the discovery, investigation, auditing and recovery stages of any security incidents. However, we can provide no assurance that our security measures will be successful in the event of an attempted or actual security incident. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes.\nIn addition, customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this confidential information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations regarding privacy and security or experience a security breach, we could be exposed to risks of data loss, fines, a loss of the ability to process credit and debit card payments, litigation and serious disruption of our operations. Additionally, any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we are the subject of increased litigation regarding personal injuries suffered on our premises, discrimination, harassment or other labor matters.\nEmployee and customer claims against us based on, among other things, personal injury, discrimination, harassment, wage and hour disputes or wrongful termination may divert our financial and management resources from operating our businesses. Restaurant companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging, among other things, violation of federal and state law. Like many employers, we have been faced with allegations of purported class-wide labor violations, and we have taken charges related to the settlement of these cases. An unfavorable verdict or a significant settlement in a future class-action lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nLabor organizing could harm our operations and competitive position in the restaurant industry, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur staff members and others may attempt to unionize our workforce, establish boycotts or picket lines or interrupt our supply chains which could limit our ability to manage our workforce effectively and cause disruptions to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. A loss of our ability to effectively manage our workforce and the compensation and benefits we offer to our employees could significantly increase our labor costs, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 18570, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "BOBE"}
