{"cik": "1431959", "company": "META MATERIALS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following factors could materially affect META\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.\nRisks That Could Affect the Company\u2019s Financial Condition\nLimited Operating History\nThe Company has a limited operating history, which can make it difficult for investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s operations and prospects and may increase the risks associated with investment in the Company.\nThe Company has incurred recurring consolidated net losses since its inception and expects its operating costs to continue to increase in future periods as it expends substantial financial and other resources on, among other things, business and headcount expansion in operations, sales and marketing, research and development, and administration as a public company. These expenditures may not result in additional revenues or the growth of the Company's business. If the Company fails to grow revenues or to achieve profitability while its operating costs increase, its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects will be materially, adversely affected.\nThe Company is expected to be subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises for the foreseeable future, including challenges related to laws, regulations, licensing, integrating and retaining qualified employees; making effective use of limited resources; achieving market acceptance of existing and future products; competing against companies with greater financial and technical resources; acquiring and retaining customers; and developing new solutions; and challenges relating to identified material weaknesses in internal control.\nAccess to Capital\nThe Company believes that current working capital will be sufficient to continue its business for at least the next twelve months. Should the Company's costs and expenses prove to be greater than it currently anticipates, or should it change its current business plan in a manner that will increase or accelerate its anticipated costs and expenses, such as through the acquisition of new products, the depletion of its working capital could be accelerated. The Company presently has access to approximately one hundred and twelve million dollars of new funding through its existing At the Market S-3 Shelf Registration (ATM). The Company believes that this funding is sufficient to enable it to fund its current working capital needs well into 2024.\nThe Company may pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing, or other means. The Company may not be successful in identifying suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and it may not obtain the capital it requires by other means.\nThe Company's ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets and its limited operating history.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership percentage of the Company's stockholders. Raising any such capital could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of its equity securities because its assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. The terms of securities the Company issues in future capital transactions may be more favorable to its new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of other derivative securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have a further dilutive effect.\nThe Company may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. The Company may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities it may issue, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nCurrency Fluctuations\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, EURO, and Great British Pounds, and therefore are exposed to significant currency exchange fluctuations. Recent events in the global financial markets have been coupled with increased volatility in the currency markets. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Great British Pounds may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results. The Company may, in the future, establish a program to hedge a portion of its foreign currency exposure with the objective of minimizing the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange movements. With appropriate risk management and oversight this may be able to offset future risk, however a hedging strategy will result in additional operating costs.\nCosts of Maintaining a Public Listing\nAs a publicly traded company, there are costs associated with legal, accounting, and other expenses related to regulatory compliance. Securities legislation and the rules and policies of the NASDAQ require listed companies to, among other things, adopt corporate governance and related practices, and to continuously prepare and disclose material information, all of which add to a company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs. The Company may also elect to devote greater resources than it otherwise would have on communication and other activities typically considered important by publicly traded companies.\nRisks That Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business\nCustomer Concentration\nThe Company relies on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had 3 customers that accounted for $3,307,914 or 81% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had 3 customers that accounted for $807,912 or 72% of total revenue.\nThe Company currently derives a significant portion of its revenue from contract services between its wholly-owned subsidiary, Nanotech, and a G10 central bank. The Company is developing a new security feature under a framework contract with this customer. There can be no assurance that this project will be successful, or that will result in long-term production revenue for this security feature.\nRisk of not developing new products, applications, and end markets for the Company's products\nThe Company's future success will depend in part on its ability to generate sales of its products as well as generating development revenue. Current and potential customers may have substantial investment in, and know-how related to the Company's technologies. Customers may be reluctant to change from incumbent suppliers or cease using their own solutions, or the Company's products may miss the design and procurement cycles of its customers. Many target markets have historically been slow to adopt new technologies. These markets often require long testing and qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes before admitting new suppliers or adopting new technologies.\nIntroduction of new products and product enhancements will require that the Company effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and coordinate efforts with those suppliers to achieve increased production volume rapidly. If we are unable to implement this strategy to develop new applications and end markets for products or develop new products, the business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any newly developed or enhanced products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products by other companies.\nResearch and Market Development\nAlthough the Company, itself and through its investments, is committed to researching and developing new markets and products and improving existing products, there can be no assurances that such research and market development activities will prove profitable or that the resulting markets and/or products, if any, will be commercially viable or successfully produced and marketed. A failure in the demand for products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the companies in which the Company has or will invest in, and consequently, on the Company.\nRaw Material Source\nThe Company purchases its holographic raw materials from a tier 1 German manufacturer, which is a single source supplier. Disruption in supply from this supplier for any number of factors may cause a material adverse effect on Holography-related products.\nChange in Laws, Regulations and Guidelines\nThe current and proposed operations of the Company are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines relating to production, the conduct of operations, transportation, storage, health and safety, medical device regulation and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require the Company to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of the Company\u2019s business plan and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of its planned operations.\nThe Company launched a new product metaAIR\u00ae in March 2019 to provide laser glare protection to pilots in the airline industry. Currently, metaAIR\u00ae is not subject to any Federal Aviation Administration regulations, however, metaAIR\u00ae may become subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities as the metaAIR\u00ae market evolves further.\nIntegrating Past or Future Acquisitions\nThe Company has completed a number of acquisitions during its operating history. The Company has spent and may continue to spend significant resources identifying and pursuing future acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks including: (1) difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies; (2) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any prior and future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired companies could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities, acquisition or divestiture-related write-offs or the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities.\nRegulatory Approval\nThe Company\u2019s wireless sensing technology to enhance MRI and non-invasive glucoWISE\u00ae monitoring is under development. The Company has performed many experiments on animals and humans, and will continue to perform additional experiments as needed to continue the development of the related products.\nThese products have not yet completed clinical trials/regulatory approval processes, and there can be no assurance that trials will be successful, or that approvals will be granted.\nInsurance Coverage\nThe Company will require insurance coverage for a number of risks. Although management of the Company believes that the events and amounts of liability covered by its insurance policies will be reasonable, taking into account the risks relevant to its business, and the fact that agreements with users contain limitations of liability, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be available or sufficient to cover claims to which the Company may become subject. If insurance coverage is unavailable or insufficient to cover any such claims, the Company\u2019s financial resources, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nPrivacy and Data Security Concerns\nPersonal privacy, information security and data protection are significant issues worldwide. The regulatory framework governing the collection, use, and other processing of personal data and other information is rapidly evolving. The United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use and dissemination of data.\nThe costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations, standards and other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security may be substantial, and they may require the Company to modify its data processing practices and policies. Any actual or alleged noncompliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards, and other actual or asserted obligations may lead to claims and proceedings by governmental actors and private parties, and significant fines, penalties or liabilities.\nRisk of Inability to Protect our Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property Rights\nThe Company relies on a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information to protect the Company's technologies, products, product development and manufacturing activities from unauthorized use by third parties. The Company's patents do not cover all of its technologies, systems, products and product components and its competitors or others may design around its patented technologies. The Company cannot guarantee that it has entered into appropriate agreements with all parties that have had access to its trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information to adequately protect all such information. The Company also cannot assure shareholders that those agreements will provide meaningful protection for its trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. The Company's trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information could be obtained by third parties as a result of breaches of its physical or electronic security systems or its suppliers, employees or consultants could assert rights to its intellectual property.\nRisk that Industry Targets will not Adopt the Company\u2019s Products\nHolography Market-Aviation Industry\nThe Company launched its first product, a laser glare protection eyewear, named metaAIR\u00ae, in March 2019, with a primary focus on the aviation market. The product offers unique performance and benefits over the competition and is the only industry-approved solution to date. The Company has co-developed this product with Airbus through a strategic partnership. Airbus further extended its support by introducing the Company to Satair, an Airbus-owned company, which became the global distribution partner for metaAIR\u00ae to the aviation market. Since 2016, Airbus and Satair have invested a total of $2,000,000 for the product development and exclusive distribution rights to metaAIR\u00ae. Since the launch of metaAIR\u00ae in March 2019, the Company has sold fifty units to its distributor Satair. The Company is currently in the process of increasing its marketing and sales capacity.\nDespite the Company\u2019s close collaboration with the Airbus Group, with the impact of COVID-19 there can be no assurance that the aviation market will accept the metaAIR\u00ae product at the expected market penetration rates and a slower than forecasted market acceptance may have a material adverse effect on Holography laser glare protection related products and the Company\u2019s financial position. The Company is pursuing ancillary markets outside of the aviation industry for its metaAIR\u00ae laser protection eyewear such as in law enforcement and defense.\nLithography Product and Market-Automotive\nLithography related products have not yet reached required manufacturing maturity. The first pilot scale roll-to-roll line is expected to be ready for low volume production during the second half of fiscal year 2022. Broader sales and production are expected to be launched in two to three years\u2019 time after successful completion of automotive product qualification and product introductions. META believes that the automotive market is a strategic high growth opportunity, however despite the Company\u2019s close collaboration with automotive partners, there can be no assurance that the automotive market will accept the NANOWEB\u00ae product at the expected market penetration rates and a slower than forecasted market acceptance may have a material adverse effect on Lithography de-icing/de-fogging, transparent antenna and other related products and the Company\u2019s financial position.\nRisks Related to Facilities and Human Resources\nNew Facility and Permits for Lithography Production\nThe Company is in the process of moving into a larger facility suitable to host the scale-up of production relating to Holography and Lithography. Lithography is a wet chemistry process which requires specific approvals from the local government to allow use of certain chemicals and their disposal.\nAny delay in setting up the facility and receiving permits may impact launch and/or development of related products, and may have a material adverse effect on Lithography and Holography related products and consequently on the Company\u2019s financial position.\nAt present, the facility is expected to be complete during the second half of fiscal 2022.\nRecruiting or Retaining Qualified Personnel.\nThe Company's ability to successfully manage and grow the business and to develop new products depends, in large part, on its ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, particularly highly skilled technical, sales, service, management, and key staff personnel. Competition for qualified resources is intense and other companies may have greater resources available to provide substantial inducements to offer more competitive compensation packages.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and officers are, and may continue to be, involved in other business ventures through their direct and indirect participation in corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, etc. that may become potential competitors of the technologies, products and services the Company intends to provide. Situations may arise in connection with potential acquisitions or opportunities where the other interests of these directors and officers conflict with or diverge from the Company\u2019s interests. In accordance with applicable corporate law, directors who have a material interest in or who are a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with the Company are required, subject to certain exceptions, to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the contract. In addition, the directors and officers are required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the Company\u2019s best interests. However, in conflict of interest situations, the Company\u2019s directors and officers may owe the same duty to another company and will need to balance their competing interests with their duties to the Company. Circumstances (including with respect to future corporate opportunities) may arise that may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to the Company.\nReliance on Management\nThe success of the Company is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion, and good faith of its senior management team. Any loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, or financial condition.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of its intellectual property may have already occurred or may occur in the future. The Company's failure to identify unauthorized use or otherwise adequately protect its intellectual property could jeopardize its competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business. Moreover, any litigation in connection with unauthorized use of its intellectual property could be time consuming, and the Company could be forced to incur significant costs and divert its attention and the efforts of its employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenues and higher expenses, and it may not be successful in enforcing its intellectual property rights.\nRisks Related to Oil and Gas Assets Held for Sale\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividends\nIn connection with the Arrangement, the Company declared a dividend of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to holders of record of its common stock as of June 24, 2021. The Series A Certificate of Designation entitles the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to receive dividends, or Asset Sale Dividends, comprised of the holder\u2019s pro rata portion of the proceeds from the sale of the O&G Assets in the event that the Company consummates one or more such transaction prior to the Sale Expiration Date. However, the Company may not be able to consummate any such transaction prior to such date on terms that will permit itself to pay such dividends, or at all.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive Asset Sale Dividends from any O&G Asset Sale. Prior to declaring or paying any dividend, the Company will deduct from the gross proceeds of an O&G Asset Sale various costs and expenses described in the Series A Certificate of Designation, which include, among others, (i) costs and expenses the Company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale transaction, (ii) costs the Company incurs following the consummation of the Arrangement with respect to the O&G Assets, (iii) taxes the combined company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale, the payment of dividends to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and the O&G Assets, (iv) liabilities the Company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale and (v) amounts paid or payable with respect to outstanding debt, if any. In addition, the Company will also withhold an amount of 10% of the proceeds from each O&G Asset Sale, (\u201cthe Holdback Amount\u201d) to cover potential post-closing liabilities and obligations that the combined company may incur in respect of such transaction. If, after the deduction and withholding of these amounts, there are no net proceeds available for distribution to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, then the Company will not declare or pay a dividend with respect to that transaction unless and until any remaining funds from the Holdback Amount are due to be distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock through a dividend, or the Company receives additional net proceeds from such O&G Asset Sale (for example, as a result of post-closing payments or the release of escrowed funds).\nIn the event that any O&G Assets have not been sold in an O&G Asset Sale that is consummated prior to the Sale Expiration Date, the Company will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, declare a spin-off dividend to distribute beneficial ownership of the remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. However, if the combined company cannot effect such spin-off dividend in a manner that is exempt from registration under all applicable securities laws, the combined company will not declare the spin-off dividend and instead will use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the value of the remaining O&G Assets or to distribute or provide the value of the remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, so long as the Company is not required to divert the attention of management or incur material expenses in excess of amount required to be reserved under the Arrangement Agreement. Thus, the Company, ultimately may not be able to deliver the value of any remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOrogrande and Hazel Projects: Risks and Uncertainties.\nThe Company is in the process of selling or spinning out the O&G Assets. Such dispositions may result in proceeds to Series A preferred shareholders in an amount less than they expect or less than the Company's assessment of the value of the assets. The Company does not know if it will be able to successfully complete such disposition on favorable terms or at all. In addition, the sale of these assets involves risks and uncertainties, including disruption to other parts of its business, potential loss of customers or revenue, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to the Company following any such divestiture.\nFor example, in connection with a disposition, the Company may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, which may result in additional expenses. In addition, in connection with a disposition, the Company may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the business or assets. The Company may also be required to indemnify the purchasers to the extent that its representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to certain potential liabilities. These indemnification obligations may require the Company to pay money to the purchasers as satisfaction of their indemnity claims. It may also take longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of this transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect the Company's business and operating results. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nOil and Gas Operations Liability or Damages\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to the Company from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, the Company may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by itself. In recent years, there has also been increased scrutiny on the environmental risk associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as underground migration and surface spillage or mishandling of fracturing fluids including chemical additives. This technology has evolved and continues to evolve and become more aggressive. The Company believes that new techniques can increase estimated ultimate recovery per well to over 1.0 million barrels of oil equivalent and have increased initial production two or three-fold. The Company believes that recent designs have seen improvement in, among other things, proppant per foot, barrels of water per stage, fracturing stages, and clusters per fracturing stage. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of the Company's properties and/or force it to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. The Company currently has no insurance to cover such losses and liabilities, and even if insurance is obtained, it may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operations. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of the Volume of Reserves\nEstimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially depending, in part, on the assumptions made and may be subject to adjustment either up or down in the future. The Company's actual amounts of production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from the estimates. Oil and gas reserve estimates are necessarily inexact and involve matters of subjective engineering judgment. In addition, any estimates of its future net revenues and the present value thereof are based on assumptions derived in part from historical price and cost information, which may not reflect current and future values, and/or other assumptions made by management that only represent our best estimates. If these estimates of quantities, prices and costs prove inaccurate, The Company may be unsuccessful in expanding our oil and gas reserves base with our acquisitions. Additionally, if declines in and instability of oil and gas prices occur, then write downs in the capitalized costs associated with any oil and gas assets it obtains may be required. Because of the nature of the estimates of the Company's reserves and estimates in general, reductions to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues may not be required in the future, and/or that our estimated reserves may not present and/or commercially extractable. If the Company's reserve estimates are incorrect, it may be forced to write down the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties.\nDecommissioning Costs are Unknown and May be Substantial\nThe Company may become responsible for costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines which it uses for production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d The Company accrues a liability for decommissioning costs associated with its wells but have not established any cash reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our properties or if the Company's estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, the Company may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.\nChallenges to the Properties May Impact the Company's Financial Condition.\nTitle to oil and gas interests is often not capable of conclusive determination without incurring substantial expense. While the Company has made and intends to make appropriate inquiries into the title of properties and other development rights it has acquired and intends to acquire, title defects may exist. In addition, the Company may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for title defects, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. If title defects do exist, it is possible that the Company may lose all or a portion of our right, title and interests in and to the properties to which the title defects relate. If the property rights are reduced, the Company's ability to conduct exploration, development and production activities may be impaired. To mitigate title problems, common industry practice is to obtain a title opinion from a qualified oil and gas attorney prior to the drilling operations of a well.\nContinuing Drilling Obligations Under Leases May Not be Met.\nThe leases for the Orogrande properties include additional drilling requirements for 2022 and 2023. The Company is intending to sell or spin out the leases in 2022 and transfer the ongoing obligations to the new owners of the leases. If such a transfer is not completed in a timely manner in 2022, the Company may be forced to seek an extension from the lessor of the lease drilling obligations or fund the additional activities out of working capital which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company's Ability to Maintain its Rights Under the Leases is Dependent on Numerous Factors Outside of its Control.\nThe leased assets are held for sale. The Company's ability to attract capital to enable on-going compliance with the lease obligations depends upon numerous factors largely beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022oil, NGLs and natural gas prices;\n\u2022global supply and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u2022the overall state of the financial markets, including investor appetite for debt and equity securities issued by oil and natural gas companies and the effects of economic recessions or depressions;\n\u2022the ability to secure and maintain financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022legislative, environmental and regulatory matters;\n\u2022oil and natural gas reservoir quality;\n\u2022the availability of drilling rigs, completions equipment and other facilities and equipment;\n\u2022the ability to access lands;\n\u2022the ability to access water for hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022reliance on vendors, suppliers, contractors and service providers;\n\u2022shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022changes to free trade agreements;\n\u2022inflation and other unexpected cost increases, including with respect to materials and labor;\n\u2022prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022royalty and tax rates;\n\u2022physical impacts from adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022transportation and processing interruptions or constraints, including the availability and proximity of pipeline and processing capacity;\n\u2022technology failures; and accidents\nRisks Related to Legal Matters\nLitigation\nThe Company is currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future, all of which will require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition, and negatively affect the price of its common stock.\nThe Company is, and may in the future become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. For example, the Company currently has securities class action complaints pending against itself, its chief executive officer, and its chief financial officer, asserting that they made false or misleading statements. The complaints seek monetary damages, costs and expenses. For more information, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and \u201cNote 28 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or provide an estimate of potential damages, if any. The Company believes that the claims in the securities class actions are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. Regardless, failure by the Company to obtain a favorable resolution of the claims set forth in the complaints could require it to pay damage awards or otherwise enter into settlement arrangements for which its insurance coverage may be insufficient. Any such damage awards or settlement arrangements in current or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results or financial condition. Even if plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not successful, defending against class action litigation is expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition and negatively affect the price of its common stock. In addition, such lawsuits may make it more difficult for the Company to finance its operations in the future.\nOngoing Government Investigation by the SEC\nIn September 2021, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement, in a matter captioned In the Matter of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. The subpoena requests that the Company produces certain documents and information related to, among other things, the merger involving Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and Metamaterial Inc. The Company is cooperating and intends to continue to cooperate with the SEC\u2019s investigation. Investigations of this nature are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, the SEC Investigation has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. The SEC Investigation could also result in reputational harm to the Company, which, among other things, may limit its ability to obtain new customers and enter into new agreements with its existing customers, or its ability to obtain financing, and have a material adverse effect on its current and future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Financial Reporting\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide timely, reliable and accurate financial reports, identify and proactively correct any deficiencies, material weaknesses or fraud and meet our reporting obligations. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Management identified material weaknesses during fiscal year 2021. Remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure on its financial reporting resources and processes. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate this material weakness in a timely manner, or if any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, the accuracy of our financial reporting and the Company's ability to timely file with the SEC may be adversely impacted. In addition, if the Company's remedial efforts are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal controls occur in the future, the Company could be required to restate our financial statements, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses or deficiencies, subject the Company to regulatory investigations and penalties, harm its reputation, cause a decline in investor confidence or otherwise cause a decline in its stock price.", "PERMNO": 14358, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TRCH"}
