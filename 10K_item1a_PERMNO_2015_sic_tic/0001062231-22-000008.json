{"cik": "1062231", "company": "AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if any of the following risks occur.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the impact of COVID-19.\nOur business and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19. Near the end of March 2020, COVID-19 began to disrupt global economic markets and led to significant reductions in global automotive production volumes. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many governmental and public health agencies in locations in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. As a result, we temporarily suspended production, or experienced a significant reduction in production volumes, in substantially all of our manufacturing facilities at various times during 2020. In 2021, we did not experience significant manufacturing downtime as a direct result of COVID-19.\nThe ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the number of COVID-19 cases reported, vaccine effectiveness, the reimposition of shelter-in-place orders or similar measures and its impact on: consumers and sales of the vehicles we support, and our customers production levels, which are outside of our control. Our supply chain also may be disrupted due to supplier closures or bankruptcies. Our operations may also be impacted by interruptions due to the direct impact of, or precautionary measures associated with, COVID-19 at our locations or those of our customers or suppliers.\nFurther, COVID-19, and its indirect impact on the automotive industry, could exacerbate certain other risk factors below including, but not limited to, dependency on certain customers, dependency on certain global automotive market segments, risks and uncertainties associated with our company\u2019s global operations, dependency on certain key manufacturing facilities, cyclicality in the automotive industry, disruptions in our supply chain and our customers\u2019 supply chain, and our liquidity and compliance with debt covenants.\nOur business has been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by disruptions in our supply chain and our customers' supply chain.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and materials needed for our products. We rely upon, and expect to continue to rely upon, certain suppliers for critical components and materials that are not readily available in sufficient volume from other sources. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. These supply chain characteristics make us susceptible to supply shortages and price increases. If production volumes increase rapidly, there can be no assurance that the suppliers of critical components and materials will be able or willing to meet our future needs on a timely basis. A significant disruption in the supply of components or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur supply chain, as well as our customers' supply chain, is also at risk of unanticipated events such as pandemic or epidemic illness, natural disasters, industrial incidents, changes in governmental regulations and trade agreements, or financial or operational instability of suppliers that could cause a disruption in the supply of critical components to us and our customers. For example, the automotive industry has experienced, and continues to experience, significant disruptions in the supply chain, including a shortage of semiconductor chips used by our customers, increased metal and commodity costs, global logistical constraints, increased transportation costs, higher labor costs and labor shortages. As a result, we have experienced increased volatility in our production schedules, including manufacturing downtime, often with little notice from customers, higher inventory levels and increased labor costs, which have negatively impacted our financial condition. Furthermore, the indirect impact of COVID-19 on existing supply chain constraints, whether caused by or exacerbated by the pandemic, has and may continue to negatively affect our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by volatility in the price or availability of raw materials, utilities, natural resources and transportation.\nWe may experience volatility, whether from inflation or otherwise, in the cost or availability of raw materials used in production, including steel, aluminum and other metallic materials, and resources used in electronic components, or in the cost or availability of utilities and natural resources used in our operations, such as electricity, water and natural gas. We may also experience volatility in the cost or availability of freight and logistics carriers as a result of supply chain constraints. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, or are otherwise unable to mitigate these cost increases, or if we are unable to obtain adequate supply of raw materials, utilities and natural resources, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is significantly dependent on sales to GM, Stellantis and Ford.\nSales to GM were approximately 37% of our consolidated net sales in 2021, 39% in 2020, and 37% in 2019. A reduction in our sales to GM, or a reduction by GM of its production of light truck, SUV or crossover vehicle programs that we support, as a result of market share losses of GM or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSales to Stellantis accounted for approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales in both 2021 and 2020, and 17% in 2019, and sales to Ford accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated net sales in both 2021 and 2020, and 9% in 2019. A reduction in our sales to either Stellantis or Ford or a reduction by Stellantis or Ford of their production of the programs we support, as a result of market share losses or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may also be adversely affected by reduced demand for the product programs we currently support, or anticipate supporting in the future, or if we do not obtain sales orders for successor programs that replace our current product programs, as a result of a shift in vehicle architecture from ICE to electrification, or otherwise.\nOur business is dependent on our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex.\nA high concentration of our global business is supported by our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex (GMC) in Mexico. GMC represents a significant portion of our net sales, profitability and cash flow from operations and we expect GMC to continue to represent a substantial portion of these metrics for the foreseeable future. A significant disruption to our GMC operations, as a result of changes in trade agreements between Mexico and the U.S., tariffs, tax law changes, labor disputes, natural disasters, availability of natural resources or utilities, pandemic or epidemic illness, or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA failure of our information technology (IT) networks and systems, or the impact of a cyber attack, could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes or activities. Additionally, we and certain of our third-party vendors collect and store personal or confidential information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with human resources operations and other aspects of our business. The secure operation of these information technology networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations. We cannot be certain that the security measures we have in place to protect these systems and data will be successful or sufficient to protect our IT systems from current and emerging technology threats and damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed or lost. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, the disruption of our operations or damage to our reputation. In the future, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or repair damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches, or as a result of implementing business continuity processes in response to disruptions or security breaches.\nOur company, our suppliers or our customers and their suppliers may not be able to successfully and efficiently manage the timing and costs of new product program launches.\nCertain of our customers are preparing to launch new product programs for which we will supply newly developed products and related components. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the transition of our manufacturing facilities and resources to support these new product programs or other future product programs on a timely and cost efficient basis. Accordingly, the launch of new product programs may adversely affect production rates or other operational efficiency and profitability measures at our facilities. We may also experience difficulties with the performance of our supply chain, or the supply chains of customers and their suppliers, on program launches, which could result in our inability to meet our contractual obligations to key customers. Production shortfalls or production delays, if any, could result in our failure to effectively manage our manufacturing costs relating to these program launches. In addition, our customers may delay the launch or fail to successfully execute the launch of these new product programs, or any additional future product program for which we will supply products. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted if our customers fail to timely launch such programs or if we are unable to manage the timing requirements and costs of new product program launches.\nOur company may not realize all of the revenue expected from our new and incremental business backlog.\nThe realization of incremental revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the accuracy of customer estimates relating to the number of vehicles to be produced in new and existing product programs and the timing of such production, as well as the fluctuation in exchange rates for programs sourced in currencies other than our reporting currency. Further, as the percentage of our backlog associated with electric vehicle programs increases, these risks could be exacerbated due to uncertainty related to electric vehicles, including end-user acceptance rates. It is also possible that our customers may delay or cancel a product program that has been awarded to us. Our revenues, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected relative to our current financial plans if we do not realize substantially all the revenue from our new and incremental business backlog.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product recall or field action, product liability and warranty claims, litigation and other disputes and claims.\nWe are exposed to warranty, product recall or field action and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected, and we may be required to participate in a recall of such products. We are not responsible for certain warranty claims that may be incurred by our customers, which include returned components for which no defect was found upon inspection, discretionary acts of dealer goodwill, defects related to certain directed buy components, and build-to-print design issues. We review warranty claim activity in detail, and we may have disagreements with our customers as to responsibility for these types of costs incurred by our customers. In addition, as we continue to diversify our customer base, we expect our obligation to share in the cost of providing warranties as part of our agreements with new customers will increase. Costs and expenses associated with warranties, field actions, product recalls and product liability claims could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and may differ materially from the estimated liabilities that we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to warranty claims relating directly to products we produce, potential product recalls for our customers and their other suppliers, and the potential reputational harm that may result from such product recalls, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. Although we believe that none of these matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceeding or any future legal proceedings.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we, our customers, or our suppliers fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nA significant portion of our hourly associates worldwide, as well as the workforces of our customers and suppliers, are members of industrial trade unions employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that future negotiations with labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we, our customers or suppliers will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that such future negotiations will not result in labor cost increases or other terms and conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or our ability to compete for future business.\nWe use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely affect our business and our competitive position.\nOur company's ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel in key positions and functions.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key associates, such as engineers and global operational leadership. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other associates with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products, including those supporting the expansion of our product portfolio into electrification. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key associates, unexpected turnover, or the inability to attract or retain associates, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets are at risk of impairment if our business or market conditions indicate that the carrying value of those assets exceeds their fair value.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) require that companies evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets routinely in order to assess whether any indication of asset impairment exists. Goodwill is required to be evaluated on an annual basis, while finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets should be evaluated only when events and circumstances exist that indicate an asset or group of assets may be impaired.\nWe conduct our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter using a third-party valuation specialist to assist management in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of each reporting unit. These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, market comparables, future cash flows of the reporting units, and appropriate discount and long-term growth rates. A decline in the actual cash flows of our reporting units in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in our valuations, could result in the carrying value of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Further, a change in market comparables, discount rate or long-term growth rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are under continuing pressure from our customers to reduce our prices.\nAnnual price reductions are a common practice in the automotive industry. Many of our contracts require us to reduce our prices in subsequent years and most of our contracts allow us to adjust prices for engineering changes requested by our customers. If we accommodate a customer's demand for higher annual price reductions and are unable to offset the impact of any such price reductions through continued technology improvements, cost reductions or other productivity initiatives, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business faces substantial competition.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive. Our competitors include the in-house operations of certain vertically integrated OEMs, as well as many other domestic and foreign companies possessing the capability to produce some or all of the products we supply. In addition to traditional competitors in the automotive sector, the trend towards advanced electronic integration and electrification has increased the level of new market entrants, including technology companies. Some of our competitors are affiliated with OEMs and others could have economic advantages as compared to our business, such as patents, existing underutilized capacity and lower wage and benefit costs. Technology, design, quality, delivery and cost are the primary elements of competition in our markets. As a result of these competitive pressures and other industry trends, OEMs and suppliers are developing strategies to reduce costs. These strategies include supply base consolidation, OEM in-sourcing and global sourcing. Further, some traditional automotive industry participants are developing strategic partnerships with technology companies as each party seeks to leverage the existing customer relationships and technical knowledge of the partner, and expedite the development and commercialization of new technology. Our business may be adversely affected by increased competition from suppliers benefiting from OEM affiliate relationships or financial and other resources that we do not possess. Our business may also be adversely affected if we do not sustain our ability to meet customer requirements relative to technology, design, quality, delivery and cost.\nIf we are unable to respond timely to changes in technology and market innovation, we risk not being able to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are impacted, in part, by our competitive advantage in developing, engineering, and manufacturing innovative products. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, successfully develop, engineer, and bring to market new and innovative proprietary products, or successfully respond to evolving business models, including electric vehicle advances, may have a significant impact on our market competitiveness. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage through innovation, or if we do not sustain our ability to meet customer requirements relative to technology, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on certain global automotive market segments.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from products supporting RWD light truck and SUV platforms and AWD crossover vehicle platforms in North America, Europe and Asia. Sales and production levels of these vehicle platforms can be affected by many factors, including changes in consumer demand; product mix shifts favoring other types of light vehicles, such as front-wheel drive based crossover vehicles and passenger cars; fuel prices; vehicle electrification; and government regulations. Reduced demand in the market segments we currently supply could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry.\nOur operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors, such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer preference and confidence. Our business may be adversely affected by an economic decline or fiscal crisis that results in a reduction of automotive production and sales by our customers.\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Indebtedness and the Capital Markets\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and our financial condition and operations may be adversely affected by a violation of financial and other covenants.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and related debt service obligations, which could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the markets in which we operate, and to technological and other changes;\n\u2022reduced access to capital and increasing borrowing costs generally or for any additional indebtedness to finance future operating and capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022lowered credit ratings;\n\u2022reduced funds available for operations, capital expenditures and other activities; and\n\u2022competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities, comprised of our Revolving Credit Facility, as well as our Term Loan A Facility due 2024 and Term Loan B Facility due 2024, and our senior unsecured notes, contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. Some, or with respect to certain covenants, all of these agreements include financial covenants based on leverage and cash interest expense coverage ratios and limitations on Holdings, AAM Inc., and their restricted subsidiaries to make certain investments, declare or pay dividends or distributions on capital stock, redeem or repurchase capital stock and certain debt obligations, incur liens, incur indebtedness, or merge, make certain acquisitions or sales of assets.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also include customary events of default. Obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our senior unsecured notes are required to be guaranteed by most of our U.S. subsidiaries that hold domestic assets. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured on a first priority basis by all or substantially all of the assets of AAM Inc., the assets of Holdings and each guarantor's assets, including a pledge of capital stock of our U.S. subsidiaries that hold domestic assets, including each guarantor, and a portion of the capital stock of the first tier foreign subsidiaries of AAM Inc. and MPG.\nA violation of any of these covenants or agreements could result in a default under these contracts, which could permit the lenders or note holders, as applicable, to accelerate repayment of any borrowings or notes outstanding at that time and levy on the collateral granted in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. A default or acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes may result in defaults under our other debt agreements and may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our subsidiaries' and guarantors' ability to operate their respective businesses and our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility could be limited by our covenant ratios under certain conditions. An increase in the applicable leverage ratio, as a result of decreased earnings or otherwise, could result in reduced access to capital under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is a significant component of our total available liquidity.\nOur business could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the global capital markets.\nOur business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in the global financial markets, including interest rates and currency exchange rates. Failure to respond timely to these fluctuations, or failure to effectively hedge these risks when possible, could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Future business operations and opportunities, including the expansion of our business outside North America, may further increase the risk that cash flows resulting from these global operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates.\nThe interest rates included in the agreements that govern our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain of our derivative financial instruments are based primarily on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In the future, use of LIBOR will be discontinued. Use of alternative interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs and volatility in the markets and interest rates.\nOur company faces substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to certain of our associates and retirees. Our ability to satisfy the funding requirements associated with these obligations will depend on our cash flow from operations and our ability to access credit and the capital markets. The funding requirements of these benefit plans, and the related expense reflected in our financial statements, are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility, including governmental regulation. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits, funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets, mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur company's global operations are subject to risks and uncertainties, including tariffs and trade relations.\nAs U.S. companies continue to expand globally, increased complexity exists due to recent changes to corporate tax codes, potential revisions to international tax law treaties and renegotiated trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. These uncertainties, as well as the potential impacts of these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.\nWe have business and technical offices and manufacturing facilities in multiple countries outside the United States. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the U.S., such as changes in currency exchange rates, tax laws, price and currency exchange controls, tariffs or import restrictions, nationalization, immigration policies, expropriation and other governmental action. Our global operations also may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, natural disasters and significant weather events, disruptions in the global financial markets, or public health crises, such as pandemic or epidemic illness.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by global climate change or an inability to meet the expectations of our stakeholders related to environmental objectives.\nNatural disasters or extreme weather conditions that occur as a result of global climate change could lead us, our customers or suppliers to experience significant disruptions in operations or availability of key components, which could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, various stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, providers of debt and equity capital, regulators and those in the workforce, are increasing their expectations of companies to do their part to combat global climate change and its impact by conducting their operations in an environmentally sustainable manner. We have made public commitments to reduce emissions and conserve resources at our various facilities. A failure to respond to the expectations and initiatives of our stakeholders or achieve the environmental commitments we have made, could result in damage to our reputation and relationships with various stakeholders, as well as adverse impacts to our financial condition due to volatility in the cost or availability of capital, difficultly obtaining new business or entering into new supplier relationships, a possible loss of market share on our current product portfolio, or difficulty attracting and retaining a skilled workforce.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our company's global results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our local functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in current period income. In the future, unfavorable changes in exchange rate relationships between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and their non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. While we use, from time to time, foreign currency derivative contracts to help mitigate certain of these risks and reduce the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates, our efforts to manage these risks may not be successful.\nWe are also subject to currency translation risk as we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. We report the effect of translation for our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Unfavorable changes in the exchange rate relationship between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulations and Taxes\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences, as well as possible changes in foreign and domestic tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere have been recent global proposals brought forward by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) alongside the Group of Twenty (G-20), for tax jurisdictions to evaluate the potential reform of longstanding corporate tax law principles and treaties that could adversely affect multi-national companies. Although the OECD does not enact tax law, proposals like this or others that lead to substantial changes in enacted tax laws and treaties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to examinations of these income tax returns by the relevant tax authorities. Any negative or unexpected outcomes of these examinations and audits, or any resulting litigation, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to costs associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our current and former operations and facilities have been, and are being, operated in compliance, in all material respects, with such laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks in these areas, however, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future by governmental authorities.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nOur restructuring initiatives may not achieve their intended outcomes.\nWe have initiated restructuring actions in recent years to reduce cost and realign certain areas of our business and could initiate further restructuring actions in future periods. There can be no assurance that such restructuring initiatives will successfully achieve the intended outcomes, or that the charges related to such initiatives will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our strategic initiatives, we are actively assessing our product portfolio. As a result, we have divested certain operations and may pursue additional plans to divest certain operations in future periods. Our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we initiate a divestiture and it is not completed in accordance with our expected timeline, or at all, or if we do not realize the expected benefits of the divestiture.\nWe may be unable to consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and joint ventures.\nEngaging in acquisitions and joint ventures involves potential risks, including financial risks, risks related to integrating enterprise resource planning systems, and failure to successfully integrate and fully realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions and joint ventures. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage integrations successfully. As we continue to expand globally and accelerate our diversification efforts, we may pursue strategic growth initiatives, including through acquisitions and joint ventures. An inability to successfully achieve the levels of organic and inorganic growth from our strategic initiatives could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 86547, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "AXL"}
