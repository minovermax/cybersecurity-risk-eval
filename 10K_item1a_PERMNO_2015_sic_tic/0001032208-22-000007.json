{"cik": "1032208", "company": "SEMPRA ENERGY", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating our company and its subsidiaries and any investment in our or their securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC, including documents we file subsequent to this report. We also may be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of these risks occurs, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, and the trading price of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could decline. These risk factors are not prioritized in order of importance or materiality, and they should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report, including the information set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A.\u201d\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA\nOperational and Structural Risks\nSempra\u2019s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments.\nWe are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control, including equity method investments. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments, which in turn depend on their ability to execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, common and preferred dividends (if any) and debt and other obligations. In addition, entities accounted for as equity method investments, which we do not control, and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from doing so by legislation, regulation, court order or contractual restrictions, in times of financial distress or in other circumstances. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra\u2019s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of each entity\u2019s trade and other creditors. In addition, if Sempra is a creditor of any such entity, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the entity\u2019s assets and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by Sempra. Sempra may elect to make capital contributions to its subsidiaries. Unlike a loan, there is no obligation for a subsidiary to repay a capital contribution to its parent, which cannot be accessed by the parent and becomes structurally subordinated to claims by creditors of the applicable subsidiary.\nSempra has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses it does not control or manage or in which it shares control.\nWe have and make investments in businesses we do not control or manage or in which we share control, including as a result of sales of a portion of our ownership interest in some of our businesses. In some cases, we engage in arrangements with or for these businesses that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment, including guarantees, indemnities and loans. For businesses we do not control, we are subject to the decisions of others, which may not always be in our interest and could negatively affect us. In addition, irrespective of whether or not we control these businesses, we could be responsible for liabilities or losses related to the businesses or elect to make capital contributions to these businesses during times of financial distress that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these investments further in Notes 5, 6 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWhen we share control of a business with other owners, any disagreements among the owners about strategy, financial, operational, transactional or other important matters could hinder the business from moving forward with key initiatives or taking other actions and could negatively affect the relationships among the owners and the efficient functioning of the business. Any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur business could be negatively affected by actions of activist shareholders.\nActivist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or assert influence on our board of directors and management. In taking these steps, activist shareholders could seek to acquire our capital stock, which in high volumes could threaten our ability to use some or all of our NOL carryforwards if it results in our corporation undergoing an \u201cownership change\u201d under applicable tax rules. Responding to activist shareholders could require us to incur legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategies.\nAny perceived uncertainties about our future direction or control, our ability to execute our strategies, or the composition of our board of directors or management team arising from activist shareholder attention or other action could lead to a perception of instability or a change in the direction of our business, which could be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Further, any such actions could cause fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors.\nFinancial and Capital Stock-Related Risks\nAny impairment of our assets or investments could negatively impact us.\nWe could experience a reduction in the fair value of our assets, including our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill, and/or our investments that we account for under the equity method upon the occurrence of many of the risks discussed in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report, including any closure of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility without adequate cost recovery, any inability to operate our existing facilities or develop new projects in Mexico due to proposed changes to existing laws or regulations or other circumstances affecting the energy sector or our assets in that country, and more generally any loss of permits or approvals that requires us to adjust or cease certain operations and any investment in capital projects that do not receive required approvals or are changed, abandoned or otherwise not completed. Any such reduction in the fair value of our assets or investments could result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded. We discuss our impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill and the factors considered in such testing in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe economic interest, voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue.\nAt February 18, 2022, we have 315,653,893 shares of our common stock and 900,000 shares of our non-convertible series C preferred stock outstanding. We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, which may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nDividend requirements associated with our preferred stock subject us to risks.\nAny failure to pay scheduled dividends on our series C preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our preferred stock, our common stock and our debt securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of the preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock. Additionally, the terms of the series C preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to elect two additional members to our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.\nOur common stock is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange and registered with the CNBV, which subjects us to additional regulation and liability in Mexico.\nIn addition to being listed for trading on the NYSE, our common stock is listed for trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange and registered with the CNBV. Such listing and registration subjects us to filing and other requirements in Mexico that could increase costs and increase performance risk of personnel given additional responsibilities. In addition, the CNBV, as the Mexican securities market regulator, has the authority to make inspections of Sempra\u2019s business, primarily in the form of requests for information and documents; impose fines or other penalties on Sempra and its directors and officers for violations of Mexican\nsecurities laws and regulations; and seek criminal liability for certain actions conducted or with effects in Mexico. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO ALL SEMPRA BUSINESSES\nOperational Risks\nOur businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and information systems.\nOur businesses own and operate electric transmission, distribution and storage facilities, natural gas transmission, distribution, regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities and other energy infrastructure, which are, in many cases, interconnected and/or managed by information technology systems. Even though our businesses undertake capital investment projects to construct, replace, maintain, improve and upgrade their respective facilities and information systems, there is a risk of, among other things, potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and systems; human error; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, materials or labor; operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements or governmental interventions; inability to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply contracts; and performance below expected levels, and these risks could be amplified while capital investment projects are in process. Because our transmission facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by these or similar events occurring on the systems of such third parties, some of which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us.\nAdditional risks associated with the ability of our businesses to safely and reliably operate, maintain, improve and upgrade their respective facilities and systems, many of which are beyond our businesses\u2019 control, include:\n\u25aafailure to meet customer demand for electricity and/or natural gas, including electrical blackout, curtailments or gas outages\n\u25aanatural gas surges into homes or other properties\n\u25aathe release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water or soil, including gas leaks\n\u25aainadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events\nThe occurrence of any of these events could affect demand for electricity, natural gas or other forms of energy, cause unplanned outages, damage our businesses\u2019 assets and/or operations, damage the assets and/or operations of third parties on which our businesses rely, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. Any such outcome could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been materially impacting communities, supply chains, economies and markets around the world since March 2020. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, Sempra and some or all its businesses have been and could continue to be impacted by this pandemic or any future pandemic in a number of ways, including:\n\u25aaImplementing protocols and processes to comply with applicable government mandates related to virus exposure, testing and vaccination\n\u25aaConducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations and virtualization of certain business activities, which could result in increased employee turnover or absenteeism, decreased efficiency and productivity and other similar affects that could increase operating costs and jeopardize our ability to satisfy compliance requirements and sustain operations\n\u25aaDisruption in the capital markets, which has affected and could further affect liquidity, strategic initiatives and prospects, including in some cases a slowdown of planned capital spending\n\u25aaCustomer-protection measures implemented by SDG&E and SoCalGas, including suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for all customers (except for SoCalGas\u2019 noncore customers), waiving late payment fees, offering flexible payment plans and automatically enrolling residential and small business customers with past-due balances in long-term repayment plans, which have collectively resulted in a reduction in payments from SDG&E and SoCalGas\u2019 customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts that could become material and may not be fully recoverable\n\u25aaPrecautionary, preemptive and responsive actions taken by our current and prospective counterparties, customers and partners, as well as regulators and other governing bodies that affect our businesses, which have affected and could further affect our operations, results, liquidity and ability to pursue capital projects and strategic initiatives\nAny of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our\nbusiness operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are necessary for the safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers and, generally, the communities we serve. However, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may further impact our businesses.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and other similar events could materially adversely affect us.\nOur facilities and infrastructure, including projects in development and under construction, may be damaged by severe weather, natural disasters, accidents, explosions or acts of terrorism, war or criminality. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable, explosive and radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities for which we could be held responsible, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents pose to a typical business.\nSuch incidents could result in business and project development disruptions, power outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life for which we could be liable and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects, such as fires; leaks of natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane, ethane, other GHG emissions or radioactive material; spills or other damage to natural resources; or other nuisances to affected communities. Any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings and/or increase costs, including maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts associated with claims against us, and regulatory fines, penalties and disallowances. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, which we discuss further below under \u201cRisks Related to Sempra California - Operational Risks.\u201d For our regulated utilities, these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Insurance coverage for these costs may increase or become prohibitively expensive, be disputed by insurers, or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels, and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors. Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to customers. Moreover, weather-related incidents have become more prevalent, unpredictable and severe as a result of climate change or other factors, and we are currently experiencing a global pandemic, any of which could have a greater impact on our businesses than currently anticipated and, for our regulated utilities, rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe seek growth opportunities in the market organically and inorganically, including through the acquisition of, or partnerships in, operating companies.\nWe diligently analyze the financial viability of each acquisition, partnership and JV we pursue. However, our diligence may prove to be insufficient, and there could be difficulties in integrating acquired assets to our standards or in a timely manner or latent unforeseen defects. In addition, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions, partnerships or JVs such as increased earnings, cost savings, or revenue enhancements, for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel, higher and unexpected acquisition and operating costs, unknown liabilities, and fluctuations in markets. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIncreasing activities and projects intended to advance new energy technologies could introduce new risks to our businesses.\nWe may periodically undertake or become involved in research and development projects and other activities designed to develop new technologies in the energy space, including those related to hydrogen, energy storage, carbon sequestration, grid modernization and others. These activities and projects can involve significant employee time, as well as substantial capital resources that may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our non-regulated utility businesses, may not be able to be passed through to customers. In addition, the timing to complete these activities and projects is inherently uncertain and may require significantly more time and funding than we initially anticipate. Moreover, many of these technologies are in the early stage of development, and the applicable activities and projects may not be completed or the applicable technologies may not prove economically and technically feasible. If any of these circumstances occurs, we may not recover or receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources invested in these activities and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.\nSeveral of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, which are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to negotiate and reach an agreement on these labor contracts could result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Any such labor disruption or negotiated wage or benefit increases, whether due to\nunion activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face, we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and energy grid, natural gas pipeline, storage and other infrastructure.\nOur businesses collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, and our operations rely on complex, interconnected networks of generation, transmission, distribution, storage, control, and communication technologies and systems. Our use of business technologies, including deployment of any new technologies, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems, confidential information and energy grid and natural gas infrastructure. In particular, cyber- and other attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructures, as well as the impacts of these attacks on companies and their communities, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency and may further increase in the event of geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, SDG&E and SoCalGas are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information about customers) to support changes to California\u2019s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice, increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or other unauthorized access of sensitive information. Further, the virtualization of many business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic increases cyber risk, and generally there has been an associated increase in targeted cyber-attacks. Moreover, all our businesses operating in California are subject to enhanced state privacy laws, which require companies that collect information about California residents to, among other things, make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices; allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and be liable under a new cause of action for breaches of certain highly sensitive personal information, and other states in which we do business could adopt similar laws.\nAlthough we invest in risk management and information security measures for the protection of our systems and information, these measures could be insufficient or otherwise fail. The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing these protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address increasingly intense and complex cyber risks. We often rely on third-party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain, modify and update our systems, and these third parties may not have adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems. Any cyber-attack, including ransomware attacks, on our or our vendors\u2019 information systems or the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines or our distribution, storage and other infrastructure, or unauthorized access, damage or improper disclosure of confidential information, could result in disruptions to our business operations, regulatory compliance failures, inabilities to produce accurate and timely financial statements, energy delivery failures, financial and reputational loss, customer dissatisfaction, litigation, violation of privacy laws and fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Although Sempra currently maintains cyber liability insurance, this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with any compromise of our information systems or confidential information, and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates we believe are commercially reasonable.\nFinancial Risks\nOur debt service obligations expose us to risks, and with respect to Sempra, could require additional equity securities issuances.\nOur businesses have debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects by, among other things:\n\u25aamaking it more difficult and costly for each of these businesses to service, pay or refinance their debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions\n\u25aalimiting flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to business developments or changes in the industry sectors in which they operate\n\u25aarequiring cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the cash available for other purposes\n\u25aacausing lenders to require materially adverse terms in the instruments for new debt, such as restrictions on uses of proceeds or other assets or limitations on incurring additional debt, creating liens, paying dividends, repurchasing stock, making investments or receiving distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments\nSempra\u2019s goal is to maintain or improve its credit ratings, but it may not be able to do so. To maintain these credit ratings, we may seek to reduce our outstanding indebtedness with the proceeds from issuances of equity securities. We may not be able to complete equity issuances on terms we consider acceptable or at all, and any new equity we do issue may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of existing holders of Sempra\u2019s common and/or preferred stock. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be negatively affected by market and economic conditions and other factors, and any such effects could materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses are capital-intensive. In general, we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and short-term borrowings to fund a significant portion of day-to-day business operations. Sempra may also seek to raise capital by issuing equity or selling equity interests in our subsidiaries or investments.\nLimitations on the availability of credit, increases in interest rates or credit spreads or other negative effects on the terms of any debt or equity financing could cause us to fund operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or fail to raise our targeted amount of funding, which could negatively impact our ability to meet contractual and other commitments, pursue development projects, make non-safety related capital expenditures and sustain operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition to market and economic conditions, factors that can affect the availability and cost of capital include:\n\u25aaadverse changes to laws and regulations, including the recent and proposed changes to the regulation of the energy market in Mexico\n\u25aathe overall health of the energy industry\n\u25aavolatility in electricity or natural gas prices\n\u25aafor Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, risks related to California wildfires\n\u25aafor Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, any deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California\n\u25aacredit ratings downgrades\nWe are subject to risks due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of LIBOR and its scheduled discontinuance.\nCertain of our financial and commercial agreements, including those for variable rate indebtedness, as well as interest rate derivatives, incorporate LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain rates. As directed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, banks ceased making new LIBOR-based issuances at the end of 2021, and publication of certain key U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors for existing loans is expected to cease in mid-2023. These events could cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has performed historically. Use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which has been identified as the replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR, may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made using LIBOR. Changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR, any uncertainty regarding such changes or discontinuance, and the performance and characteristics of alternative benchmark rates, could negatively affect our existing and future variable rate indebtedness and interest rate hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate LIBOR, and could require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements, which may be materially worse than existing terms. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nCredit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook.\nCredit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas and SI Partners and certain of our other businesses and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the factors described below and the ability to generate cash flows; level of indebtedness; overall financial strength; specific transactions or events, such as share repurchases and significant litigation; the status of certain capital projects; and the state of the economy and our industry generally. These credit ratings could be downgraded, or other negative credit rating actions could occur at any time. We discuss these credit ratings further in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nFor Sempra, Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch (collectively, the Rating Agencies) have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaexpansion of natural gas liquefaction projects or other unregulated businesses in a manner inconsistent with its present level of credit quality\n\u25aaSempra\u2019s consolidated financial measures do not improve, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aacatastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E, or catastrophic wildfires caused by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at SDG&E, SoCalGas and/or SI Partners\nFor SDG&E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aacatastrophic wildfires caused by SDG&E or other California electric IOUs\n\u25aaa consistent weakening of SDG&E\u2019s financial metrics or a deterioration in the regulatory environment\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at Sempra\nFor SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaSoCalGas\u2019 financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aaSoCalGas experiences increased business risk, including a deterioration in the regulatory environment, leading to weakening of its stand-alone business risk profile\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at Sempra\nFor SI Partners, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions:\n\u25aaSI Partners\u2019 failure to meet certain financial credit metrics\n\u25aaa deterioration in SI Partners\u2019 business risk profile, including incremental construction risk or adverse changes in the operating environment in Mexico\n\u25aaa ratings downgrade at Sempra\nA downgrade of any of our businesses\u2019 credit ratings or ratings outlooks, as well as the reasons for such downgrades, may materially adversely affect the market prices of our equity and debt securities, the interest rates at which borrowings can be made and debt securities issued, and the various fees on credit facilities. This could make it more costly for the affected businesses to borrow money, issue equity or debt securities and/or raise other types of capital, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and contractual commitments, and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe do not fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices, and for those contract positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as expected.\nWe may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and/or options, among others, to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity to try to reduce our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as expected, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting, which may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts that may not reflect the associated gains or losses of the underlying position being hedged and could result in fluctuations of our results from period to period.\nRisk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses.\nAlthough we have in place risk management and control systems designed to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or function as expected. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits, which are primarily based on historic price movements and which we discuss further in \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d may not protect us from losses if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices. As a result of these and other factors, our risk management procedures and systems may not prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nMarket performance or changes in other assumptions could require unplanned contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits to eligible employees and retirees. The cost of providing these benefits is affected by many factors, including the market value of plan assets and the other factors described in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A decline in the market value of plan assets or an adverse change in any of these other factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations for these plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur businesses require numerous permits, licenses, franchises and other approvals from various governmental agencies, and the failure to obtain or maintain any of them could materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchises, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all or may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended for a variety of reasons. Obtaining or maintaining these approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on our operations. Further, these approvals require compliance by us and may require compliance by our customers, which could result in modification, suspension or rescission and subject us to fines and penalties if these requirements are not complied with. If one or more of these approvals were to be suspended, rescinded or otherwise terminated, including due to expiration or legal or regulatory changes, or modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise undesirable or impossible, we may be required to adjust or temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations, sell the associated assets or remove them from service and/or construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, in which case we may lose some of our rate base or revenue-generating assets, our development projects may be negatively affected and we may incur impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe may invest funds in capital projects prior to receiving all regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining these approvals; if any approval is conditioned on changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or planned operations; if we fail to obtain or maintain these approvals or comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations; if we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any approval or rights to the applicable property; or if management decides not to proceed with a project, we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project. Any such occurrence could cause our costs to materially increase, result in material impairments, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses are facing climate change concerns and have environmental compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nClimate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our businesses in many ways, including increasing the costs we incur in providing our services and the energy we transmit, impacting the demand for and consumption of our services and the energy we transmit (due to changes in both costs and weather patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. Energy customers are also increasingly indicating preferences for carbon-neutral and renewable sources of energy.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, orders, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change. To comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant amounts on environmental monitoring and surveillance, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees, and these amounts could increase as a result of various factors we may not control, including if requirements change, enforcement of requirements increases, permits are not issued, renewed or amended as anticipated, energy demands increase or our mix of energy supplies changes. In addition, we may be responsible for on-site liabilities associated with the environmental and site condition of our projects and properties, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown, which exposes us to risks arising from contamination at our existing and former facilities and off-site waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations. For our regulated utilities, some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject our businesses to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and/or curtailments of our operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIncreasing international, national, regional and state-level environmental concerns and related new or proposed legislation and regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation, such as increased requirements for monitoring and surveillance, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices, emission fees, taxes, penalties or other obligations or restrictions, may have material negative effects on our operations, operating costs, corporate planning and the scope and economics of proposed expansions, infrastructure projects or other capital expenditures. In particular, existing and potential new or amended legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions and climate change may materially restrict our operations, negatively impact demand for our services and/or the energy we transmit, limit development opportunities, force costly or otherwise burdensome changes to our operations or otherwise materially adversely affect us. For example, SB 100 requires each California electric utility, including SDG&E, to procure at least 50% of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026, and 60% by 2030. SB 100 also creates the policy of meeting all of California\u2019s retail\nelectricity supply with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon resources by 2045. The law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling, and requires that the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning. In addition to signing SB 100 into law, the then-Governor of California also signed an executive order establishing a new statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible, and no later than 2045, and achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter. The executive order calls on CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect several major sectors of California\u2019s economy, including transportation, agriculture, development, industrial and others. California has issued new climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal, including two executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.\nMoreover, shifts in investor sentiment regarding fossil fuels is leading some to reduce investment in or divest from the sector completely. Maintaining investor confidence and attracting capital will be dependent on successfully demonstrating our ability to reduce emissions associated with our operations and the energy we transmit, consistent with our aim to have net-zero emissions by 2050. Our ability to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 depends on many factors, some of which we do not control, including supportive energy laws and policies, development and availability of alternative fuels, successful research and development efforts focused on low-carbon technologies that are economically and technically feasible, cooperation from our partners, financing sources and commercial counterparties, and customer participation in conservation and energy efficiency programs. Although we have developed interim targets and various plans designed to support California in reaching its GHG emissions mandates, including SB 100, and our own energy goals, we may not be successful.\nWe will need to continue to make capital expenditures and incur costs to develop and deploy new technologies and modernize grid systems in our efforts to achieve our climate targets and those mandated by applicable authorities, which may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our non-regulated utility businesses, may not be able to be passed through to customers. Even if such costs are recoverable, the resulting rates or other costs to customers may increase to levels that reduce customer demand and growth. SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as any of our other businesses affected by GHG emissions mandates, may also be subject to fines and penalties if mandated renewable energy goals are not met, and all of our businesses could suffer reputational harm if we do not meet or scale back our GHG emissions goals or there are negative views about our environmental practices generally. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous governmental regulations and complex tax and accounting requirements and may be materially adversely affected by these regulations or requirements or any changes to them.\nThe electric power and natural gas industries are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and our businesses are also subject to complex tax and accounting requirements. These regulations and requirements may undergo changes at the federal, state, local and foreign levels, including in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these regulations and requirements, including in the event of changes to them or how they are implemented, interpreted or enforced, could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect how we conduct our business. New tax legislation, regulations or interpretations or changes in tax policies in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate or do business could negatively affect our tax expense and/or tax balances and our businesses generally. Any failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities or operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among SDG&E, SoCalGas and other Sempra businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as \u201caffiliate rules,\u201d and they primarily impact transmission supply, capacity, and marketing activities, including restricting our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to, or trade with, SDG&E and SoCalGas and its ability to effect these transactions with each other. These rules, as well as any changes to these rules or their interpretations or additional more restrictive CPUC or FERC rules related to transactions with affiliates, could materially adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved.\nOur businesses are involved in a number of lawsuits, binding arbitrations and regulatory proceedings. We discuss material pending proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial money, time and employee and management focus on these lawsuits and other proceedings and on related investigations and regulatory matters. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits and other proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing, costs and ranges of costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property\ndamage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, by insurance or in rates from customers. Any of the foregoing could cause reputational damage and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA CALIFORNIA\nOperational Risks\nWildfires in California pose risks to Sempra California (particularly SDG&E) and Sempra.\nPotential for Increased and More Severe Wildfires\nOver the past few years, California has been experiencing some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned) in its history. Frequent and more severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity, stronger winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity and prevalence of wildfires in California, including in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories, and have made these wildfires increasingly difficult to prevent and contain. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable. These wildfires could jeopardize third-party property and SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 electric and natural gas infrastructure and result in temporary power shortages in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 service territories. Certain of California\u2019s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses in the event of fires in these areas for which SDG&E or SoCalGas may be liable. Any such wildfires in SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 territories could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which we discuss further in this risk factor below and above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Operational Risks.\u201d\nThe Wildfire Legislation\nIn July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law, which we discuss in further detail in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Wildfire Legislation\u2019s revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently, we may not be eligible for the Wildfire Legislation\u2019s cap on wildfire-related liability if SDG&E fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the OEIS, and/or the Wildfire Fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by SDG&E or other participating IOUs as a result of fires in their respective service territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra\u2019s and SDG&E\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. PG&E has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire (measured by acres burned) in California history. In addition, the Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including potential business interruption losses, and interest and attorneys\u2019 fees, even if the utility has not been found negligent. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, including if the utility were found negligent, in which case additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. We are unable to predict the impact of the Wildfire Legislation on SDG&E\u2019s ability to recover costs and expenses in the event that SDG&E\u2019s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation. If a major fire is determined to be caused by SDG&E\u2019s equipment, or if a major fire is determined to be caused by another participating IOU, and the Wildfire Fund is depleted as a result, Sempra\u2019s and SDG&E\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nCost Recovery Through Insurance or Rates\nAs a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric IOU-caused wildfires in California, substantial recent losses recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by SDG&E or SoCalGas, particularly SDG&E, has become increasingly difficult and costly. If these conditions continue or worsen, insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be challenged or unsuccessful when we seek recovery of increases in the cost of insurance through the regulatory process. In addition, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur, or it may not be\navailable in sufficient amounts to meet the $1 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. We are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the amount of any uninsured losses. A loss that is not fully insured, is not sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates, such as the CPUC decision denying SDG&E\u2019s recovery of costs related to wildfires in its service territory in 2007, could materially adversely affect Sempra\u2019s and one or both of SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWildfire Mitigation Efforts\nAlthough we spend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfire-related losses, and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. SDG&E is required by applicable California law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the OEIS and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner and fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans. One of our wildfire mitigation and safety tools is to de-energize certain of our facilities when certain weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk. These \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and lawmakers, which could lead to legislation or rulemaking that increases the risk of penalties and liability for damages associated with these events. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, scrutiny by key stakeholders, ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect Sempra\u2019s and SDG&E\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of distributed energy resources, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments.\nElectric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies, and California\u2019s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes. This growth of DERs will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid\u2019s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, enabling California\u2019s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. The growth of the third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG&E\u2019s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. The CPUC is conducting proceedings to evaluate various projects and pilots; implement changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid to prepare for higher penetration of DERs; consider future grid modernization and grid investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs; determine what, if any, compensation would be feasible and appropriate; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California\u2019s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSDG&E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. While SDG&E currently provides such procurement service for most of its customer load, some customers can receive procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG&E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG&E no longer procures energy for this departing load. CCA is only available if a customer\u2019s local jurisdiction (city) offers such a program and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. A number of jurisdictions in SDG&E\u2019s territory, including the City and County of San Diego and 14 other municipalities, have implemented, are implementing or are considering implementing CCA. Based on our current expectations, SDG&E could procure energy for less than half of its current customer load by December 31, 2022. SDG&E\u2019s historical energy procurement may exceed the needs of its bundled customers as customers elect CCA and DA service. Accordingly, the associated costs of the utility\u2019s procured resources could then be borne by SDG&E\u2019s remaining bundled procurement customers. Existing state law requires that customers having CCA and DA procure their electricity must absorb the cost of above-market electricity procurement commitments already made by SDG&E on their behalf, which requirements are designed to equitably share costs among customers served by SDG&E and by CCA and DA. If adequate mechanisms are not implemented to help ensure compliance with this law, if the law changes, or if the law does not function as intended to achieve ratepayer indifference, remaining bundled customers of SDG&E could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA and DA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG&E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nNatural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source.\nCertain California legislators and stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. Reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain U.S. legislators and the current U.S. Administration. Certain California state agencies and city governments have proposed policies or passed ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas in new buildings, appliances and other applications. These policies and ordinances and any other similar regulatory action could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time. The CPUC has initiated an OIR to, among other things, implement a long-term planning strategy to manage the state\u2019s transition away from natural gas-fueled technologies in an effort to meet California\u2019s decarbonization goals. CARB, California\u2019s primary regulator for GHG emissions reduction programs, continues to pursue plans for reducing GHG emissions in line with California\u2019s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand, including more aggressive energy efficiency programs, increased renewable electric generation and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances. A substantial reduction in, or the elimination of, natural gas as an energy source in California could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019, SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, including impairment of some or all of SoCalGas\u2019 and SDG&E\u2019s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or become stranded, without adequate recovery of and on the investments.\nSDG&E may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned.\nSDG&E has a 20% ownership interest in SONGS, which we discuss further in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG&E and each of the other owners of SONGS is responsible for financing its share of the facility\u2019s expenses and capital expenditures, including those related to decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG&E\u2019s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to risks, including:\n\u25aathe potential release of radioactive material\n\u25aathe potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility\n\u25aalimitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility\n\u25aauncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility\nSDG&E maintains the SONGS NDT to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, CPUC approval is required to make withdrawals from the NDT, and CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the CPUC determines the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the SONGS NDT. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas.\nRates and Other Financial Matters\nThe CPUC regulates SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 customer rates, except for SDG&E\u2019s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the FERC, and conditions of service, as well as its sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, long-term resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings. The CPUC also periodically approves SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework, as well as settlements with third parties. The outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various factors, many of which are not in our control, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; any rejection by the CPUC of settlements with third\nparties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of regulators, consumer and other stakeholder groups and customers. These ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SDG&E and SoCalGas make investments under an approved CPUC framework, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC filing or reasonableness review with unclear standards that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs. SDG&E and SoCalGas also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those related to California\u2019s climate goals and policies, and its ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them. Recovery can also be affected by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism in which there can be a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers\u2019 rates and material differences between the forecasted and authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the actual costs incurred. The CPUC may also experience delays in its decisions on recovery or may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 rates and its and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn addition, under the CPUC\u2019s cost of capital framework, SDG&E and SoCalGas are required to file new cost of capital applications every three years. SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 cost of capital are then assessed in the intervening years through the CCM. The CCM, if triggered by changes in key benchmark interest rates, automatically updates SDG&E\u2019s or SoCalGas\u2019, as applicable, authorized rates of return for that year. For the 12-months ended September 30, 2021, SoCalGas did not trigger the CCM, while SDG&E exceeded its benchmark rate, which would trigger the CCM. The CPUC alternatively provides that SDG&E and SoCalGas each has the right to have its cost of capital assessed through an application based on an extraordinary or catastrophic event that materially impacts its cost of capital and affect utilities differently than the market as a whole. If the CPUC finds that the conditions are met to file such an application, the CCM would not apply. SDG&E has filed an application to have its cost of capital for 2022 assessed through a cost of capital proceeding based on the extraordinary events of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than have the CCM applied. The CPUC has established a proceeding to determine if SDG&E\u2019s cost of capital was impacted by an extraordinary event. If the CPUC finds that there was not an extraordinary event, the CCM trigger for SDG&E could materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects of Sempra and SDG&E. If the CPUC finds that there was an extraordinary event, it will then determine whether to suspend the CCM for 2022 and preserve SDG&E\u2019s current authorized cost of capital or hold a second phase of the proceeding to set a new cost of capital for 2022. We further discuss the CCM, including the impact of SDG&E\u2019s trigger of the CCM in the most recent measurement period, in \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms - Sempra California - Cost of Capital Proceedings,\u201d and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG&E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC.\nCPUC Authority Over Operational Matters\nThe CPUC has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, competitive conditions, reliability and planning, affiliate relationships and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. For example, in June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to determine whether SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s organizational culture and governance prioritize safety. Phase 1 of the OII involved a CPUC consultant producing a report that evaluates organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to operations, including record of safety incidents. In January 2022, the CPUC issued a ruling initiating Phase 2 activities and entering the Phase 1 consultant\u2019s report into the record. Consistent with the recommendations of the Phase 1 consultant\u2019s report, the ruling indicates that Phase 2 will focus on constructive, forward-looking actions intended to improve safety outcomes in the future. Many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties, including enforcement programs under which the CPUC staff can issue citations that in some cases can impose substantial fines. The CPUC conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any such matter it deems appropriate, the results of which could lead to citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions required to address any noncompliance that may not be sufficiently funded in customer rates or at all. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on Sempra\u2019s, SDG&E\u2019s and SoCalGas\u2019 results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to SDG&E and SoCalGas in Notes 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInfluence of Other Organizations and Potential Regulatory Changes\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how SDG&E and SoCalGas operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, require them to incur additional expenses or otherwise materially adversely affect their and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups, including California Public Advocates Office, The Utility Reform Network, Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network and the Sierra Club. Any success by any of these groups in directly or indirectly influencing regulatory bodies with authority over our operations could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s, SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak, a substantial portion of which may not be recoverable through insurance.\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. As further described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, numerous lawsuits, investigations and regulatory proceedings have been initiated in response to the Leak, resulting in significant costs.\nCivil Litigation\nAs of February 18, 2022, approximately 390 lawsuits, including approximately 36,000 plaintiffs, two consolidated class action complaints, claims for violations of Proposition 65 and shareholder derivative actions are pending against SoCalGas related to the Leak, some of which have also named Sempra and/or certain officers and directors of SoCalGas and Sempra. Additional litigation, including by public entities, or criminal complaints may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses to it. All pending cases are coordinated before a single court in the LA Superior Court for pretrial management. Most of the lawsuits are the subject of an agreement entered into in September 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by all participating plaintiffs of SoCalGas, Sempra and their respective affiliates from all claims related to the Leak. However, this agreement is subject to various conditions to effectiveness, including a minimum participation rate by the applicable plaintiffs and approvals by the LA Superior Court, which may not be satisfied. If these conditions are not satisfied, then the agreement will not become effective and all lawsuits subject to the agreement will remain pending. If these conditions are satisfied, then SoCalGas will be required to make payments of up to $1.8 billion to the participating plaintiffs. The two class action complaints are the subject of agreements also entered into in September 2021 that would result in dismissal of the claims therein and releases by plaintiffs and class members. One of these agreements requires approvals by the LA Superior Court, which may not be satisfied, in which case the complaint will remain pending. If the settlement is approved, then SoCalGas will be required to pay $40 million to a class of property owners. Sempra elected to make an $800 million equity contribution to SoCalGas in September 2021 and may elect to make additional equity contributions in the future that are intended to maintain SoCalGas\u2019 approved capital structure in connection with the accruals related to these agreements. Such amounts, as well as the costs of defending against or settling or otherwise resolving the remaining pending lawsuits, including any lawsuits filed by plaintiffs or class or putative class members who do not agree to settle under or opt out of the agreements described above, and any compensatory, statutory or punitive damages, restitution, and civil, administrative and criminal fines, penalties and other costs, if awarded or imposed, could materially adversely affect SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these risks further above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Legal and Regulatory Risks\u201d and in this risk factor below under \u201cInsurance and Estimated Costs.\u201d\nGovernmental Investigations, Orders and Additional Regulation\nIn June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII to consider penalties against SoCalGas for the Leak. The first phase will consider, among other things, whether SoCalGas violated applicable laws, CPUC orders or decisions, rules or requirements and whether SoCalGas engaged in unreasonable and/or imprudent practices with respect to its operation and maintenance of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility or its related record-keeping practices. The SED has alleged hundreds of violations in this first phase, asserting that SoCalGas violated California Public Utilities Code Section 451 and failed to cooperate in the investigation and to keep proper records. The second phase will consider whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for the Leak and what damages, fines or other penalties, if any, should be imposed for any violations, unreasonable or imprudent practices, or failure to sufficiently cooperate with the SED as determined by the CPUC in the first phase. In addition, the second phase will determine the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of costs incurred by SoCalGas in connection with the Leak, which could result in little or no recovery of such costs. SoCalGas has engaged in settlement discussions with the SED in connection with this proceeding.\nThis OII and other investigations into the Leak could result in findings of violations of laws, orders, rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties, any of which could involve substantial costs and cause reputational damage. In addition, SoCalGas may incur higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures as a result of these investigations or new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident, or our responses thereto, which may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nNatural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability\nIn February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility\u2019s services if it were eliminated.\nIf the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed, or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, the facility could be impaired, higher than expected operating costs could be incurred and/or additional capital expenditures may be required, any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nInsurance and Estimated Costs\nAt December 31, 2021, SoCalGas estimates certain costs related to the Leak are $3,221 million (the cost estimate), which includes the $1,279 million of costs recovered or probable of recovery from insurance. This cost estimate may increase significantly as more information becomes available. A portion of the cost estimate has been paid, and $1,983 million is accrued as Reserve for Aliso Canyon Costs at December 31, 2021 on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe civil litigation against us related to the Leak seeks compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, restitution, and civil and administrative fines, penalties and other costs. We also could be subject to damages, fines or other penalties as a result of the pending regulatory investigations and other matters related to the Leak. Except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain legal and regulatory matters as described above, the cost estimate does not include litigation, regulatory proceedings or other matters to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs for damages, restitution, civil or administrative fines or penalties, defense, settlement or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred. The cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by Sempra associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate. Further, we are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued. These costs or losses not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe have received insurance payments for many of the categories of costs included in the cost estimate, and we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred. Other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter. We continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. If we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery, if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected, if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts, which could be significant, could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas\u2019 and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nAny failure by the CPUC to adequately reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E and Sempra.\nThe NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation (primarily solar installations) for residential and business customers. Under the current mechanism, NEM customers receive a full retail rate for energy they generate but do not use that is fed to the utility\u2019s power grid, which results in these customers not paying their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, but still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. As more and higher electric-use customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on remaining non-NEM customers, who effectively subsidize the unpaid NEM costs, increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation and further increases rate pressure on remaining non-NEM customers.\nThe current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower use customers. As of December 31, 2021, the CPUC has declined to adopt a fixed charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers. However, it has advised the utilities to renew their requests for a fixed charge at a later date if such proposals include an adequate customer outreach and communications plan. In August 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to further develop a successor to the existing NEM tariff. In December 2021, a proposed decision was issued recommending substantial reform of the NEM program through the establishment of a new Net Billing Tariff that would apply to new net metered customers. The new Net Billing Tariff is intended to provide for the payment by new net metered customers of their proportionate share of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, which, if the proposed decision is adopted, should reduce the cost-shifting burden from new net metered customers to non-NEM customers. The timing of the final decision is uncertain. Depending on the structure and functionality of the Net Billing Tariff, which is uncertain, the risks associated with the existing NEM tariff could continue or increase.\nSDG&E believes the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers is critical to help distribute rates among all customers that rely on the electric transmission and distribution system, including those participating in the NEM program. The absence of a charge independent of consumption volume coupled with the continuing increase of solar installation and other forms of self-generation, as well as the progression of distributed energy resources and energy efficiency initiatives that could also reduce delivered volumes, could adversely impact electricity rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system. Any such impact could subject SDG&E to increased customer dissatisfaction, increased likelihood of noncompliance with CPUC or other safety or operational standards and increased risks attendant to any such noncompliance, as we discuss above, as well as increased costs, including power procurement, operating and capital costs, and potential disallowance of recovery for these costs.\nIf the CPUC fails to adequately reform SDG&E\u2019s rate structure to better achieve reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E\u2019s and Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA TEXAS UTILITIES\nOperational and Structural Risks\nCertain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management, operations and policies of Oncor.\nVarious \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures, governance mechanisms and commitments are in place that create legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand. These measures are designed to enhance Oncor\u2019s separateness from its owners and mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted by a bankruptcy or other adverse financial development affecting its owners. These measures subject us and Oncor to various restrictions, including:\n\u25aaseven members of Oncor\u2019s 13-person board of directors must be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the NYSE in relation to Sempra and its affiliates and any other owners of Oncor, and also must have no material relationship with Sempra or its affiliates or any other owners of Oncor currently or within the previous 10 years; of the six remaining directors, two must be designated by Sempra, two must be designated by Oncor\u2019s minority owner, TTI, and two must be current or former Oncor officers\n\u25aaOncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its independent directors or any of the directors appointed by TTI determines that it is in the best interest of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements\n\u25aaOncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause its debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT\n\u25aaif Oncor\u2019s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody\u2019s), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT\n\u25aathere must be certain \u201cseparateness measures\u201d maintained to reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor from Sempra, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra or Sempra\u2019s affiliates (other than Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries) must be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or stock for any entity other than Oncor\n\u25aaa majority of Oncor\u2019s independent directors and the directors designated by TTI that are present and voting (with at least one required to be present and voting) must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O&M in such budget is more than a 10% increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable\n\u25aaSempra must continue to hold indirectly at least 51% of the ownership interests in Oncor Holdings and Oncor until at least March 9, 2023, unless otherwise authorized by the PUCT\nAs a result of these measures, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate matters. We have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors, which are each controlled by independent directors. Moreover, all directors of Oncor, including the directors we have appointed, have considerable autonomy and have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may in certain cases be contrary to our interests. To the extent the directors approve or Oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interests, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nIndustry-Related Risks\nChanges in the regulation or operation of the electric utility industry and/or the ERCOT market could materially adversely affect Oncor, which could materially adversely affect us.\nOncor operates in the electric utility industry and, as a result, it is subject to many of the same or similar risks as Sempra California as we describe above under \u201cRisks Related to Sempra California.\u201d In particular, the costs and burdens associated with complying with the various legislative and regulatory requirements to which Oncor is subject at the federal, state, and local levels and adjusting Oncor\u2019s business and operations in response to legislative and regulatory developments, including changes in ERCOT, and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance, may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. In addition, Oncor operates in the ERCOT market and, as a result, any economic weakness or reduced electricity demand in ERCOT could materially adversely affect Oncor. Moreover, legislative, regulatory, market or industry activities could adversely impact Oncor\u2019s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings, including temporary measures such as the approximately four-month long moratorium on customer disconnections due to nonpayment that was in place following an extreme winter weather event and resulting power outages in February 2021, other actions taken by governmental authorities, customers or other third parties to address financial challenges following this event or other similar events, legislation affecting the ERCOT market to address issues with its operation during this event or other similar events or to improve grid reliability generally, or the growth of third-party distributed energy resources and other technologies that may increasingly compete with Oncor\u2019s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. If Oncor does not successfully respond to any such changes applicable to it, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFinancial Risks\nOncor\u2019s operations are capital-intensive, and it could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments.\nOncor\u2019s business is capital-intensive, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available in the future. Because our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor, we may elect to make additional capital contributions if Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs. Any such investments could be substantial, would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, and could increase our indebtedness, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH\u2019s 2016 spin-off of Vistra from EFH is deemed to be taxable.\nAs part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra\u2019s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the IRC (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from\nthe IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling.\nIn connection with the signing and closing of the merger of EFH with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra (the Merger), EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra and EFH, now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce and potentially eliminate the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on Sempra\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects and the market value of its common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE\nOperational Risks\nProject development activities may not be successful, projects under construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget, and completed projects may not operate at expected levels, any of which could materially adversely affect us.\nAll Energy Infrastructure Projects\nWe are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects, which subject us to numerous risks. Success in developing such a project is contingent upon, among other things:\n\u25aaour financial condition and cash flows and other factors that impact our ability to invest sufficient funds into the project, including for preliminary matters that may need to be accomplished before we can determine whether the project is feasible or economically attractive\n\u25aaproject assessment and design and our ability to foresee and incorporate new and developing trends and technologies in the energy industry, such as our pursuit of projects and design solutions to help enable our and our customers\u2019 climate goals\n\u25aaour ability to reach a final investment decision or meet other milestones, which may be influenced by external factors outside our control, including the global economy and energy and financial markets, actions by regulators, achieving necessary internal and external approvals, including, as applicable, by all project partners, and many of the other factors described in this risk factor\n\u25aanegotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements, including any renegotiation that may be required in the event of delays in final investment decisions or other failures to meet specified deadlines\n\u25aaprogressing relationships from MOUs or similar arrangements, which are nonbinding and generally do not impose obligations on any of the parties, to execution of definitive agreements and participation in the project\n\u25aaidentification of suitable partners, customers, suppliers and other necessary counterparties, negotiation of satisfactory equity, purchase, sale, supply, transportation and other appropriate commercial agreements, and satisfaction of any conditions to effectiveness of such agreements, including reaching a final investment decision within agreed timelines\n\u25aatimely receipt and maintenance of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations that do not impose material conditions and are otherwise granted under terms we find reasonable\n\u25aaour project partners\u2019, contractors\u2019 and other counterparties\u2019 willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments or fulfill their contractual commitments on a timely basis\n\u25aatimely, satisfactory and on-budget completion of construction, which could be negatively affected by engineering problems, work stoppages, equipment unavailability, contractor performance and a variety of other factors, many of which we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Operational Risks\u201d and elsewhere in this risk factor\n\u25aaimplementation of new or changes to existing laws or regulations that impact our infrastructure or the energy sector generally\n\u25aaobtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project\n\u25aathe absence of hidden defects or inherited environmental liabilities for any project construction\n\u25aafast and cost-effective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting the project\n\u25aageopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine\nAny failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve additional costs and otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully complete the project and force us to impair or write off amounts we have invested in the project. If we are unable to complete a development project, if we experience delays, or if construction, financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions, we may never recover or receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources invested in the project and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe operation of existing facilities and any future projects we are able to complete involves many risks, including the potential for unforeseen design flaws, engineering challenges, equipment failures or the breakdown for other reasons of facilities, equipment or processes; labor disputes; fuel interruption; environmental contamination; and the other operational risks that we discuss above under \u201cRisks Related to All Sempra Businesses - Operational Risks.\u201d Any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle for an extended period of time or our facilities operating below expected levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLNG Export Projects\nIn addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects, we are exposed to additional risks in connection with our LNG export projects, including the ECA LNG Phase 1 project under construction and our potential development of additional LNG export facilities. We discuss our LNG export projects in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Sempra Infrastructure.\u201d Each of these projects faces numerous risks. Our ability to reach a final investment decision for each project and, if such a decision is reached and a project is completed, the overall success of the project are dependent on global energy markets, including natural gas and oil supply, demand and pricing. In general, depressed natural gas and LNG prices in the markets we intend to serve due to shifts in supply or other factors could reduce the pricing and cost advantages of exporting domestically produced natural gas and LNG, which could lead to decreased demand. In addition, global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce demand for natural gas and LNG in some sectors. A reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source globally. Oil prices could also make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects in North America, thus increasing supply and competition for any available LNG demand. Any of these developments could impact competition and prospects for developing LNG export projects and negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational.\nOur proposed projects may face distinct disadvantages relative to some other LNG projects under construction or in development by other project developers, including:\n\u25aaThe proposed expansion of the Cameron LNG JV facility (Phase 2) is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the financing agreements for Phase 1 of the project and requires unanimous consent of all JV partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligations of each partner. We may not be able to satisfy these conditions and requirements, in which case our ability to develop the Phase 2 project would be jeopardized.\n\u25aaOur Port Arthur, Texas project is a greenfield site and therefore is subject to disadvantages relative to brownfield sites, including increased time and costs to develop and construct the project.\n\u25aaThe ECA LNG projects are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could obstruct efforts to find or maintain suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements and hinder or halt construction and, if the projects are completed, operations. We discuss these risks below and under \u201cRisks Related to Sempra Infrastructure - Legal Risks.\u201d In addition, the Mexican regulatory process and overlay of U.S. regulations for natural gas exports to LNG facilities in Mexico are not well developed, which, among other factors, contributed to delays obtaining a necessary permit from the Mexican government and reaching a final investment decision for the ECA LNG Phase 1 project and could cause similar delays or other hurdles in the future and lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements. We have entered into contracts with affiliates and third parties, subject to certain conditions, to supply and transport gas to and across the U.S.-Mexico border to meet the requirements of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project if and when it becomes operational. If affiliates or third parties experience any delays or fail to obtain and maintain necessary permits and arrangements to provide such supply or transportation service or if we fail to maintain adequate gas supply and transportation agreements to support the project fully, it\ncould cause additional costs or delays to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. Finally, although we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility with the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project, we expect construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with ECA Regas Facility operations, making the decision on whether and how to pursue the ECA LNG Phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in this large-scale liquefaction export facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial than continuing to provide regasification services under existing contracts for 100% of the ECA Regas Facility\u2019s capacity through 2028.\nDevelopment of additional trains and liquefaction facilities will depend on the ability of our existing pipeline interconnections to be expanded or the ability to permit and construct new pipeline facilities, each of which may require us to enter into additional pipeline interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines. We and third parties may not be able to successfully develop and construct such new pipeline facilities, or we may not be able to secure such additional pipeline interconnections on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe capital requirements for natural gas liquefaction and LNG export projects that we have decided, or may in the future decide, to proceed with can be significant. In addition, our proposed facilities may not be completed in accordance with estimated timelines or budgets or at all as a result of the above or other factors, and delays, cost overruns or our inability to complete one or more of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe may become involved in various financing arrangements with respect to any of our energy infrastructure projects, such as guarantees, indemnities or loans. These arrangements could expose us to additional risks, including exposure to losses upon the occurrence of certain events related to the development, construction, operation or financing of the applicable projects, that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe are dependent on the equipment provided by third parties to operate Cameron LNG JV\u2019s Phase 1 project and the failure of such equipment may adversely impact our business and performance.\nCameron LNG JV has experienced operating issues with equipment provided by certain third-party vendors, which have caused reductions in operating capacity and the declaration of force majeure events by Cameron LNG JV under its tolling agreements. Certain of Cameron LNG JV\u2019s customers have raised objections regarding these force majeure declarations, and Cameron LNG JV\u2019s customers may raise objections in the future regarding these declarations or other force majeure declarations for similar operating issues. Cameron LNG JV\u2019s customers have rights under their tolling agreements to obtain certain future quantities of excess LNG production in connection with these and certain other force majeure events, and future force majeure events may also lead to the additional accrual of similar rights. The requirement to deliver excess LNG production to these customers in connection with these force majeure events has had, and in the future could have, an adverse impact to Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s and our business and cash flows as Cameron LNG JV loses fees related to the excess production.\nThese and other operational issues arising from equipment or facilities provided by third-party vendors may require us to undertake remediation, repair or equipment replacement activities in the future that could result in reductions or cessations in production from our facilities. Although we are seeking to enforce warranty and other claims against our EPC contractors and other equipment vendors and suppliers, we may face challenges in successfully enforcing these claims against these third parties. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nHydraulic fracturing is subject to political, economic and other uncertainties.\nDomestic and international hydraulic fracturing operations face political and economic risks and uncertainties. Several states have imposed or are considering imposing more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements, and some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions that may restrict or prohibit well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state, local or international laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. The current U.S. Administration may have a negative view of hydraulic fracturing, which could increase the risk of regulation that negatively affects these operations. If additional regulation or permitting requirements are imposed on domestic hydraulic fracturing operations, natural gas prices in North America could rise and the relative pricing advantage in favor of domestic natural gas could decline, which could materially adversely affect demand for LNG exports and our ability to develop commercially viable LNG export facilities beyond Cameron LNG JV Phase 1 and ECA LNG Phase 1 (which are fully contracted). Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFixed-price long-term contracts for services or commodities expose our businesses to inflationary pressures.\nSempra Infrastructure seeks to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of its facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. If these contracts are at fixed prices, their profitability may be negatively affected by inflationary pressures, including increased labor, materials, equipment, commodities and other operational costs, rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates. We may try to mitigate these risks by, among other things, using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating and providing for cost escalation when bidding on projects, contracting for direct pass-through of operating costs and/or entering into hedges. However, these measures may not fully or substantially offset any increases in operating expenses or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and their use could introduce additional risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIncreased competition could materially adversely affect us.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience domestically and internationally and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. In particular, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments recently have been characterized by strong and increasing competition for winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. In addition, our Mexican natural gas distribution business faces increased competition now that its former exclusivity period with respect to its distribution zones has expired and other distributors are legally permitted to build and operate natural gas distribution systems and compete to attract customers in the locations where it operates. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nWe may not be able to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply, sales or capacity agreements.\nThe ECA Regas Facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties, and also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. In addition, Cameron LNG JV has long-term liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements with three counterparties that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of its Phase 1 facility. The long-term nature of these agreements and the small number of customers at each of these facilities exposes us to risks, including increased risk if these counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, increased credit risks, and risks associated with the long-term nature of our relationships with these counterparties. We are currently engaged in a legal dispute with the two third-party capacity customers, Shell Mexico and Gazprom, at the ECA Regas Facility involving breach of contract claims, a constitutional challenge of the CRE\u2019s approval of the general terms and conditions for service at the facility, and proceedings seeking to modify or revoke certain material permits needed by the facility and the proposed ECA LNG projects. We discuss this dispute in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These challenges and proceedings or any similar or other issues that arise with respect to these or our other long-term contracts, including the conflict in Ukraine, could lead to significant legal and other costs, result in cancelation of certain key contracts or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with long-term customers, suppliers or partners, and could negatively impact the reliability of revenues from the applicable projects and the prospects for any implicated development projects. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Infrastructure\u2019s ability to enter into new or replace existing long-term capacity agreements for its natural gas pipeline operations is dependent on, among other factors, demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from its transportation customers, which may include our LNG export facilities. A decrease in demand for or supply of LNG or natural gas from such customers or the occurrence of other events that hinder Sempra Infrastructure from maintaining such agreements or establishing new ones could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nThe electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built, supplies of energy and related products may exceed demand, competitive pressures may increase and wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile. Without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s facilities are capable of producing or sell it at favorable prices, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses depend on the performance of counterparties, and any performance failures by these counterparties could materially adversely affect us.\nOur businesses depend on business partners, customers, suppliers and other counterparties who owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term arrangements to perform their obligations in accordance with such arrangements. Should they fail to perform, we may need to enter into alternative arrangements or honor our underlying commitments at then-\ncurrent market prices, which may result in additional losses to us to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties. Any efforts to enforce the terms of these arrangements through legal or other means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and may not be successful. In addition, many such arrangements, including our relationships with the applicable counterparties, are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. We also may not be able to secure replacement agreements with other partners, customers or suppliers at all or on terms at least as favorable to the original terms if any of these agreements terminate. Further, we often extend credit to customers and other counterparties and, although we perform credit analyses prior to extending credit, we may not be able to collect the amounts owed to us, which presents an increased risk for our long-term supply, sales and capacity contracts. The failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Infrastructure\u2019s obligations and those of its LNG suppliers are contractually subject to suspension or termination for \u201cforce majeure\u201d events, which generally are beyond the control of the parties, and limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages that may prohibit recovery of all costs incurred for any breach of an agreement. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Infrastructure engages in JVs and invests in companies in which other equity partners may have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment. We discuss the risks related to these arrangements above under \u201cRisks Related to Sempra - Operational and Structural Risks.\u201d\nWe rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity.\nWe depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to, among other things:\n\u25aadeliver the natural gas, LNG, electricity and LPG we sell to customers or use for our natural gas liquefaction export facilities\n\u25aasupply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities\n\u25aaprovide retail energy services to customers\nIf transportation is disrupted, if the construction of new or modified interconnecting infrastructure is not completed on schedule or if capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to move forward with our projects on schedule, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to our customers, we may be responsible for damages incurred by these customers, such as the cost of acquiring alternative supplies at then-current spot market rates, and we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace in competitive market conditions. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nFinancial Risks\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency and inflation risks.\nOur operations in Mexico pose foreign currency and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to the Mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue, costs and cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We may attempt to hedge cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not successfully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in \u201cPart II - Item 7. MD&A\u201d and \u201cPart II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nOur businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, that could materially adversely affect us.\nWe buy energy-related commodities from time to time for pipeline operations, LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors, including adverse weather conditions, supply and demand changes, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, commodity production levels and storage\ncapacity, energy and environmental legislation and regulations, and economic and financial market conditions. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal, regulatory, tax, economic, geopolitical and management oversight risks and challenges.\nOverview\nWe own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and we do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. These risks include the following and the other risks discussed in this risk factor below:\n\u25aatax, trade, environmental and other foreign laws and regulations and compliance with them, including legal limitations on ownership in some foreign countries and inadequate or inconsistent enforcement of regulations\n\u25aaactions by local regulatory bodies, including setting rates and tariffs that may be earned by or charged to our businesses\n\u25aaadverse changes in social, political, economic or market conditions or the stability of foreign governments\n\u25aaadverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals; challenges to or difficulty obtaining, maintaining and complying with permits or approvals; difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights; differing legal standards for lawsuits or other proceedings; and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico\n\u25aaexpropriation or theft of assets\n\u25aawith respect to our non-utility international business activities, changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by many of the factors listed above, among others\nMexican Government Influence on Economic and Energy Matters\nThe Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant and increasing influence over the Mexican economy and energy sector and is proposing additional changes that, in each case, could fundamentally impact private investment in this sector.\nWith respect to the electricity market, the Mexican legislature is currently considering proposed constitutional reform that would, among other things, make the CFE the only entity allowed to commercialize electric energy in Mexico, thereby eliminating the wholesale electricity market entirely. This reform would also limit the overall capacity and types of plants eligible to generate electricity for the CFE to commercialize, resulting in the cancelation of electricity generation permits and contracts for the sale of electricity to the CFE, including permits at all of Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s operational power generation facilities. Recent Mexican governmental actions in the electricity market also include resolutions, orders, decrees, regulations and proposed amendments to Mexican law that could, among other things, threaten the prospects for private-party renewable energy generation in the country; limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits; and increase costs of electricity for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders.\nWith respect to midstream and downstream activities, recent governmental actions include amendments in June, October, and November of 2021 to Mexico\u2019s General Foreign Trade Rules that establish additional requirements for obtaining authorizations for the import and export of hydrocarbons, refined products, petrochemicals, and biofuels through channels other than those authorized (LDA authorizations). The ECA Regas Facility and the Veracruz terminal have LDA authorizations that are valid through 2023, although the ability to subsequently renew these authorizations may be limited by these amended rules. We are assessing the effect of these amended rules on our operations and development of future projects, including those in the vicinity of Topolobampo, Manzanillo and Ensenada, as well as the proposed ECA LNG liquefaction projects. In addition, amendments to Mexico\u2019s Hydrocarbons Law that give SENER and the CRE additional powers to suspend and revoke permits were published in May 2021. While the courts have enjoined enforcement of these amendments pending a final disposition in the case of several of our projects, the amendments provide that suspension of permits will be determined by SENER or the CRE when a danger to national security, energy security, or the national economy is foreseen, and also provide new grounds for the revocation of permits under certain circumstances. Additionally, in the case of existing permits, the amendments direct authorities to revoke permits that\nfail to comply with the minimum storage requirements established by SENER or fail to comply with requirements or violate provisions established by the amended Hydrocarbons Law.\nFinally, as part of an industrywide audit and investigative process initiated by the CRE to enforce fuel procurement laws, federal prosecutors conducted inspections at several refined products terminals, including Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s refined products terminal in Puebla, to confirm that the gasoline and/or diesel in storage were legally imported. During the inspection of the Puebla terminal in September 2021, a federal prosecutor took samples from all the train and storage tanks in the terminal and ordered that the facility be temporarily shut down during the pendency of the analysis of the samples and investigation, while leaving the terminal in Sempra Infrastructure\u2019s custody. In addition, in November 2021, the CRE notified Sempra Infrastructure of the commencement of an administrative proceeding for revoking the storage permit at the Puebla terminal due to alleged breach of its terms and conditions. We cannot predict when the investigation will be completed, the outcome of the administrative proceeding or whether and/or when the facility will be able to commence commercial operations.\nWe discuss these Mexican governmental actions further in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict whether proposed changes like the constitutional reform to the electricity market or other similar governmental actions will ultimately be passed or otherwise become effective in their current forms, nor can we predict the nature or level of impact of this constitutional reform on non-electric segments of the energy sector. We also cannot predict whether actions to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn existing laws and other governmental actions will be successful. More generally, we cannot predict the impact that the political, social, and judicial landscape in Mexico will have on that country\u2019s economy and energy sector and our business in Mexico. If any of the recent Mexican governmental actions are passed or otherwise become effective, if efforts to enjoin their enforcement or suspend or overturn them fail, or if other similar moves by the Mexican government are taken to curb private-party participation in the energy sector, including the passage of additional laws or regulations or increased investigative and enforcement activities, this could materially impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nU.S. and Mexican Laws and Foreign Policy, including Trade and Related Matters\nOur international business activities are subject to U.S. and Mexican laws and regulations related to foreign operations or doing business internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley Federal Anticorrupci\u00f3n en Contrataciones P\u00fablicas) and similar laws, and are sensitive to U.S. and Mexican foreign policy, trade policy and other geopolitical factors. The current and the last U.S. Administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements, tariffs, immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations. Shifts in foreign policy could increase the adverse effects on our businesses and create uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the impact these policies could have on our businesses. Violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above, as well as foreign policy positions that adversely affect imports and exports between the U.S., Mexican and other economies and foreign companies with whom we conduct business, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits, and our properties in Mexico could be subject to expropriation by the Mexican government.\nWe are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our proposed ECA LNG projects are expected to be situated, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may have or seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure located on land we do not own for a specific period of time. If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities, which could delay or derail proposed projects, increase our development costs, and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs, fines or penalties. In addition, disputes regarding any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSempra Infrastructure\u2019s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.", "PERMNO": 86136, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "SRE"}
