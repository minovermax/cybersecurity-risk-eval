During economic downturns and periods of stagnant or slow economic growth, federal and state budgets are typically negatively affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or delayed payments by the federal and state government health care coverage programs in which we participate, including Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state assistance plans. Government programs could also slow or temporarily suspend payments on Medicaid obligations, negatively impacting our cash flow and increasing our working capital needs and interest payments. We have seen, and believe we will continue to see, Medicare and state Medicaid programs institute measures aimed at controlling spending growth, including reductions in reimbursement rates.\nHigher unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may lead to lower numbers of patients enrolled in employer-provided plans. Adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering, or limit, healthcare coverage, or modify program designs, shifting more costs to the individual and exposing us to greater credit risk from patients or the discontinuance of therapy.\nExisting and new government legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d Changes in these regulations may require extensive changes to our systems and operations that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; suspension of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs; or loss of licensure. Reduction in reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payors could adversely affect our business as well. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Anti-Kickback laws; federal and state laws prohibiting self-referrals or \u201cStark laws\u201d; HIPAA, as amended by HITECH; False Claims Act; Civil Monetary Penalties Act; regulations of the FDA, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and the DEA, and regulations of individual state regulatory authorities. In that regard, our business and consolidated financial statements could be affected by one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, including state and federal controlled substances laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nFDA and/or state regulation affecting the pharmacy industries;\n\u2022\nrules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and HITECH; and other federal and state laws affecting the use, disclosure and transmission of health information, such as state security breach notification laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;\n\u2022\nadministration of Medicare and state Medicaid programs, including legislative changes and/or rulemaking and interpretation;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations that require reporting and public dissemination of payments to and between various health care providers and other industry participants;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists;\n\u2022\nmanaged care reform and plan design legislation, including state laws regarding out-of-network charges and participation;\n\u2022\nfederal or state laws governing our relationships with physicians or others in a position to refer to us; and\n\u2022\ninterpretation and enforcement of the DQSA.\nThe Health Reform Law and its implementation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Health Reform Law has resulted and will continue to result in sweeping changes to the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care. While many regulations have already been promulgated, further implementation of certain of the requirements under the Health Reform Law will depend on the promulgation of regulations by a number of federal government agencies, including the HHS. It is also possible that the Health Reform Law may be repealed or amended, in whole or in part. It is impossible to predict the outcome of these changes and the net effect of those requirements on us. As such, we cannot predict the impact of the Health Reform Law on our business, operations or financial performance.\nFederal actions and legislation may reduce reimbursement rates from governmental payors and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn August 2011, Congress passed a deficit reduction agreement that created a committee tasked with proposing legislation to reduce the federal deficit by November 23, 2011. Because the committee did not act, automatic Medicare cuts were scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2013. However, Congress passed legislation extending the time for such cuts by three months. Thus, Medicare reimbursement to providers was reduced overall by 2% (as part of sequestration) beginning April 1, 2013. The automatic spending cuts did not and will not have an impact on Medicaid reimbursement. The reductions in Medicare reimbursement have not yet been significant but they could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThese reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending. From time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state\u2019s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and/or enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs. The current economic environment has increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in many states. In addition, the Cures Act significantly reduced the amount paid by Medicare for the drug costs, while delaying the implementation of a clinical services payment until 2021.\nIn some cases, Third Party Payors rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from Third Party Payors. Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes to Third Party Payors in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face periodic reviews and billing audits from governmental and private payors, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews and audits to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. If billing errors are identified in the sample of reviewed claims, the billing error can be extrapolated to all claims filed which could result in a larger overpayment than originally identified in the sample of reviewed claims. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews and audits may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review or audit could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid by governmental or private payors;\n\u2022\nstate or Federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks; or\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf any of our pharmacies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that pharmacy could be terminated from Medicare, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOur pharmacies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. These conditions vary depending on the type of facility, but, in general, require our facilities to meet specified standards relating to licensure, personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, physical site, administrative reporting and legal compliance. If a pharmacy fails to meet any of the Medicare supplier standards, that pharmacy could be terminated from the Medicare program. We respond in the ordinary course to deficiency notices issued by surveyors, and none of our pharmacies has ever been terminated from the Medicare program for failure to comply with the supplier standards. Any termination of one or more of our pharmacies from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the Medicare supplier standards could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe cannot predict the impact of new requirements on compounding pharmacies.\nCompounding pharmacies have come under increasing scrutiny from federal and state governmental agencies. We believe that our compounding is done in safe environments and we have clinically appropriate policies and procedures in place. We only compound pursuant to a patient specific prescription and do so in compliance with USP 797 standards. In November 2013, Congress passed the DQSA, which creates a new category of compounders called outsourcing facilities, which are newly-regulated by the FDA. We do not believe that our current compounding practices qualify us as an outsourcing facility and therefore we continue to operate in compliance with USP 797 standards. Should state regulators or the FDA disagree, or should our business practices change to qualify us as an outsourcing facility, there is a risk of regulatory action and/or increased resources required to comply with federal requirements imposed by the DQSA on outsourcing facilities that would significantly increase our costs or otherwise affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot predict the implications and overall impact of increased scrutiny on compounding pharmacies.\nCompetition in the healthcare industry may adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry is very competitive. Our competitors include large and well-established companies that may have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. Some of our competitors are under common control with, or owned by, pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers or retail pharmacy chains and may be better positioned with respect to the cost-effective distribution of pharmaceuticals. In addition, some of our competitors may have secured long-term supply or distribution arrangements for prescription pharmaceuticals necessary to treat certain chronic disease states on price terms substantially more favorable than the terms currently available to us. As a result of such advantageous pricing, we may be less price competitive than some of these competitors with respect to certain pharmaceutical products. Our competitive position could also be adversely affected by any inability to obtain access to new biotech pharmaceutical products.\nChanges in the case mix of patients, as well as payment methodologies, payor mix or pricing could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenue are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Changes in the case mix of the patients, payment methodologies, payor mix or pricing among private pay, Medicare and Medicaid may significantly affect our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our financial performance.\nContracts within our business generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for the reimbursement of prescription medications dispensed by us. These benchmarks include AWP, wholesale acquisition cost and average manufacturer price. Many of our contracts utilize the AWP benchmark. As a part of the settlement of class-action lawsuits brought against First DataBank and Medi-Span, effective September 26, 2009, both companies announced they would cease publication of the AWP pricing benchmarks at the end of 2011. First DataBank ceased publication of the AWP pricing benchmarks on September 28, 2011. Without a suitable pricing benchmark in place many of our contracts will have to be modified and could potentially change\nthe economic structure of our agreements. As of the date of this report, a viable generally accepted alternative to the AWP benchmark has not been developed by the industry, and Medi-Span has announced they will continue to publish AWP until a new benchmark is widely accepted.\nCompetitive bidding could reduce our volumes and profitability.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established requirements for a competitive bidding program for determining Medicare reimbursement rates for certain items of DMEPOS, including enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment, certain respiratory therapy and home medical equipment products and external infusion pumps and supplies. CMS has the discretion to determine which products will be subject to competitive bidding.\nAlthough we are contract suppliers under the Round 1 Recompete and Round 2 of competitive bidding and have entered into strategic relationships in the CBAs in which we were not awarded contracts, the prices paid under the competitive bid contracts are below what Medicare had previously paid. Because of this, even in CBAs where we continue to provide competitively bid items to Medicare beneficiaries, we have seen and may continue to see decreased revenues. Continued expansion of the competitive bidding program could also have a negative impact on our revenue if we are not a successful bidder in many or all of the CBAs for the product categories included that we offer. We were not awarded any contracts in Round 2 Recompete, which went into effect July 1, 2016 and includes 117 CBAs, comprising the same geographic areas as the second round of competitive bidding, and seven product categories, including enteral nutrition. Our revenue may decrease unless and until we are able to provide Medicare beneficiaries with competitively bid items in the applicable CBAs. The establishment of new DMEPOS fee schedule pricing for areas where competitive bidding is not implemented, which is based on competitive bid prices, could have a further negative impact on our revenue.\nContract renewals, or lack thereof, with key revenue sources and key business relationships could result in less favorable pricing, loss of exclusivity and/or reduced distribution and access to customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are renegotiating, on a rolling basis, contracts and business relationships with key revenue sources, including Third Party Payors. Our future growth and success depends on our ability to maintain these relationships and renew such contracts on acceptable terms. However, we may not be able to continue to maintain these relationships which grant us access to certain customers and distribution channels. Any break in these key business relationships could result in lost contracts and reduce our access to certain customers and distribution channels. Further, when these contracts near expiration, we may not be able to successfully renegotiate acceptable terms. Any increase in pricing or loss of exclusivity could result in reduced margins. Accordingly, it is possible that our ongoing efforts to renew contracts and business relationships with such key revenue sources as Third Party Payors could result in less favorable pricing, loss of exclusivity or even reduced access to customers and distribution channels, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even when such contracts are renewed, they may be renewed for only a short term or may be terminable on relatively short notice.\nWe and certain of our former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in a derivative complaint that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future.\nCertain of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in a derivative complaint (the \u201cDerivative Complaint\u201d) that generally alleges that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duties with respect to the Company\u2019s public disclosures, oversight of Company operations, secondary stock offerings and stock sales. The Company is also named as a nominal defendant in the Derivative Complaint. The Derivative Complaint also contends that certain defendants aided and abetted those alleged breaches. The damages sought are not quantified but include, among other things, claims for money damages, restitution, disgorgement, equitable relief, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses, and interest. On June 16, 2015, all defendants moved to dismiss the case. Briefing for the motion to dismiss was completed on November 30, 2015, and the court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on January 12, 2016. During the hearing, the court requested additional briefing, which was completed on February 12, 2016. On May 31, 2016, the court determined that the plaintiff\u2019s claims could not proceed as pled but granted the plaintiff thirty days in which to make a motion to amend the Derivative Complaint. The court reserved decision on the motion to dismiss and on June 29, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On October 10, 2016, all defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the Court heard oral argument on January 19, 2017.\nThe Company, the director defendants and the officer defendants deny any allegations of wrongdoing in this lawsuit. The Company and those persons believe all of the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against these claims. However, there is no assurance that the defense will be successful or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement, judgment or litigation costs associated with this action. Certain of the defendants have sought indemnification\nfrom the Company pursuant to certain indemnification agreements, for which there may be no insurance coverage. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.\nAny conclusion in this matter in a manner adverse to us would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Even if we were to be successful in the defense of the litigation, we could incur substantial costs not covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other priorities, including the execution of business plans and strategies that are important to our ability to grow our business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, while we believe based on current information that this matter is covered by applicable insurance and we intend to engage in a vigorous defense of the lawsuit, nevertheless, this matter could require payments (including payments with respect of legal expenses) that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our available directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPending and future litigation could subject us to significant monetary damages and/or require us to change our business practices.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation and other proceedings in connection with our operations, including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for a description of material proceedings pending against us. We believe that these suits are without merit and, to the extent not already concluded, intend to contest them vigorously. However, an adverse outcome in one or more of these suits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position and/or consolidated cash flow from operations, or may require us to make material changes to our business practices.\nWe periodically respond to subpoenas and requests for information from governmental agencies. To our knowledge, we are not a target or a potential subject of a criminal investigation. But we cannot predict with certainty whether we may in the future become a target or potential target of an investigation or the subject of further inquiries or ultimately settlements with respect to the subject matter of any subpoenas. In addition to potential monetary liability arising from suits and proceedings, from time to time we incur costs in providing documents to government agencies. Current pending claims and associated costs may be covered by our insurance, but certain other costs are not insured. Such costs may increase and/or continue to be material to our performance in the future.\nIn addition, as we continue our strategic assessment and cost reduction efforts, there is an increased risk of employment and workers compensation-related litigation and/or administrative claims brought against us. We would defend against any and all such litigation and claims, as appropriate. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any particular reporting period.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to a variety of operational and financial risks.\nA principal element of our historic business strategy has been to grow by acquiring other companies and assets in the home infusion and complementary businesses. Growth, especially rapid growth, through acquisitions exposes us to a variety of operational and financial risks. We summarize the most significant of these risks below.\nIntegration risks. We must integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations. This process includes the integration of the various components of our business (including the following) and of the businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future:\n\u2022\nhealth care professionals and employees who are not familiar with our policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nclients who may terminate their relationships with us;\n\u2022\nkey employees who may seek employment elsewhere;\n\u2022\npatients who may elect to switch to another health care provider;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance programs; and\n\u2022\ndisparate operating, information and record keeping systems and technology platforms.\nIntegrating an acquisition could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel from day-to-day operations.\nWe may not be able to combine successfully the operations of acquired companies with our operations, and, even if such integration is accomplished, we may never realize the potential benefits of the acquisition. The integration of acquisitions requires\nsignificant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects and may impose challenges on the combined business including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies and business cultures. If we fail to complete ongoing integration efforts, we may never fully realize the potential benefits of the related acquisitions.\nBenefits may not materialize. When evaluating potential acquisition targets, we identify potential synergies and cost savings that we expect to realize upon the successful completion of the acquisition and the integration of the related operations. We may, however, be unable to achieve or may otherwise never realize the expected benefits. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from improvements to companies we acquire are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as changes to government regulation governing or otherwise impacting our industry, reductions in reimbursement rates from Third Party Payors, reductions in service levels under our contracts, operating difficulties, client preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these improvements or if we do not achieve our expected results, it may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAssumptions of unknown liabilities. Companies that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. We may incur material liabilities for the past activities of acquired operations. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business through lower-than-expected operating results, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets or otherwise.\nCompeting for acquisitions. We face competition for acquisition candidates primarily from other home infusion and other healthcare companies. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. As a result, we may pay more to acquire a target business or may agree to less favorable deal terms than we would have otherwise. Accurately assessing the value of acquisition candidates is often very challenging. Also, suitable acquisitions may not be available due to unfavorable terms.\nFurther, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for in an acquisition, the acquired entity\u2019s results of operations, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, effects of subsequent legislation and limits on rate increases.\nImproving financial results. Some of the operations we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have had significantly lower operating margins than our current operations. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the companies we acquire, operate such companies profitably or effectively integrate the operations of the acquired companies, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments and strategic relationships involve certain risks.\nWe intend to pursue opportunistic acquisitions, strategic investments in, or strategic relationships with businesses and technologies. Acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including difficulties in assessing values for acquired businesses, intangible assets and technologies, difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies, amortization of acquired intangible assets which could reduce future reported earnings, and potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies. We may not be able to successfully fully integrate the operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Strategic investments may also entail some of the risks described above. If these investments are unsuccessful, we may need to incur charges against earnings. We may also pursue a number of strategic relationships. These relationships and others we may enter into in the future may be important to our business and growth prospects. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or develop new strategic alliances.\nWe may not be able to identify strategic acquisition candidates or strategic investment or relationship opportunities.\nWe intend to continue to explore strategic alternatives for the Company including to identify new business acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to identify such new strategic alternatives or business acquisition opportunities to continue to execute our strategy.\nWe may incur significant costs in connection with our evaluation of new business opportunities and suitable acquisition candidates.\nOur management intends to identify, analyze and evaluate potential new business opportunities, including possible acquisition and merger candidates. We may incur significant costs, such as due diligence and legal and other professional fees and expenses,\nas part of these efforts. Notwithstanding these efforts and expenditures, we may not be able to identify an appropriate new business opportunity, or any acquisition opportunity, in the near term, or at all.\nWe may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance.\nA successful product or professional liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our consolidated financial statements. Various aspects of our business may subject us to litigation and liability for damages. For example, a prescription drug dispensing error could result in a patient receiving the wrong or incorrect amount of medication, leading to personal injury or death. Our business and consolidated financial statements could suffer if we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of any applicable contractual indemnity or insurance coverage.\nChanges in our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including changes in drug availability or pricing, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers to purchase the drugs that we dispense. Any changes to these relationships, including, but not limited, to loss of a manufacturer relationship, drug shortages or changes in pricing, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe purchase a majority of our pharmaceutical products from one vendor and a disruption in our purchasing arrangements could adversely impact our business.\nWe purchase a majority of our prescription products, subject to certain minimum periodic purchase levels and excluding purchases of therapeutic plasma products, from a single wholesaler, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (\u201cABDC\u201d), pursuant to a prime vendor agreement. The term of this agreement extends until December 2019, subject to extension for up to two additional years. Any significant disruption in our relationship with ABDC, or in ABDC\u2019s supply and timely delivery of products to us, would make it difficult and possibly more costly for us to continue to operate our business until we are able to execute a replacement wholesaler agreement. If that were to occur, we may not be able to find a replacement wholesaler on a timely basis. Further, such wholesaler may not be able to fulfill our demands on similar financial terms and service levels. If we are unable to identify a replacement on substantially similar financial terms and/or service levels, our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected.\nA disruption in supply could adversely impact our business.\nWe also source pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment from other manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers. Most of the pharmaceuticals that we purchase are available from multiple sources, and we believe they are available in sufficient quantities to meet our needs and the needs of our patients. We keep safety stock to ensure continuity of service for reasonable, but limited, periods of time. Should a supply disruption result in the inability to obtain especially high margin drugs and compound components, our consolidated financial statements could be negatively impacted.\nPrescription volumes may decline, and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted, when products are withdrawn from the market or when increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs result in utilization decreases.\nWe dispense significant volumes of prescription medications from our pharmacies. Our dispensing volume is the principal driver of revenue and profitability. When products are withdrawn by manufacturers, or when increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases, physicians may cease writing or reduce the numbers of prescriptions written for these higher-risk drugs. Additionally, negative media reports regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced consumer demand for such drugs. In cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs, our prescription volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline.\nHome infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe home infusion industry is currently seeing renewed activity in the formation of equity-based infusion joint ventures formed with hospitals. This activity stems, in part, from hospitals seeking to position themselves for new paradigms in the delivery of coordinated healthcare and new methods of payment, including an emerging interdisciplinary care model forming that is being labeled as an accountable care organization. These organizations are encouraged by the new Health Reform Law. These entities are being designed in order to save money and improve quality of care by better integrating care, with the healthcare provider possibly sharing in the financial benefits of the new efficiencies.\nParticipation in equity-based joint ventures offer hospitals and other providers an opportunity to more efficiently transfer patients to less expensive care settings, while keeping the patient within its network. Additionally, it provides many hospitals with a mechanism to invest accumulated profits in a growing sector with attractive margins.\nIf these home infusion joint ventures continue to expand, then we could lose referrals and our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected. Also, there are risks and costs associated with joint venture participation. We consider joint ventures with hospitals from time to time.\nA shortage of qualified registered nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals could adversely affect our ability to attract, train and retrain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs.\nOur business relies significantly on its ability to attract and retain nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of their job responsibilities. From time to time and particularly in recent years, there have been shortages of nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals in certain local and regional markets. As a result, we are often required to compete for personnel with other healthcare systems and our competitors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide them with engaging assignments and competitive salaries and benefits. We may not be successful in any of these areas.\nIn addition, where labor shortages arise in markets in which we operate, we may face higher costs to attract personnel, and we may have to provide them with more attractive benefit packages than originally anticipated or are being paid in other markets where such shortages don\u2019t exist at the time. In either case, such circumstances could cause our profitability to decline. Finally, if we expand our operations into geographic areas where healthcare providers historically have unionized or unionization occurs in our existing geographic areas, negotiating collective bargaining agreements may have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and on our financial results. If we are unable to attract and retain nursing staff, pharmacists and other professionals, the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources.\nIntroduction of new drugs or accelerated adoption of existing lower margin drugs could cause us to experience lower revenues and profitability when prescribers prescribe these drugs for their patients or they are mandated by third party payors.\nThe pharmaceutical industry pipeline of new drugs includes many drugs that over the long term may replace older, more expensive therapies. As a result of such older drugs going off patent and being replaced by generic substitutes, new and less expensive delivery methods (such as when an infusion or injectable drug is replaced with an oral drug) or additional products are added to a therapeutic class, thereby increasing price competition among competing manufacturer\u2019s products in that therapeutic category. In such cases, manufacturers have the ability to increase drug acquisition costs or lower the selling price of replaced products. This could have the effect of lowering our revenues and/or margins.\nActs of God such as major weather disturbances could disrupt our business.\nWe operate in a network of prescribers, providers, patients and facilities that can be negatively impacted by local weather disturbances and other force majeure events. For example, in anticipation of major weather events, patients with impaired health may be moved to alternate sites. After a major weather event, availability of electricity, clean water and transportation can impact our ability to provide service in the home. In addition, acts of God and other force majeure events may cause a reduction in our business or increased costs, such as increased costs in our operations as we incur overtime charges or redirect services to other locations, delays in our ability to work with payors, hospitals, physicians and other strategic partners on new business initiatives, and disruption to referral patterns as patients are moved out of facilities affected by such events or are unable to return to sites of service in the home.\nFailure to develop new services or adapt to changes and trends within the industry may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We develop new services from time to time to assist our clients. If we are unsuccessful in developing innovative services, our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients may suffer.\nTechnology is also an important component of our business as we continue to utilize new and better channels to communicate and interact with our clients, members and business partners. If our competitors are more successful than us in employing this technology, our ability to attract new clients, retain existing clients and operate efficiently may suffer. Any significant shifts in the structure of the healthcare products and services industry in general could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCybersecurity risks could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which may harm our ability to operate effectively and may cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nCybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, or damage. We rely on our information systems to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information about our patients, customers and personnel, such as names, addresses and other individually identifiable information protected by HIPAA and other privacy laws. Cyber-attacks are increasingly more common, including in the health care industry. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and with rapidly evolving industry standards may result in our incurring significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nWe have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised any confidential information. We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.\nSecurity breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions or shutdowns or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If personal information or protected health information is improperly accessed, tampered with or disclosed as a result of a security breach, we may incur significant costs to notify and mitigate potential harm to the affected individuals, and we may be subject to sanctions and civil or criminal penalties if we are found to be in violation of the privacy or security rules under HIPAA or other similar federal or state laws protecting confidential personal information. In addition, a security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties for compromised personal information and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on maintaining a well-secured business and technology infrastructure.\nWe are dependent on our infrastructure, including our information systems, for many aspects of our business operations. A fundamental requirement for our business is the secure storage and transmission of protected health information and other confidential data. Our business and operations may be harmed if we do not maintain our business processes and information systems in a secure manner, and maintain and continually improve the integrity of our confidential information. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information against security breaches, failure to protect our confidential information or mitigate harm caused by such breaches may adversely affect our operating results. Malfunctions in our business processes, breaches of our information systems or the failure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems could disrupt our business operations, result in customer and member disputes, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation, result in regulatory violations and related costs and penalties, increase administrative expenses or lead to other adverse consequences.\nOur business is dependent on the services provided by third party information technology vendors.\nOur information technology infrastructure includes hosting services provided by third parties. While we believe these third parties are high-performing organizations with secure platforms and customary certifications, they could suffer a security breach or business interruption which in turn could impact our operations negatively. In addition, changes in pricing terms charged by our technology vendors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur failure to maintain controls and processes over billing and collecting could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe collection of accounts receivable is a significant challenge, and requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. If we are unable to properly bill and collect our accounts receivable, our results could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays in payment may adversely affect our working capital.\nOur business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services. If we have difficulty in obtaining documentation, experience information system problems or experience other issues that arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter additional delays in our payment cycle.\nIn addition, timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare or other provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal tax purposes is subject to limitation and risk that could further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in a corporation\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change NOLs equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation for a taxable year generally is increased by the amount of any \u201crecognized built-in gains\u201d for such year and the amount of any unused annual limitation in a prior year. Any limitation to our annual use of NOLs could require us to pay a greater amount of U.S. federal (and in some cases, state) income taxes, which could reduce our after-tax income from operations for future taxable years and adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe issuance of shares of our Preferred Stock reduced the percentage interests of our other stockholders, and any future exercise of the Class A and Class B Warrants will further reduce the percentage interests of our other stockholders.\nOn March 9, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P., Coliseum Capital Partners II, L.P., and Blackwell Partners, LLC, Series A (collectively, the \u201cPIPE Investors\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we issued and sold to the PIPE Investors in a private placement an aggregate of (a) 625,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), at a purchase price per share of $100.00, (b) 1,800,000 Class A warrants (the \u201cClass A Warrants\u201d), and (c) 1,800,000 Class B warrants (the \u201cClass B Warrants\u201d and, together with the Class A Warrants, the \u201cPIPE Warrants\u201d), for gross proceeds of $62.5 million. We also conducted a Rights Offering (as described below) pursuant to which we sold an additional 10,822 shares of Series A Preferred Stock along with the PIPE Warrants. On June 10, 2016, in order to facilitate the 2016 Equity Offering, the Company and the PIPE Investors agreed to exchange 614,177 shares of the existing Series A Preferred Stock for an identical number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On June 14, 2016, in order to facilitate the 2016 Equity Offering, the Company and the PIPE Investors agreed to exchange 614,177 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock for an identical number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). As a result of these exchanges, there are currently (a) 21,645 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, of which 10,823 shares are owned by the PIPE Investors, (b) no shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, and (c) 614,177 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding, all of which are owned by the PIPE Investors.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, if all holders of the Preferred Stock converted their shares in full, and exercised the PIPE Warrants in full, their aggregate beneficial ownership would be approximately 16% of our outstanding Common Stock. The issuance of the Preferred Stock to the PIPE Investors reduced the relative voting power and percentage ownership interests of our other current stockholders. The future exercise of the PIPE Warrants by the holders of those securities will cause a further reduction in the relative voting power and percentage ownership interests of our other stockholders.\nThe PIPE Investors may exercise influence over us, including through their ability to influence matters requiring the approval of holders of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock.\nHolders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis upon all matters upon which holders of our Common Stock have the right to vote. The shares of Preferred Stock owned by the PIPE Investors currently represent approximately 13% of the voting rights in respect of our share capital on an as-converted basis, and accordingly the PIPE Investors may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of most matters submitted for the vote of our stockholders. The PIPE Investors are currently the beneficial owners of 625,000 of the 635,822 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock.\nFurther, so long as shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represent at least 5% of our outstanding voting stock (on an as converted into Common Stock basis), the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to designate one member of the\nBoard by a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The PIPE Investors are currently the beneficial owners of all 614,177 issued and outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe PIPE Investors\u2019 majority ownership of our Series A and Series C Preferred Stock will limit the ability of any current or future holders of such series of Preferred Stock to influence corporate matters requiring the approval of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, including the right, voting as a separate class, to elect one director to our Board, and to approve certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation, or certain other changes, that would adversely affect the holders of the series of Preferred Stock. The PIPE Investors\u2019 voting power of the Preferred Stock may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our company to the extent that the consideration that would be received by the PIPE Investors and other holders of Preferred Stock in such acquisition or change of control is less than their liquidation preference, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the PIPE Investors, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders. Accordingly, the ownership position and the governance rights of the PIPE Investors could discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction with us. In any of these matters, the interests of the PIPE Investors may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, the PIPE Investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill to become further impaired, and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is an additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives.\nWe are required to test intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, annually and on an interim basis if an event occurs or there is a change in circumstance to indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. When the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value of goodwill, a charge to operations is recorded. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, a charge to operations is recognized. Either event would result in incremental expenses for that quarter, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred.\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the second quarter of 2015, we determined it was necessary to record a $238.0 million non-cash preliminary estimated impairment charge related to goodwill associated with our Infusion Services business. The preliminary estimated impairment took into consideration our updated business outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2015, pursuant to which we updated our future cash flow assumptions and calculated updated estimates of fair value. In determining the preliminary estimated impairment loss, we recorded an amount equal to the excess of the assets\u2019 carrying amount over its fair value as determined by an analysis of discounted future cash flows. During the third quarter of 2015, we finalized our impairment assessment and took an additional $13.9 million for a total impairment charge of $251.9 million. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we evaluated goodwill for possible impairment and concluded that no further impairment charge was needed (see Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets).\nOur goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, such as expected future cash flows, the degree of volatility in equity and debt markets, and our stock price. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Further, as we continue to work towards a turnaround of our business, we will need to continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill. Any additional impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness, which imposes operating and financial restrictions on us that, together with the resulting debt service obligations, may significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy and may increase the risk of default under our debt obligations.\nWe have entered into (i) a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), (ii) a senior secured first-lien term loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the \u201cTerm Loan B Facility\u201d) and (iii) a senior secured first-lien delayed draw term loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million (the \u201cDelayed Draw Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B Facility, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d). In January 2017, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities pursuant to which further borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are prohibited. In addition, in January 2017 we entered\ninto a new credit agreement (the \u201cPriming Credit Agreement\u201d) with certain existing lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities that provides an aggregate borrowing commitment of $25 million which was fully drawn at closing. The proceeds of the Priming Credit Agreement were used to permanently prepay a portion of the outstanding revolving loan balance under the Revolving Credit Facility, to cash collateralize letters of credit issued under the Senior Credit Facilities and to pay certain fees and expenses and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was fully funded in connection with the closing of our acquisition of the CarePoint Business, and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for such acquisition. The proceeds of all other loans advanced under the Senior Credit Facilities have been or will be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes of BioScrip and its subsidiaries, including acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures. Our indebtedness includes many covenants and restrictions that may significantly limit the types of strategic relationships and our ability to execute our business strategy.\nIn addition, we have issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.875% senior notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d). See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d The 2021 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all existing and future subsidiaries of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities, we used approximately $194.5 million of the net proceeds of the 2021 Notes offering to repay $59.3 million of our Revolving Credit Facility and $135.2 million related to the Term Loan Facilities. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes prior to maturity.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants of our debt instruments, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes, may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum EBITDA covenant, each as provided under the Sixth Amendment to the Senior Credit Facilities dated as of January 6, 2017 and the Priming Credit Agreement (collectively, the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d). In addition, subject to a number of important exceptions, the Senior Credit Facilities contain certain covenants and restrictions impacting our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and loans;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, redeem subordinated indebtedness, or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nincur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into hedging transactions or sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThe indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains similar restrictions. Our ability to comply with these covenants, including the financial covenants, may be affected by events beyond our control. Therefore, in order to engage in some corporate actions, we may need to seek permission from our lenders or the note holders, whose interests may be different from ours. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain consent from these parties when needed. If we do not comply with the restrictions and covenants in our Credit Agreements, we may not be able to finance our future operations, make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities. The restrictions contained in our Credit Agreements may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy the maximum first lien net leverage ratio, the minimum EBITDA covenant, or that the lenders under the Credit Agreements will waive any failure to meet that test.\nA breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratio could result in a default under the Credit Agreements. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the respective Credit Agreements may elect to declare all of their respective outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Under such circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nAlthough we entered into a First Amendment through Sixth Amendment with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities, there can be no assurance that we will be granted future waivers or amendments to the restrictions in the Credit Agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with such restrictions or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe lenders under the Credit Agreements also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders under the Credit Agreements could recover amounts owed to them by foreclosing against the collateral pledged to them. We have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to the lenders under the Credit Agreements, including the equity of all of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the degree to which we are leveraged could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt, reducing the availability of our cash flow and such proceeds to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; or\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities.\nTo service our indebtedness and other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Priming Credit Agreement, the Senior Credit Facilities, and the 2021 Notes, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. A significant reduction in our operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic conditions, changes in government reimbursement rates or methods, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial statements, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our indebtedness under the Priming Credit Agreement, Senior Credit Facilities, and 2021 Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our inability to pay our debts would require us to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness or selling equity capital. However, our alternative strategies may not be feasible at the time or may not provide adequate funds to allow us to pay our debts as they come due and fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, some alternative strategies are likely to require the prior consent of our senior secured lenders, which we may not be able to obtain.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still need to incur significantly more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future, in connection with future acquisitions, strategic investments and strategic relationships. Although the Credit Agreements and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes contain covenants and restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions, including secured debt, could be substantial. Adding additional debt to current debt levels could exacerbate the leverage-related risks described above.", "PERMNO": 83883, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "OPCH"}
