If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation could be harmed. You should also consider these risk factors when you read \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d elsewhere in this report. You can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d the negative of those terms or other comparable terms. Those forward-looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets in which we sell our products, particularly chemical companies, petroleum refineries, heavy-duty trucking, semiconductor manufacturing, capital equipment and the automotive industry, are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns. Prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales and results of operations. A prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our businesses. Customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase. To remain competitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products. This product commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition. Changes in the replacement cycle of certain of our products, including because of improved product quality or improved maintenance, may affect aftermarket demand for such products. Initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service, continuous improvement, innovation, customer relationships, technology, new product acquisitions, bundling with key services, long-term contracts or market focus may not be effective. Pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products, we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe marketing success of many of our businesses in the U.S. and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents\u2019 and distributors\u2019 sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets. Many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products. A loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors, or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships, could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased costs for raw materials, the termination of existing supply agreements or disruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in 2018. While we have been successful in passing along some of these higher costs, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers. Additionally, our Power Systems segment has entered into long-term contracts to manufacture and sell engines and generator sets which do not allow for price adjustments to recover additional costs resulting from increases in the costs of materials and components during the contract period, and accordingly material increases in relevant costs could adversely affect the profitability of these long-term contracts and the profits of that segment. Similarly, the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to previously owned businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any fiscal period.\nWe have contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations, including previously owned businesses of our predecessors, including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters. In some instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities, and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities.\nClaims could arise relating to products, facilities or other matters related to our discontinued operations. Some of these claims could seek substantial monetary payments. For example, EnPro has entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Interim Removal Action with the Environmental Protection Agency for the assessment and potential remediation of eight surface uranium mines in Arizona on the basis that our EnPro Holdings, Inc. subsidiary (\u201cEnPro Holdings\u201d), through which we hold all of our operating subsidiaries, was a potentially responsible party under federal environmental laws as the successor to a former operator in the 1950s of those mines. Similarly, in connection with a facility located in Water Valley, Mississippi, which was divested in 1996 and has trichloroethylene soil and groundwater contamination, EnPro has entered into an Agreed Order with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality requiring development and implementation of a corrective action work plan addressing both the sources of contamination at the facility and areas where the contamination has migrated, which include residential homes and commercial and local government facilities, and area homeowners, owners of commercial facilities and the local county government and possibly other private parties and individuals have filed suit against EnPro seeking recovery for alleged damage to their properties, including diminution in value. Further, we could potentially be liable with respect to firearms manufactured prior to March 1990 by Colt Firearms, a former operation of a corporate predecessor of EnPro Holdings, and electrical transformers manufactured prior to May 1994 by Central Moloney, another former operation of that corporate predecessor.\nWe have insurance and have established reserves related to some of these liabilities based upon our best estimates in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, if our insurance coverage is depleted or our reserves are not adequate, environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks, including foreign exchange risks, that may cause our profitability to decline.\nBecause we sell our products in a number of foreign countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. In 2018, we derived approximately 38% of our net sales from sales of our products outside of the U.S. We operate 26 primary manufacturing facilities located in 11 countries, outside the U.S. Our sales and operating activities outside of the U.S. are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including long-term contracts denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign tax, legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ngovernment embargoes, tariffs and trade protection measures, such as \u201canti-dumping\u201d duties applicable to classes of products, and import or export licensing requirements, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of \u201cnormal trade relations\u201d status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products or otherwise reduce our sales and harm our business;\n\u2022\ncultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our Code of Conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees, agents and distributors conduct business;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including instabilities associated with European sovereign debt uncertainties and the future continuity of membership of the European Union; and\n\u2022\nacts of hostility, terror or war.\nAny of these factors, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, tapered roller bearings manufactured at our facilities in China that are imported into the United States before re-sale to customers are currently subject to \u201canti-dumping\u201d duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce based on its periodic review and analysis of our manufacturing and selling activities or the manufacturing and selling activities of larger Chinese suppliers of these products. Such duties, if imposed at higher levels, could materially adversely affect the commercial competitiveness of these products, which could adversely affect the business and results of operations of our Sealing Products segment.\nOur operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities in countries outside the United States create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, we are subject to and must comply with all applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the United States and other various governments. Changes in export control or trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs and increase compliance costs, and violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions, such as loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business or debarments from export privileges. Violations of the FCPA or export controls or sanctions laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities, which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations. As we expand our international operations, we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with reputable and qualified local agents, distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing these relationships, we may not be able to increase sales in these regions.\nFailure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.\nWe believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how, our business and prospects could be negatively impacted. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Patents issued to third parties, whether before or after the issue date of our patents, could render our intellectual property less valuable. Questions as to whether our competitors\u2019 products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights may be disputed. In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions.\nOur competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology. Without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property, our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired, which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue. As a result, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nFailure to maintain or renew licenses to certain patent and technology rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn general, we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell. However, we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings. In several cases, the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products and certain services we perform. These licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated in the event of a material breach. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\u201d for a discussion of the status of renewal of certain licenses.\nReductions in the U.S. Navy\u2019s requirements for engines offered by Fairbanks Morse could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment and our business with the U.S. Navy and other governmental agencies is subject to government contracting risks.\nSales of new engines for use by the U.S. Navy by our Power Systems segment, which have been a significant component of that segment\u2019s revenues, are based on the U.S. Navy\u2019s long-term ship-building programs. Although the Power Systems segment has expanded its activities in other markets, including the sale of diesel engine generator sets for emergency back-up power at nuclear power plants in France, the resale of a German engine manufacturer's engines for use in the power generation industry in the U.S. and the introduction of its internally-developed Trident OP\u00ae engine, any decline in demand from the U.S. Navy could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment.\nOur business with the U.S. Navy, and other governmental agencies, including sales to prime contractors that supply these agencies, is subject to government contracting risks. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. In addition, if we or one of our divisions were charged with wrongdoing with respect to a U.S. government contract, the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts and void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including: difficulties integrating acquired technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur products are often used in critical applications, which could expose us to potentially significant product liability, warranty and other claims and recalls. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial condition.\nOur products are often used in critical applications in demanding environments, including in the nuclear, oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries. Accordingly, product failures can have significant consequences and could result in significant product liability, warranty and other claims against us, regardless of whether our products caused the incident that is the subject of the claim, and we may have obligations to participate in the recall of products in which our products are components, if any of the components we supply prove to be defective. We endeavor to identify and obtain in established markets insurance agreements to cover significant risks and liabilities, though insurance against some of the risks inherent in our operations (such as insurance covering down-stream customer product recalls) is either unavailable or available only at rates or on terms that we consider excessive. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we endeavor to\nobtain contractual protection against uninsured risks from our customers, including limitations on liability and indemnification. In some cases, we are unable to obtain such contractual protections, and when we do, such contractual protection may not be as broad as we desire, may not be supported by adequate insurance maintained by the customer, or may not be fully enforceable in the jurisdictions in which our customers are located. Such insurance or contractual protection may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim or product recall for which we are not insured or for which we are underinsured could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and, if litigation with the carrier becomes necessary, an outcome unfavorable to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of the products that we manufacture are sold to industries and used in applications that are susceptible to challenges from trends to address climate change or other trends favoring \u201cclean\u201d energy solutions.\nInternational trends favoring \u201cclean\u201d energy solutions to address climate change, sustainability and other environmental concerns may present challenges to a number of industries that we supply. These trends include increasing market replacement of vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines with electric-powered vehicles and increasing implementation of solar and wind energy solutions. In some jurisdictions, these trends have been spurred by applicable government regulation (including tax incentives), and similar or additional regulations may be adopted in the future in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, technological advances may accelerate the pace of these trends. Many of the products that we manufacture are used by industries and in applications that may face challenges from, and may be adversely affected by, these trends and, as a result, the demand for certain of our current products could be similarly adversely affected by these trends. Accordingly, we are subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to these trends. While we anticipate considering these trends in the continued development and implementation of our long-term strategy, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by these trends if they continue or accelerate at a pace that we do not anticipate.\nThe strategy of our Power Systems segment to deliver power generating systems depends on our ability to outsource various elements of the scope of this work to third parties, which may expose us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations.\nOur Power Systems segment is implementing a strategy to offer customers power generating systems, in which it depends on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services. The implementation of that strategy subjects us to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor could lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to these customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions could include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, union negotiations and other labor disputes. Current or future economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all. These factors may affect the timing and cost of completion of such projects and could adversely affect the business and results of operations of our Power Systems segment.\nThe strategy of our Power Systems segment includes development and commercialization of new power systems, including the Trident OP\u00ae engine to support growth, which involves significant investment and involves various risks and uncertainties. These new products may not achieve desired commercial or financial results.\nThe future growth of our Power Systems segment will depend, in part, on its ability to successfully develop and commercialize new product offerings, including the opposed piston engine currently in development which is being marketed as the Trident OP\u00ae engine. Investments in developing new products such as the Trident OP\u00ae engine involve varying degrees of\nuncertainties and risk, including whether a new product designed to meet specific performance, cost and safety criteria can be successfully developed in a cost effective manner and our ability to internally develop, or to license or purchase from third parties, technologies critical to new product development. Commercial success of new products depends on many factors, including the levels of innovation, the development costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing products (including the duration of our exclusive use of technologies critical to our new products), our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of production, distribution and marketing efforts, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new products. We may not achieve significant revenues from new product development investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products may not be profitable, and, even if they are profitable, our operating margins from new products may not be as high as the margins we anticipate or have experienced historically.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to grow faster than general inflation. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses to the extent expected or required. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations, which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes, or changes to the magnitude of costs at existing environmental sites. Use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters, political insurgencies, pandemics and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nA relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability.\nBecause our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs. Small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall. Other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of customer contracts;\n\u2022\nthe timing of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nincreases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable tax rates;\n\u2022\nan impairment of goodwill or other intangibles at one of our reporting units;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of contractual penalties for the late delivery of long lead-time products;\n\u2022\nannouncements by competitors of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration;\n\u2022\nmajor changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business;\n\u2022\ncosts related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nan increase in the number or magnitude of product liability or environmental claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations, particularly outside the U.S.; and\n\u2022\neconomic assumptions and market factors used to determine post-retirement benefits and pension liabilities.\nVarious provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of North Carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of 5% or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nregulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans, including shares to be issued upon the vesting of restricted stock or unit grants. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur debt agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes impose limitations on our operations, which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investments and/or pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the new notes impose limitations on our operations, such as limitations on certain restricted payments, investments, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness, and maintenance of a consolidated net leverage ratio and an interest coverage financial ratio. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains limitations on certain restricted payments, investments and incurrence or repayment of indebtedness. These limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investment needs and/or pursue business opportunities.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to fund a required repurchase of the new notes upon a change of control.\nUpon a change of control, as defined under the indenture governing the new notes and includes events that may be beyond our control, the holders of the new notes have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the new notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the new notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the new notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture governing the new notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt.", "PERMNO": 89406, "SIC": 3050, "TIC": "NPO"}
