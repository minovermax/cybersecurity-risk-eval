{"cik": "855612", "company": "ZIX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business, financial condition and financial results. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business depends upon customers using email and certain social media platforms to exchange confidential information, and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur customers deploy and use our products and services to easily, securely and confidentially send and receive electronic messages, by way of internet communications channels including email and certain social media platforms. Our business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email and social media to exchange sensitive information electronically. New technologies, products, or business models that could support migration to alternative means of secure communications could be disruptive to our business. If prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than email or the social media platforms that we support, our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on market acceptance of our products and services, and our failure to achieve and maintain influential customers could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn order to continue to operate profitably and grow, we must achieve and maintain broad market acceptance of our products and services at a price that provides us with an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs. We have been successful in selling our Email Encryption products and services to high-profile customers in the healthcare, financial services and government segments of the market. The acceptance and use of our products and services by those significant customers facilitates our sales to other potential customers, and an expanding base of users in the Zix Directory aids in our market penetration and expansion. The loss of an influential customer of our existing products and services, or the failure to achieve sufficient market adoption of new products including ZixProtect and ZixArchive, could impair our ability to expand the market penetration of our products and services, or cause us to reduce or increase prices, which could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on securing new customer subscriptions and subscription renewals from existing customers.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is derived from customer subscriptions, and existing customers have no contractual obligations to purchase beyond the initial subscription or contract period. Our ability to grow our business is dependent in part on customers renewing their existing subscriptions and purchasing additional solutions or services after the initial term of their agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of certain products and services offered by us. If our customers cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or products during renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of attrition with existing customers and we may not maintain historical subscription rates, and we may be unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates. Although we have historically retained approximately 90% of our recurring revenue on an annual basis, there has been some recent decline in such retention and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may further decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our products and technical support services, customer merger or acquisition activity, customer budgets, the pricing of our products compared with those offered by our competitors, technology trends, the prevailing regulatory regime and general market conditions. If new subscriptions or subscription renewals decline from their current levels, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe security of our networks and data centers is critical to our business and an actual or perceived breach of security through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe are dependent on our networks and data centers to provide our products and services. Due to the nature of the products and services we provide and the sensitive nature of the information we collect, process, store, use and transmit, we may face cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses and other similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error that attempt to penetrate and could harm our networks and data centers. Our business depends on customers having and maintaining confidence that we provide effective network and security protection. To reduce the risk of a successful cyber-attack or similar event, we have implemented significant physical and logical security measures to detect, identify and mitigate threats as well as to monitor for and respond to potential breaches and incidents. Despite these security measures, our networks and data centers may remain vulnerable. We may not be able to correct a security flaw or particular vulnerability promptly, or at all. Further efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt or undermine our security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful. If a cyber-attack or other breach of security occurs, or is perceived to have occurred, in our internal systems or at our data centers and networks, it could cause negative publicity, interruption of our services, damage to our reputation, unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information (including personally identifiable information), disclosure of our intellectual property, disclosure, modification or removal of our confidential or sensitive information, theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets, loss of customers, lost revenue and increased expense (including potentially indemnification or warranty costs), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nPublic key cryptography technology used in our businesses is subject to technology integrity risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business employs public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. The security afforded by encryption depends on the integrity of the private key, which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key. Successful decryption of intercepted encrypted email, or public reports of successful decryption, whether or not true, could reduce demand for our products and services. If new methods or technologies, such as quantum computing, make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key, the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become less marketable. That could require us to make significant changes to our products and services, which could increase our costs, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any of these events could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends substantially on our data center facilities and other systems and infrastructure provided by third parties, and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of computer, cloud and telecommunications infrastructure to provide our products and services through the global Internet and to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. Much of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in North America and in the United Kingdom. Our data centers might be damaged or interrupted as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including fire, flood, power loss, mechanical failure, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, sabotage, vandalism, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet, infrastructure supplied by third parties or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Problems affecting our data center operations or the networks on which we rely, whether or not in our control, could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs, and may cause our customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements. We do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, the occurrence of any of these events, including multiple supplier outages or problems, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOutages or problems with internet communication systems and infrastructure supplied by third parties could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of the telecommunications and internet infrastructure. We use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our products and services. If those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable, real-time access to our systems, we may be unable to gain or retain customers. These suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems as a result of internal system failures or external third-party actions. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, multiple supplier outages or problems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe infrastructure supporting our business may suffer capacity constraints and business interruptions that could cause us to lose customers, increase our operating costs and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends on our providing our customers reliable, real-time access to our data centers and networks. Customers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service levels, service outages, or insufficient capacity. System capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business or network traffic could cause interruptions, outages or delays in our services, or deterioration in their performance, or could impair our ability to process transactions. We may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our systems or to timely increase capacity to accommodate increased traffic on our systems. System delays or interruptions may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties, which could result in our losing customers and revenues, or incurring liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe growth of our business may require significant investment in systems and infrastructure and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected benefits, which could impair our profitability and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nAs our operations grow in size and scope, we continually need to improve and upgrade our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and pursuing reduced costs per transaction. Expanding our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that the volume of our business will increase, which could reduce our net income, deplete our cash, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. Developing and launching new product offerings adjacent to or outside of our core service offerings can be particularly costly in terms of capital investments for both product development and marketing. At the same time, these new offerings involve greater uncertainty concerning both market acceptance and our ability to successfully execute a sales and marketing strategy that justifies our investments. Our failure to properly manage and execute new product initiatives could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable customer agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their customer agreements, which are typically one year or two years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from customer agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed client agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nOur failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements. We must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, to keep pace with these developments. We must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments, devices, industry trends, certifications and standards. For example, we have been required to expand our offerings for virtual computer environments and mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices. We also may need to develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing, popular operating systems. Our business could be harmed by our competitors announcing or introducing new products and services that could be perceived by customers as superior to ours. We spend considerable resources on technology research and development, but our research and development resources are more limited than many of our competitors.\nIn addition, we are also focused on addressing new and accelerating market trends, such as the continued decline of on premise email security and advance threat protection solution(s) and the continued transition towards cloud-based solutions, which requires us to continue to improve our product and service offerings. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our new and existing products and services, such as mobile device data protection, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe face strong competition, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies and are very competitive. With rising demand for private and secure email communications, there is strong competition for email encryption products and services. Our Email Encryption Threat Protection, Archive, and Data Loss Prevention business competes with products and services offered by companies such as Barracuda Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, MIMECast, and Virtru. Our ZixOne business competes with products and services offered by companies such as AirWatch/VMWare, Citrix (with XenMobile), Blackberry, IBM/Fiberlink (with MaaS360), and MobileIron. Strong competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers. Our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived by customers as equivalent to, or having advantages over, our products and services. Competitors could capture a significant share in our markets, causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures are often formed that create products competitive with our products. Competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs. Increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services. Competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may negatively affect our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our industry for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome competitors have advantages that may allow them to compete more effectively than us, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, more extensive operations, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, bigger product development and acquisition budgets, established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors, and greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These advantages might enable them (independently or through alliances) to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can, to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can, or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours. These advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business may be negatively affected.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to sell additional solutions to our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new clients or increasing sales to our existing client base, our business will be harmed.\nIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.\nWe have entered into several strategic alliances with other companies to offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects or series of projects, and their main goal is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these partner companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.\nWe enlist third-party distributors to market our products and services, and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe distribute a significant percentage of our products and services by entering into alliances with third parties who can offer our products and services along with their own or our competitors\u2019 products and services. Increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, we have limited control over and visibility into the sales cycles of third-party distributors, which could increase the length of our sales cycle, cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue. In addition, we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances. Companies with which we have marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us, form marketing alliances with our competitors, or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours. If a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us, we could experience an interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline. Our failure to develop, maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur future growth and success may be affected by acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions, our operating results and prospects could be negatively affected.\nWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire new products and technology, as well as customers, through acquisitions. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisition we complete may not be successful. Acquisitions we pursue, including our recent AppRiver acquisition, involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies and assets we acquire;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the customers, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses and products we acquire;\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset increased expenses generally associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in predicting or achieving synergies and cost savings between our existing businesses and acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including liabilities arising out of their failure to operate correctly, maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or unanticipated expenses associated with development work that is necessary to achieve interoperability between our products and solutions and the products and solutions we acquire;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or unanticipated expenses associated with migrating customers from products and solutions developed by our acquisition targets to our own products and solutions;\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance as a busines\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of intangible assets that we are required to record on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. These events and circumstances could include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. Such events and circumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our intangible assets, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nUnfavorable economic environments, particularly in the U.S., could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nChallenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may contribute to future slowdowns in the technology and networking industries at large, as well as in the email/data security market and in specific geographic markets in which we operate. If economic growth in those markets, particularly in the U.S., which accounts for a substantial majority of our revenue, slows, or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost, current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, including the deployment or expansion of our products and services. Additionally, as we continue along our path of\nexploring additional international markets, we may become more susceptible to unfavorable economic environments outside the U.S. and that could compound the negative effects of unfavorable economic environments in markets in which we currently operate. This could result in reduced sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, adverse economic conditions could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers and distributors, which might result in failures or delays in payments to us. This could increase our credit risk exposure and delay our recognition of revenue. Specific economic trends, such as declines in the demand for cloud computing services and computing devices, or softness in corporate information technology spending, could have a more direct impact on our business. If these conditions persist, spread or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products do not work properly or have security vulnerabilities, our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity, declining sales and legal liability.\nThe threats facing our customers are constantly evolving and the techniques used by experienced hackers to access or sabotage data change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we must constantly update our product solutions to respond to these threats. We produce complex solutions that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments. Software may contain defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations or introduce security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized use or data loss. There can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects prior to the product being introduced, which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services. The product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect or mitigate vulnerabilities could be material to our operating results. Our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service from the market, a security breach, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, failure to achieve market acceptance, lost revenue and increased expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur transmission and storage of personally identifiable information, including the personal data of European data subjects and other confidential information, and the potential for inadvertent exposure of PII or CI, could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe transmit and store large amounts of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about individuals, which may include healthcare or financial information, and other confidential information (\u201cCI\u201d). Although we have established, and continue to develop and enhance, security measures and controls to help protect against unauthorized disclosure of such PII and other CI, an inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized third-party access to, PII or CI, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and subject us to claims or other liabilities.\nIn addition, our processing and storage of certain types of data is subject to confidentiality agreements with our clients and handling PII is increasingly subject to a variety of changing privacy and data security regulations around the world. For example, the collection and use of personal data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, were replaced with the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in May 2018. GDPR imposes several requirements relating to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data, such as requirements for using consent or other legal grounds to process personal data, providing information to individuals about how their personal data is used, maintaining adequate security and data protection measures, giving data breach notifications, complying with individuals\u2019 requests to access, correct or delete their personal data and using third-party processors of personal data. GDPR also maintains the European Union\u2019s strict rules limiting the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. GDPR will introduce substantial potential fines for violations and increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. To comply with the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional technical and administrative measures and controls mechanisms. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies including us to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. In the wake of that decision, we decided to participate in the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and opened for participation on August 1, 2016. We applied for and were approved for certification and are now an Active Participant in the Privacy Shield program. Our Privacy Shield self-certification was finalized by the Department of Commerce and became effective as of November 9, 2016 and was renewed in November 2017. This allows us to transfer personal data of European data subjects that we receive from customers to the United States, in compliance with the Privacy Shield principles. While our Privacy Shield certification and other mechanisms (such as Model Clauses) to lawfully transfer such data remain in place, those mechanisms are also subject to pending legal challenges and these legal challenges may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data. Future changes in requirements under these regulations may be inconsistent with our existing data management practices. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business, including increased cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional costs and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and harm our business. Furthermore, any inadvertent disclosure of, or unauthorized access (including due to a cyber-attack) to, PII or other CI or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties, damages, remediation and other expenses, and damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nProblems with protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights to establish and protect intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in our products and services. These intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights might be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information may not prevent its misuse, theft or misappropriation. Competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology into their products. Competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology. Some jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology.\nWe may have to defend or assert our rights in intellectual property that we use in our products and services, and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could be disruptive and expensive to our business.\nWe may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. If we acquire technology to include in our products and services from third parties, our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology. Also, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, including initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or misappropriation. Intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive, whether or not resolved in our favor. Even unmeritorious claims brought against us or our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships, may cause us to incur significant legal and other fees to defend, and may have to be settled for significant amounts. Infringement claims against us could require us to develop non-infringing products and services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements. Our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop non-infringing technology or license technology on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may face risks from using \u201copen source\u201d software that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nLike many other software companies, we use \u201copen source\u201d software in order to take advantage of common industry building blocks and to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively. Open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software. Depending upon how the open source software is deployed, we could be required to offer products that use the open source software for no cost, or make available the source code for modifications or derivative works. Any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software. Using open source code could also cause us to inadvertently infringe third-party intellectual property rights or require us to publicly disclose proprietary information. We have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns, but we cannot be sure that our process or controls will be sufficient to mitigate all risk in this regard. Open source software might also introduce security vulnerabilities or defective functionality. The open source community may not always respond with adequate urgency to mitigate the impacts of such defects.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party intellectual property, which may not be accessible to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nSome of our products include third-party intellectual property, which may require licenses for our use. For example, a significant portion of the revenue generated by our Erado business is dependent on the licensing of certain electronic message API\u2019s, such as those made available by LinkedIn Corporation, SMS providers, Facebook, and other social media channels, and a significant portion of the revenue generated by our AppRiver business is dependent on the licensing of Microsoft products such as Office 365. Based on past experience and industry practice, we believe that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses for new or current products on acceptable terms or at all. Changes in the terms of such licenses may decrease our product margins and our failure to obtain or maintain such licenses may limit our ability to sell our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe may fail to recruit and retain key personnel, which could impair our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business. It could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace key personnel. Integrating new key personnel may be difficult and costly. Volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives. Any of these impairments related to our key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nGovernmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non-U.S. markets could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nExports of software solutions and services using encryption technology such as ours are generally restricted by the U.S. government. Although we have obtained U.S. government approval to export our service to almost all countries, the list of countries to which we (and our distributors) cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future. In addition, some countries impose restrictions on the importation and use of encryption solutions and services such as ours. The cost of compliance with U.S. and other export laws, or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non-U.S. markets, could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion. We face a variety of other legal and compliance risks. If we or our distributors fail to comply with applicable law and regulations, we may become subject to penalties, fines or restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to U.S. federal, state and local governmental agency customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in past periods, and we may in the future increase sales to government agencies. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government contractual requirements often carry a high compliance risk. Government certification requirements for solutions like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities also may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness, Capital Structure and Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nIn February 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto under which we established (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $175 million, (ii) a senior secured delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $10 million and (iii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Zix. The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all assets of Zix and the guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Credit Facilities will mature in February of 2024. The incurrence of this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, stock buybacks and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic, financial market or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlengthening or otherwise adversely affecting our sales process as customers evaluate our financial viability.\nOptional prepayments of borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be permitted at any time, without premium (other than customary LIBOR breakage costs). We must prepay the term loan facility in equal quarterly installments of $437,500 on the last day of each March, June, September and December (commencing on June 30, 2019) until maturity in February of 2024. In addition to other customary mandatory prepayment requirements, the term loan facility requires annual prepayments based on a percentage of Zix\u2019s excess cash flow, which percentage will reduce as Zix\u2019s total net leverage ratio decreases. We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. To a significant extent, our ability to do so is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition and ability to expand our business may be adversely affected.\nThe interest rate borne by our Credit Facilities will float over time and is initially LIBOR plus 3.50%, with future step downs in the interest rate margin as our total net leverage reduces. The floating rate nature of this interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk. Changes in economic conditions outside of our control could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing our interest expense even though the amount borrowed remains the same.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit agreement may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nThe credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. The financial covenant requires Zix to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) and is tested on a quarterly basis (commencing March 31, 2019), based on the rolling four-quarter period that ends on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The non-financial covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, incur liens, merge with or acquire other entities, make investments, dispose of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, make dividends, distributions or stock repurchases, prepay junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements, and amend our organizational documents or the terms of junior indebtedness.\nThese restrictions may make it more difficult or discourage a takeover of Zix, whether favored or opposed by our management and/or our Board of Directors.\nOur ability to comply with some of these restrictive covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to do so. Failure to comply could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing, or to reduce expenditures. We cannot guarantee that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nUpon the occurrence of a default, or if we are unable to make the representations and warranties in the credit agreement governing our Credit Facilities, we will not be able to borrow funds or issue letters of credit under our Credit Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay that amount, our lenders could seize our assets securing the loans and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) and investment agreement restrict our ability to incur certain indebtedness which limits our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn February 2019, we issued Series A Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries A Certificate of Designations\u201d) and Series B Preferred Stock established by a Certificate of Designations (the \u201cSeries B Certificate of Designations\u201d), which contain covenants that, among other things, require the consent of the holders of a majority of each of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock before we can incur indebtedness in excess of a specified leverage ratio.\nIn January 2019, we entered into an investment agreement with an investment fund managed by True Wind Capital (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), which contains customary covenants, including among others, that for so long as any shares of preferred stock issued pursuant to the investment agreement are outstanding, the consent of the Investor will be necessary for us to issue, subject to certain exceptions, any debt securities convertible into any of our capital stock.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available.\nWe may require additional financing in the future to operate or expand our business, acquire assets or repay or refinance our existing debt. Our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our business development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, as well as other factors beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Additionally, under the terms of our credit agreement, preferred stock and investment agreement, respectively, we are restricted from incurring additional debt, subject to certain exceptions. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock or preferred stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;\n\u2022\nrepay or refinance our existing debt;\n\u2022\nacquire complementary technologies, solutions or businesses;\n\u2022\nexpand operations, in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressure or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could seriously impact our business, negatively affecting financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be able to incur more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness.\nDespite our current indebtedness level, we may be able to incur more indebtedness in the future. We are not completely prohibited under the terms of the credit agreement, preferred stock, investment agreement or other agreements governing our current indebtedness from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions, any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness. If new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur preferred stockholders can exercise significant control over the Company, which could limit the ability of our common stockholders to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nThe Investor holds approximately 16.6% of our outstanding voting capital stock based on the number of shares of common stock and convertible Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 6, 2019, on an as-converted basis. If Stockholder Approval (as defined in the investment agreement) is obtained, the Investor will have an aggregate voting power of at least 24.2% of our outstanding capital stock on the date of such Stockholder Approval, which amount may increase based on the accrued value of the Series B Preferred Stock at conversion. In addition, the Investor\u2019s aggregate voting power will increase further in connection with future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock for as long as the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote their shares, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. As a result, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. The Investor is entitled to act separately in its own respective interests with respect to its ownership interests in the Company and has the ability to substantially influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors, thereby potentially controlling our management and affairs. In addition, the Investor has significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.\nAdditionally, holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are required to approve certain matters as a class, voting separately from the common stock, such as (1) any amendment, alteration or repeal to our Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) or the Series A Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series A Preferred Stock; (2) any amendment or alteration to our Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue any parity stock or senior stock as to dividend or liquidation rights; (3) the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock other than in connection with the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock that\nwas issued on the Issue Date; (4) any action that would cause us to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (5) the incurrence of indebtedness that would cause us to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nFurther, holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, are required to approve certain matters as a class, voting separately from the common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock, such as (1) any amendment, alteration or repeal to our Articles of Incorporation or the Series B Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or power of the Series B Preferred Stock; (2) any amendment or alteration to our Articles of Incorporation or any other action to authorize or create, or increase the number of authorized or issued shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, or reclassify any security into, or issue any parity stock or senior stock as to dividend or liquidation rights; (3) the issuance of any additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock; (4) any action that would cause us to cease to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (5) the incurrence of indebtedness that would cause us to exceed a specified leverage ratio.\nAny issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock upon automatic conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the Stockholder Approval will cause dilution to existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has an initial stated value of $1,000 per share, which stated value will accrete at an annual rate of 8% per annum, compounded quarterly. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into (i) the number of shares of common stock equal to the product of (A) the stated value per share as it has accreted as of such date multiplied by (B) the Conversion Rate as of the applicable conversion date divided by (C) 1,000 plus (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares. The initial Conversion Rate is equal to 166.11 shares of our common stock and is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain customary events in accordance with the terms of the Series A Certificate of Designations. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to participate in dividends paid in respect of the common stock on an as-converted basis.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock (including any shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued upon automatic conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the Stockholder Approval) will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of our common stock holders, and such dilution will increase over time in connection with the future accretion of the Series A Preferred Stock and the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into Series A Preferred Stock (assuming Stockholder Approval is obtained).\nTexas law and our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions, that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Texas Business Organizations Code, as amended (\u201cTBOC\u201d), and our Articles of Incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions regarding:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer, and pursuant to which we have issued the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, each of which are entitled to receive a liquidation preference and certain amounts in connection with a change of control of the company and other similar extraordinary transactions;\n\u2022\nthe limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that directors may only be removed from our Board of Directors by the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose at which quorum is present;\n\u2022\na prohibition on common stockholder action by written consent, which forces common stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a stockholder proposal or to take other action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors or a holder of at least 10% of all of the shares of the Company entitled to vote at the proposed special meeting, and must be called by our president or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the members of\nour Board of Directors, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions enabling us to control the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board of Directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of all issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors at a properly called and convened annual or special meeting of shareholders, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or our bylaws, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our Board of Directors or management.\nIn addition, as a Texas corporation, we are subject to provisions of Texas law, including Section 21.606 of the TBOC, which may prohibit certain stockholders holding 20% or more of our outstanding capital stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us for a specified period of time.\nAny provision of Texas law or our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOther Risks Related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock\nFuture resales of our common stock held by our significant stockholders or of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversation of the Series A Preferred Stock may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nWe are obligated to register the resale of the common stock issuable upon conversion of, or issued as dividends upon, the Series A Preferred Stock, and to take certain actions to facilitate the transfer and sale of such shares. Upon such registration, shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock are converted would be freely tradable. The common stock issuable upon conversion may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company\u2019s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens, the price of the company\u2019s stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market, or the perception that such sales might occur, will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb converted shares sold by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nAny sale of large amounts of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the price of our common stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders, together with holders of our Series B Preferred Stock and before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock (including our common stock), in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 plus all accreted but unpaid\ndividends and (ii) the amount such holder would have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Stock had converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation.\nIn the event of our liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets generally available for distribution to our equity holders, together with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock (including our common stock), in an amount equal to $1,000 plus all accrued but unpaid dividends.\nIn addition, the $1,000 stated value per share of our Series A Preferred Stock will accrete at a fixed rate of 8.0% per annum, compounded quarterly. The holders Series A Preferred Stock are also entitled to receive any dividends paid in respect of our common stock on an as-converted basis. The holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends accruing daily on a cumulative basis payable quarterly in arrears in cash at a fixed rate of 10.0% per annum on the $1,000 stated value per share (the \u201cDividend Rate\u201d), which rate will automatically increase by 1.0% every six months that the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding and unconverted (subject to a cap of 12.0%). If cash dividends are not paid in respect of any dividend payment period, the liquidation preference of each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically increase at the Dividend Rate.\nFurther, the Series A Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable upon a change of control (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designations), at a price per share of Series A Preferred Stock in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series A Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined below) and (ii) (A) the amount of cash such holder of Series A Preferred Stock would have received plus (B) the fair market value of any other assets such holder would have received, in each case had such holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, immediately prior to such change of control, converted such shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock. The \u201cSeries A Change of Control Redemption Price\u201d per share of Series A Preferred Stock is the product of the accreted value of such share as of the date of determination multiplied by (1) 1.30 (if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of the date of issuance); (2) 1.35 (if the change of control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the date of issuance but before the second anniversary of the date of issuance); (3) 1.40 (if the change of control occurs on or after the second anniversary of the date of issuance but before the third anniversary of the date of issuance); (4) 1.45 (if the change of control occurs on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance but before the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance); and (5) 1.50 (if the change of control occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance).\nFurther, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock also have redemption rights upon the occurrence of certain events. Specifically, the Series B Preferred Stock is mandatorily redeemable, upon the holder\u2019s election and after 90 days prior notice, any time after the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance at an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed as of the applicable redemption date multiplied by 1.50. The Series B Preferred Stock is also mandatorily redeemable upon a change of control (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations), at a price per share of Series B Preferred Stock in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series B Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined below) and (ii) (A) the amount of cash such holder of Series B Preferred Stock would have received plus (B) the fair market value of any other assets in each case had such holder of Series B Preferred Stock, immediately prior to such change of control, converted such shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The \u201cSeries B Change of Control Redemption Price\u201d per share of Series B Preferred Stock is the product of the liquidation preference of such share as of the date of determination multiplied by (1) 1.30 (if the change of control occurs before the first anniversary of the date of issuance); (2) 1.35 (if the change of control occurs on or after the first anniversary of the date of issuance but before the second anniversary of the date of issuance); (3) 1.40 (if the change of control occurs on or after the second anniversary of the date of issuance but before the third anniversary of the date of issuance); (4) 1.45 (if the change of control occurs on or after the third anniversary of the date of issuance but before the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance); and (5) 1.50 (if the change of control occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance).\nFinally, any time after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, we have the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock for cash at a redemption price equal to the accreted value per share of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed multiplied by 1.50. Likewise, at any time after the fourth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, we have the right to redeem the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share of the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed multiplied by 1.50.\nThese dividend and redemption payment obligations could significantly impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of our cash flows that are available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights described above could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75853, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ZIXI"}
