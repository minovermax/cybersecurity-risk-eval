{"cik": "887359", "company": "Vericel Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and trading price of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not known to us or that we do not consider to be material at this time. If the events described in these risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would likely suffer. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe current and ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could seriously harm our research, development and commercialization efforts, increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research, development and commercialization activities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economy and has contributed, at times, to significant volatility in financial markets. The global impact of the pandemic has fluctuated since early 2020. At times, many state, local and national governments - including those in Massachusetts and Michigan, where our operations are located - have responded by issuing, extending and supplementing orders requiring quarantines, restrictions on travel, and the mandatory closure of certain non-essential businesses, among other actions. In the U.S., the status and application of these orders have varied on a state-by-state basis since the early days of the pandemic. Many of the restrictions have been periodically updated as infection rates in the U.S. have risen and fallen, as new virus variants have emerged, as vaccines have been distributed and administered, and as world health leaders learn more about the virus, its transmission pathway and who is most at risk. Because Vericel is deemed an essential business, we have been exempted from government orders requiring the closure of workplaces and the cessation of business operations as they have existed from time-to-time during the pandemic.\nEven though widespread distribution of vaccines designed to protect against COVID-19 infection began in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world in early 2021, the pandemic remains unpredictable, and the number of COVID-19 infections has fluctuated significantly in various geographies during 2020 and throughout 2021 and could continue to do so, particularly in light of emerging variant strains. As such, some state and local governments have re-instituted restrictions on businesses, travel, and personal activities from time-to-time and additional such measures may occur in the future as the pandemic evolves.\nAt the outset of the pandemic, we put in place a comprehensive workplace protection plan, which instituted protective measures in response to COVID-19. At all times, our workplace protection plan has closely followed guidance issued by the CDC and has complied with applicable federal and state law. We have continued to regularly review our policies and procedures as the pandemic has evolved and will continue to do so - balancing the need to protect our workforce, customers\nand partners from COVID-19 infection with the need to continue optimal business operations and the delivery of MACI and Epicel to the patients we serve. Future actions that we take may result in disruption to our business.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious disease, impacts our preclinical studies, clinical trial operations and current or future commercialization efforts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of such pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The rapid development and uncertainty of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and it may have the effect of heightening many of the risks described herein, including the below.\n\u2022Hospitals, health systems and surgeons minimized, postponed, or canceled electively scheduled surgeries during the initial wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. These actions were followed by numerous state-level executive orders either restricting or partially restricting elective surgeries. Because MACI is an elective surgical procedure, as a result of these restrictions we experienced a significant increase in cancellations of scheduled MACI procedures as well as a slowdown in new MACI orders during March and April of 2020, which negatively impacted our business and results of operations during the first and second quarters of 2020. The level and degree of restriction on elective surgeries, on the ability of patients to seek treatment and on U.S. business operations generally fluctuated throughout 2020 as COVID-19 infection rates rose and fell during the summer months and into the autumn. By the first quarter of 2021, the pandemic\u2019s effects on our MACI business had largely dissipated. During the summer of 2021, however, some patients postponed or delayed treatment with MACI in order to take vacation and/or travel following the lifting of COVID-19-related restrictions that had been in place in many parts of the country for more than a year. Additionally, the surge of new COVID-19 infections seen throughout the U.S. during the second half of 2021, resulting from the spread of the \u201cDelta\u201d and \u201cOmicron\u201d variants again caused disruptions to health care networks, the postponement or cessation of elective surgical procedures, like MACI, and overall patient behavior. These effects were compounded by staffing shortages at many healthcare facilities across the U.S. during the same period. Consequently, and notwithstanding the widespread distribution of vaccines in the U.S., these factors contributed to a slowdown of MACI procedures during the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The risk remains that regional or local restrictions could again be placed on the performance of elective surgical procedures if the number of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. were to continue to rise, or if new or existing COVID-19 variants render current vaccine treatments ineffective. We believe our MACI business will be negatively impacted if elective surgical procedures are again materially restricted. Further, renewed and material disruption to the operations of our employees, distributors, suppliers or customers will impact our sales and operating results and could lead to potential impairments to inventory and accounts receivable. Although Epicel has been less directly impacted by the pandemic given the critical nature of severe burn injuries, it is difficult to ascertain the current or future impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of severe burns.\n\u2022We continue to manufacture MACI and Epicel and we maintain a significant safety back-up of all key raw materials. We do not currently expect that supply chain interruptions will impact our ongoing manufacturing operations. However, we currently rely on both domestic and international third parties to, among other things, manufacture and supply raw materials, which are used to produce our products, and supply other goods and services to run our business. If any such third parties in our supply chain are adversely impacted by current or future restrictions or executive orders resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for an extended period of time, including staffing shortages, production slowdowns, disruptions in delivery systems, or federal, state or foreign orders requiring the diversion of key supplies for use in the production or manufacturing of vaccines designed to inoculate individuals against COVID-19, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture our products and product candidates and conduct our research and development operations, or commercially launch any of our product candidates, if approved. With respect to customer delivery, MACI final product has an established shelf life of six (6) days and established shipping shelf life of three (3) days. Currently, MACI is picked-up by courier and shipped by commercial air or ground transportation to our customers\u2019 locations. Epicel final product has an established shelf life of 24 hours and is hand carried to customer hospital sites by courier. Transportation is primarily by commercial or charter airline. Although we have not experienced material shipping delays or increased costs to date, significant disruption of air travel in the future could result in the inability to deliver MACI or Epicel final products to customer sites within appropriate timeframes, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022The documented and ongoing world-wide supply chain disruptions may adversely impact our ability or the ability of others, including hospitals, to utilize MACI or Epicel.\n\u2022As public health data warranted, at various times during the pandemic we restricted on-site staff in our facilities to only those personnel and contractors who are required to perform essential activities related to the manufacture, production and delivery of our products. During these periods, we encouraged the majority of our remaining employees to work remotely. To date, we have been successful in sustaining our operations and providing MACI and Epicel to patients in need. We continue to review our policies and procedures regularly, including our workplace protection plan, as the pandemic evolves and we may take additional actions to the extent required. We expect that some of our employees will continue to work remotely from time to time. A resurgence of COVID-19, COVID-19 variants, or similar infectious diseases in the U.S., however, may lead to future government-imposed quarantines and restrictions, which may result in the closure of our administrative offices, with our employees working outside of our offices for an extended period of time. These actions may also result in the disruption of our manufacturing operations, which are currently accomplished within our administrative offices. Additionally, such quarantines and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to conduct certain product enhancement and business development activities.\n\u2022Our partial reliance on certain personnel working from home may also increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, institutional review boards and ethics committees, third-party contractors and suppliers, clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors. Our business operations may be further disrupted if any of our employees, officers or directors contract an illness related to COVID-19 and are unable to perform their duties. For example, COVID-19 illness could impact members of management or our board of directors resulting in absenteeism from management meetings or meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult for management to effectively oversee our daily operations, or to convene the quorums of the full board of directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs. A resurgence of COVID-19 or COVID-19 variants may cause our employees, and employees of third-party contractors and licensees, including MediWound, responsible for conducting research and development activities to be unable to access laboratories and places of business for an extended period of time as a result of the temporary closure of such workspaces. As a result, this could delay timely completion of ongoing clinical trials or preclinical activities, and our ability to select future development candidates.\n\u2022NexoBrid is currently a pre-commercial product in North America. On June 29, 2021, we announced that MediWound had received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the BLA and the agency communicated to MediWound that it had completed its review of the BLA, as amended, and had determined that it cannot approve the BLA in its present form. We announced further that we are working with MediWound and the FDA to address the issues identified by the FDA to seek potential approval of NexoBrid. Health regulatory agencies, including the FDA, have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the continued spread or resurgence of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the FDA\u2019s response times to regulatory submissions, like a BLA resubmission in response to the complete response letter, and its ability to monitor our clinical trials. Additionally, in many instances across the industry, the FDA has postponed, or has been unable to conduct certain inspections of domestic and international manufacturing facilities in connection with its regulatory review of product applications as a result of travel and other restrictions caused by the pandemic. As part of its review of the BLA, and any BLA resubmission, the FDA has communicated to MediWound that physical cGMP inspections of manufacturing facilities in Israel and Taiwan are required before the BLA can be approved, as the FDA must assess the ability of those facilities to conduct certain manufacturing operations in compliance with cGMP. The FDA indicated that because of restrictions on travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency was unable to conduct the required inspections of those facilities during the original BLA review cycle. Should continued restrictions prevent or delay the FDA in conducting necessary reviews or physical inspections of the manufacturing facilities involved in the production of NexoBrid, or should other events impact the FDA\u2019s response times, the timeline for approval of NexoBrid could be materially and further delayed, which could materially affect the development, study and ultimate commercialization of the product.\n\u2022The trading prices of our common stock and that of other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\n\u2022The negative economic effects of the pandemic have, at times, caused increased unemployment in the U.S. resulting in many individuals losing their employer-based insurance coverage. The continued or future unemployment of our potential patients may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, market disruption or rising unemployment caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or a variant strain thereof may lead to delays in obtaining insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products as well as an increase in the numbers of uninsured patients and patients who may no longer be able to afford their co-insurance or co-pay obligations. These factors may lead to decreased utilization of our products, which could reduce revenue. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively impact our commercialization strategy for our products and product candidates, if approved. At times during the pandemic, hospitals and other medical institutions have reduced and diverted staffing, diverted resources to patients suffering from COVID-19 and limited hospital access for non-patients, which has included our sales personnel. Hospitals may continue or increase these and similar measures in the future should the COVID-19 virus and any future variants continue to spread or surge in certain areas. In addition, COVID-19 levels in the U.S. and/or specific regions of the U.S. may cause customers or patients to postpone or cancel previously scheduled surgeries or to decline to schedule surgeries utilizing our products, which would negatively impact our operations and financial results. Although many face-to-face interactions have resumed, our sales personnel, at times, have conducted, and may continue to have to conduct, many of their interactions with physicians and patients through the use of webinars, telemedicine, direct-to-consumer advertising and social media. These circumstances may adversely affect the ability of our sales professionals to effectively market our products to physicians in the future, which may have a negative impact on our potential sales and our market penetration.\nIf any of these risks related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were to occur, our preclinical activities, clinical development progress, data and timelines, commercialization efforts including any potential revenue from sales, supply chain continuity, and general business operations could be delayed and/or materially harmed and our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations would suffer as a result. The extent to which the current pandemic, or a future pandemic, impacts our business and operations will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and governmental actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as investors and research analysts respond to quarterly fluctuations. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nFactors that may affect our results of operations include:\n\u2022the timing of new orders and revenue recognition for new and prior year orders\u037e\n\u2022seasonal buying patterns of our customers\u037e\n\u2022volatility in the sales of our products;\n\u2022volume of revenues;\n\u2022competitive developments;\n\u2022changes in third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products;\n\u2022our ability to supply and meet customer demand for our products;\n\u2022our ability to increase sales to our existing customers, particularly larger customers\u037e\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers\u037e\n\u2022our ability to develop and achieve market adoption of our products\u037e\n\u2022the impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business;\n\u2022the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease;\n\u2022erosion in margins or significant fluctuations in revenues caused by changing customer demand\u037e\n\u2022the timing and cost of hiring personnel and of large expenses such as third-party professional services\u037e\n\u2022stock-based compensation expenses, which vary along with changes to our stock price\u037e\n\u2022supply chain disruptions or constraints;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\u037e and\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting rules or our accounting policies.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues and profits, if any, achieved by us in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. For example, the rate at which MACI biopsies convert to implants has generally been consistent since the product was first commercially launched in 2017, although the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic effected this conversion rate at times during 2021. We cannot be certain that this rate will remain constant in the future, and if this rate were to decline, our revenue growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations as to future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues. If we fail to achieve our quarterly forecasts, if our forecasts fall below the expectations of investors or research analysts, or if our actual results fail to meet the expectations of investors or research analysts, our stock price may decline.\nSeasonal sales patterns and other variations related to our revenue recognition may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nHistorically, and specifically prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had significant seasonal patterns in product orders with the highest volume occurring in the fourth quarter and the lowest volume occurring in the first quarter. As a result, a significantly higher percentage of our annual revenues have historically been recognized in the fourth quarter and the lowest percentage of annual revenues in the first quarter of a given calendar year. This is due to a number of factors, including insurance deductible limits and the time of year during which patients prefer to start rehabilitation. We expect to continue to experience this seasonality of our business in subsequent years after the COVID-19 pandemic and its related implications have ended.\nOur quarterly growth in revenues also may not align with new orders that we receive in a given quarter, which could mask the impact of seasonal variations. This mismatch can be due to the timing of revenue recognition.\nSeasonal and other variations related to our revenue recognition may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows, may make it challenging for an investor to predict our performance on a quarterly basis and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results will be harmed if we are unable to effectively manage and sustain our future growth or scale our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our future growth efficiently or profitably. Our business remains unproven at a large-scale operational level and actual revenue and operating margins, or revenue and margin growth, may be less than expected. If we are unable to scale our production capabilities efficiently or maintain pricing without significant discounting, we may fail to achieve expected operating margins, which would have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. For example, we are planning to move to a larger facility to support our potential growth, but if the construction and customization of such facility is delayed, we may be limited in our ability to meet future demand for our products. Growth may also stress our ability to adequately manage our operations, quality of products, safety and regulatory compliance. If growth significantly decreases it will negatively impact our cash reserves, and we may be required to obtain additional financing, which may increase indebtedness or result in dilution to shareholders. Further, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we do not manage inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMany factors affect the efficient use and planning of inventory of certain components and other materials used in our cell manufacturing process to manufacture our marketed products, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, efficiently meeting product demand requirements and expiration of materials in inventory. We may be unable to manage our inventory efficiently, keep inventory within expected budget goals, keep inventory on hand or manage it efficiently, control expired inventory or keep sufficient inventory of materials to meet product demand due to our dependence on third-party suppliers. Finally, we cannot provide assurances that we can keep inventory costs within our target levels. Failure to do so may harm our long-term growth prospects.\nWe have incurred losses and may not achieve consistent profitability for some time or at all.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 we reported net loss of $7.5 million. Prior to that, with the exception of the year ended December 31, 2020, when we reported net income of $2.9 million, we had incurred net losses each year since our inception in 1989. As of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated a deficit of approximately $383.3 million and $129.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Based on our current plan and existing cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand we are positioned to sustain current operations through at least 12 months following the issuance of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough we believe we can continue to achieve profitability without the need to raise additional capital, we may incur significant operating losses over the next several years despite sales increasing and margins improving, due to continuing expenses related to research and development, and the expense associated with continuing the commercialization of our approved products. We cannot predict with any certainty the existence or amount of future losses. Our ability to maintain profitability will depend on, among other things, increasing sales of our current products, improving gross margins, successfully commercializing new products, completing the development of our future product candidates, timely initiation and completion of clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing manufacturing, sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, maintaining supplies of key manufacturing components and the possible acquisition and development of additional and complementary products. Therefore, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn the longer term, we may need to raise additional funds in order to continue to complete product development programs and the clinical trials needed to obtain approval for and commercialize our future product candidates, or to capitalize on potential strategic opportunities. We cannot be certain that actual results will not differ materially from our current projections and that current capital will be sufficient to achieve profitability or that funding will be available on favorable terms, if at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u2022The ability to maintain our manufacturing facility\u2019s compliance with FDA requirements, including establishment and product fees;\n\u2022The requirements necessary to maintain in good standing marketing authorizations and licenses from regulatory bodies in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022The liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities;\n\u2022Regulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties;\n\u2022Anticipating technological developments by competitors;\n\u2022The rate and degree of progress of our product development; and\n\u2022The rate and cadence of the regulatory approvals needed to proceed with clinical development programs.\nOur products and product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky, which may decrease the chances of regulatory approval and could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur products are subject to the inherent risks of failure associated with the development of new products based on novel technologies. The innovative nature of our therapeutics creates significant challenges with regard to product development and optimization, manufacturing, regulatory environment and emerging regulations, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. Therapeutic advancements are generally ahead of development and release of regulatory guidance and requirements. The lack of established precedents and evolving regulatory policy for novel products can pose significant challenges in product and clinical development, which can decrease the chances of regulatory success.\nOur products represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept. Furthermore, the success of our products is dependent on wider acceptance by the medical community.\nWhile our products have had some commercial success to date, the broader market may not understand or accept our products. Our products represent new treatments or therapies and compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others. The nature of our products creates significant challenges with regard to product development and optimization, manufacturing, regulations, and third-party reimbursement. As a result, the commercialization of our current products and the development pathway for our potential new products may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathway for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our marketed or potential new products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022The clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their demonstrated advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022Our ability to demonstrate to healthcare providers that our products provide a therapeutic advancement over standard of care treatment or other competitive products and methods;\n\u2022Our ability to educate healthcare providers on the autologous use of human tissue, to avoid potential confusion with, and differentiate ourselves from, the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue and engineered human tissue;\n\u2022Our ability to educate healthcare providers, patients and payers on the safety and adverse reactions involving our products;\n\u2022Our ability to meet supply and demand and develop a group of medical professionals familiar with and committed to the use of our products; and\n\u2022The cost-effectiveness of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nIf the medical community or patients do not accept the safety and effectiveness of our products, it could negatively affect our ability to sell those products, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operations.\nFailure to enter into written agreements with payers for reimbursement of our products and to obtain adequate reimbursement and reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have a limited network of specialty pharmacy distributors for MACI, and we primarily rely on our specialty pharmacy distributors\u2019 contracts with third-party payers for reimbursement. Under our distribution agreements with Orsini and AllCare, we assume the credit and collection risk of third-party payers, as Orsini and AllCare dispense MACI and perform the collection activities. We also sell a portion of MACI implants directly to facilities based on prices stated in an approved contract or an applicable purchase order with the facility. Often the contracted rates are tied to the facility\u2019s third-party reimbursement from an underlying insurance provider. We sell Epicel directly to hospitals based on contracted rates stated in an approved contract or an applicable purchase order with the hospital.\nFailing to maintain and obtain written agreements from payers for reimbursement of our products or to obtain adequate reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, healthcare providers are under pressure to increase profitability and reduce costs. We cannot predict the extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by initiatives to reduce costs for healthcare providers. Failure to collect from such payers or to obtain or maintain written agreements with such payers or obtaining lower than estimated reimbursement for our products would adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nA cyber security incident could result in a loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection and privacy laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe collect and store sensitive information, including intellectual property and personally identifiable information, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect this confidential data through technology, processes, and our people. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely reviewed by internal and external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced and increased attacks against our and our third-party service providers\u2019 or partners\u2019 information systems create risk of cyber security incidents. Potential attacks could include use of harmful malware or ransomware, and our information technology systems could be compromised by outside parties intent on extracting ransom or information, corrupting data or disrupting business practices. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cyber security incidents that evade our security measures, result in the loss of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems and business. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber security vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss, access, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of data, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws\nor litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nIn addition, regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, in 2016, the EU adopted a new regulation governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in.\nWe rely on complex information technology systems for various critical purposes, including timely delivery of products and maintaining patient confidentiality. If these systems fail or are disrupted, we could lose product sales and our revenue and reputation would suffer.\nWe have developed comprehensive, integrated information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for the intake of physician orders for our products, to track product delivery, and to store patient-related data that we obtain for purposes of manufacturing MACI and Epicel. We rely on these systems to maintain the chain of identity for each autologous product, and to ensure timely delivery of product, prior to expiration. Each of our products has a limited usable life measured in days from the completion of the manufacturing process to patient implant or grafting. Accordingly, maintaining accurate scheduling logistics is critical. In addition, these IT systems store and protect the privacy of certain patient information, which is required for the manufacture of our individualized cell therapy products. We have also developed an integrated information technology system for benefit coordination for MACI patients who have opted-in to the My Cartilage Care program, which we use with our benefit coordination contractor and our contracted specialty pharmacies. This system contains patient-related information some of which is accessible by company personnel and healthcare professionals for surgery coordination activities. If any of our systems were to fail or be disrupted for an extended period of time, we could lose product sales and our revenue and reputation would suffer. Similarly, in the event our systems were to be breached by an unauthorized third-party, that party could potentially access the aforementioned patient information, which could cause us to suffer further reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nOur inability to complete our product development activities successfully would materially limit our ability to operate or finance our operations.\nIn order to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize future product candidates in the U.S., we must conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those products, in compliance with current regulatory requirements. We may not be able to successfully complete the development of future product candidates, or successfully market our technologies or future product candidates. We, and any of our potential collaborators, may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval and intellectual property rights of relevant technologies and future product candidates. Our research and development programs may not be successful, or our cell therapy technologies and future product candidates may not facilitate the production of cells outside the human body with the expected results. Additionally, our technologies and future product candidates may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials, and we may not obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates. If any of these events occur, our future prospects may be adversely impacted.\nWe must successfully complete nonclinical and clinical development to be able to demonstrate safety and efficacy to seek marketing approval of our current or future product candidates. Lack of efficacy and or safety events can lead to the discontinuation of clinical development, and this can occur at any stage of the clinical development program. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during development that can delay or prevent commercialization of our future development candidates.\nThe results of early stage clinical trials do not ensure success in later clinical trials, and interim results are not necessarily predictive of final results. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nAdditionally, several of our ongoing clinical trials utilize an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design. An \u201copen-label\u201d clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a \u201cpatient bias\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an \u201cinvestigator bias\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our product candidates for which we include an open-label clinical trial when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control.\nOur planned clinical trials may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Typically, if a biological product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.\nWith respect to any clinical trials affecting our approved products or future development candidates, failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable trials on a timely basis;\n\u2022Delays in obtaining IRB and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022Slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment in our clinical trials, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u2022Limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third-party payers for the use of biological products supplied for use in our clinical trials;\n\u2022Negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u2022Unforeseen adverse effects interrupting, delaying, or halting clinical trials of any future therapeutic product candidates, and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of any future therapeutic product candidates;\n\u2022Unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022Approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory requirements or guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u2022Inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u2022Inability to replicate in large controlled trials safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u2022Inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022Unavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nThe FDA, the IRBs, and the sponsor monitor the progress of clinical trials and they may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time because of concerns related to patient safety or for other considerations. The FDA may impose a clinical hold on our trials because of safety concerns that have arisen for products or product candidates that are similar to our product candidates. Even when successful clinical results are reported for a product from a completed clinical trial, the durability of response may not be sustained over time, or may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval.\nOur current product development activities include but are not limited to projects directed at expanding clinical indications, increasing the ease of use of our products for our customers, and decreasing the cost of manufacturing our products. These production process changes may alter the functionality of our cells and require various additional levels of experimental and clinical testing and evaluation. Any such testing could lengthen the time before these product enhancements would be commercially available.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct some of our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely or competent manner may delay development and/or impact commercialization, if approved, of our current and future product candidates.\nWe use clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials. We may face delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or competent fashion, or if we are forced to change service providers. Any third-party that we hire to conduct clinical trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our current and future product candidates could be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue would be delayed or prevented. In addition, we and any provider that we retain will be subject to GCP requirements. If GCP and other regulatory requirements are not adhered to by us or our third-party providers or clinical investigators, the conduct of the trial may be compromised and the development and commercialization of our current and future product candidates could be delayed or approval may never be obtained.\nAny failure by a CRO, a clinical trial site, or clinical investigator, or us to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and reporting, and data management and other services in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize the trial to obtain regulatory approval or complete clinical development of our product candidates to support regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO or a clinical trial site or clinical investigator may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate provider. However, making such changes may be costly and may delay our trials, could affect regulatory approval and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.\nWe face intense competition in the markets targeted by our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that all of our products will face intense competition from existing or future products, which may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nAll of our products face intense competition from existing and future products marketed by large companies. These competitors may successfully market products that compete with our products, identify and bring to market new product candidates earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective or less costly than our products. These competitive factors could require us to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets, which would be costly and time consuming. These activities can adversely impact our ability to effectively commercialize products and achieve revenue and profits.\nIf we do not keep pace with our competitors and with technological and market changes, our products will become less attractive or obsolete and our business may suffer.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological changes, and vary for different product candidates and processes that directly compete with our products. Our competitors in the medical and biotechnology industries may have superior products, research and development, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities, financial resources or marketing positions. Furthermore, our competitors may have developed, or could in the future develop, new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete.\nTo the extent that others develop new technologies that address the targeted application for our products, our business will suffer. Finally, if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies in a timely manner, the demand for our products may decrease or our products could become obsolete, and our revenue may decline or our growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nRestrictions on the use of animal-derived materials could harm our product development and commercialization efforts.\nSome of the manufacturing materials and/or components that we use in, and which are critical to, implementation of our technology involve the use of animal-derived products, including fetal bovine serum. Supplier changes or regulatory actions\nmay limit or restrict the availability of such materials for clinical and commercial use for a variety of reasons including contamination or perceived risk of contamination with an adventitious agent, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in one of our suppliers\u2019 herds. This may lead to a restricted supply of the serum currently required for our product manufacturing processes. Any restrictions on these materials would impose a potential competitive disadvantage for our products or prevent our ability to manufacture our cell products. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have issued regulations for controls over bovine material in animal feed. These regulations do not appear to affect our ability to purchase the manufacturing materials we currently use. However, regulatory agencies may introduce new regulations that could affect our operations. Our inability to develop or obtain alternative compounds would harm our product development and commercialization efforts. There are certain limitations in the supply of certain animal-derived materials, which may lead to delays in our ability to complete clinical trials or eventually to meet the anticipated market demand for our cell products.\nIf our licensing arrangement with MediWound is unsuccessful, our development of NexoBrid and its associated revenues may be limited.\nWe have entered into a licensing arrangement with MediWound for the development of NexoBrid in North America. However, there can be no assurance that this agreement and our and MediWound\u2019s efforts pursuant to it will result in FDA approval of NexoBrid, or that we will be able to market NexoBrid at a profit. Under the terms of the License Agreement, MediWound will continue to conduct all development activities under the supervision of a Central Steering Committee comprised of members of each party until the BLA is approved and subsequently transferred to Vericel. Collaboration and licensing arrangements pose many risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022collaborations and licensing arrangements may be terminated;\n\u2022collaborators and licensors may delay clinical trials and prolong clinical development, or under-fund or stop a clinical trial;\n\u2022expected revenue might not be generated because product candidates may not be approved;\n\u2022collaborators and licensors could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that could compete with our future products despite non-competition provisions;\n\u2022the terms of our contracts with current or future collaborators and license parties may not be favorable to us in the future;\n\u2022disputes may arise delaying or terminating the research, development, or commercialization of our product candidates, or result in significant and costly litigation or arbitration; and\n\u2022one or more third-party developers could obtain approval for a similar product prior to the product candidate resulting in unforeseen price competition in connection with the product candidate.\nProduct development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. If we are not able to successfully develop NexoBrid, there may be a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe intend to commercialize NexoBrid in the U.S. and potentially other North American countries. However, before we can commercialize NexoBrid, we must first obtain regulatory approval for the sale of NexoBrid in any jurisdiction, which includes the submission of an application utilizing completed and ongoing clinical studies to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective. We depend on MediWound for its efforts in completing clinical trials and other clinical activities pursuant to the development plan, obtaining regulatory approval and manufacturing and supplying NexoBrid.\nCertain events could delay or prevent our ability to successfully gain regulatory approval, including:\n\u2022patients may not participate in necessary follow-up visits to obtain required data, which would result in significant delays in the clinical testing process;\n\u2022an audit of MediWound\u2019s supply chain or manufacturing facilities and/or processes could reveal noncompliance or a regulatory agency requires further testing or inspections of such processes;\n\u2022third-party contractors, such as a research institute, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to MediWound;\n\u2022clinical or manufacturing-related data submitted to the FDA during BLA submission or re-submission may be found by the agency to be inadequate or incomplete;\n\u2022travel and other restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may limit or prohibit the FDA from conducting required CMC inspections of certain facilities involved in the production of NexoBrid, resulting in a delay of regulatory approval;\n\u2022undetected or concealed fraudulent activity by a clinical researcher, if discovered, could preclude the submission of clinical data prepared by that researcher, lead to the suspension or substantive scientific review of one or more of our\nmarketing applications by regulatory agencies, and result in the recall of any approved product distributed pursuant to data determined to be fraudulent; and\n\u2022an audit of preclinical or clinical studies by regulatory authorities may reveal noncompliance with applicable protocols or regulations, which could lead to disqualification of the results and the need to perform additional studies.\nA significant delay or a failure to receive regulatory approval for NexoBrid in the U.S. may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nNexoBrid\u2019s approval in the U.S. for the treatment of severe burns may be further delayed, or it may not be approved for use in the U.S. and other North American markets at all.\nOn September 16, 2020, we announced that the FDA had accepted for review MediWound\u2019s BLA seeking marketing approval for NexoBrid in the U.S. for the treatment of severe burns, and had assigned a PDUFA target date for the product of June 29, 2021. The BLA submission is based in large part on data derived from a U.S. Phase 3 pivotal study. MediWound is conducting twelve and twenty-four month safety follow-ups for cosmesis, function, quality of life and other safety measurements. Data from MediWound\u2019s twelve-month follow-up was submitted to FDA as part of the BLA submission. Data from the twenty-four month follow-up will be submitted to the agency as a safety update in connection with a BLA resubmission. While this and previous studies evaluating NexoBrid have met their primary endpoints, we cannot predict the outcome of the planned twenty-four month safety follow-ups or whether the FDA will approve the BLA based on the available preclinical and clinical data and the submitted manufacturing processes, and the cGMP data.\nOn June 29, 2021, we announced that MediWound received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the BLA for NexoBrid. The FDA communicated to MediWound that it had completed its review of the BLA, as amended, and had determined that it cannot approve the BLA in its present form. The FDA identified issues related to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC section of the BLA and had requested that MediWound provide additional CMC information. The FDA stated that it had not reviewed several amendments submitted by MediWound in response to the CMC information requests related to the BLA. The FDA also stated that inspections of manufacturing facilities in Israel and Taiwan are required before the BLA can be approved, but that it was unable to conduct the required inspections during the original review cycle due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions. In addition, the complete response letter referenced observations that were made during GCP inspections related to the DETECT study and requested that MediWound address questions regarding the impact of the observations on the study\u2019s efficacy findings. The FDA also requested that MediWound provide a safety update as part of a BLA resubmission.\nWhile we intend to work with MediWound and the FDA to address the issues identified in the complete response letter to seek the potential approval of NexoBrid, we cannot predict how long it will take for MediWound and/or us to respond to the communication. We also cannot predict whether the FDA will accept any such resubmission for review, and, if such resubmission is accepted for review, the length of time of any subsequent FDA review. We also cannot predict whether the FDA will ultimately approve the NexoBrid BLA. In addition, if approval to market NexoBrid is sought in Mexico or Canada, we cannot predict how long regulatory authorities in those countries will take to provide NexoBrid with marketing authorization in their jurisdictions or whether such authorizations will be granted at all. A significant delay or a failure to receive regulatory approval for NexoBrid in the U.S. may have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.\nThere is no guarantee that NexoBrid will be accepted in the market even if regulatory approval is received.\nThe success of NexoBrid, if and when approved, depends upon the acceptance of NexoBrid by patients, the medical community and third-party payers, effectively competing with other products, a continued acceptable safety profile following approval and qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending related intellectual property rights and claims. Even if we and MediWound successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market NexoBrid, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets that we are targeting are not as large as we estimate and/or if the acceptance and use of NexoBrid within those markets is not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nOur licensor, MediWound, is dependent on a contract with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to fund the Phase 3 clinical trial and other development activities of NexoBrid in the U.S. and these contracts may be terminated by BARDA at any time.\nMediWound has a contract with BARDA valued at up to $132.0 million for the advancement of the development and manufacturing, as well as the procurement, of NexoBrid in the U.S. Under the contract, BARDA has agreed to fund up to $56.0\nmillion of the development costs of NexoBrid required to obtain marketing approval in the U.S., including its ongoing pediatric Phase 3 study and its expansion to include U.S. pediatric burn care sites, and has an option to further fund $10.0 million in development activities for other potential NexoBrid indications. BARDA confirmed its previous commitment, began procuring NexoBrid in August and December of 2020 and confirmed additional deliveries will occur over the subsequent five quarters for emergency stockpile, as part of the HHS mission to build national preparedness for public health medical emergencies. The initial BARDA procurement is valued at $16.5 million. In addition, BARDA holds an option to procure additional quantities of NexoBrid through funding of up to $50.0 million. BARDA recently awarded MediWound a new contract to develop NexoBrid for the treatment of Sulfur Mustard injuries as part of BARDA\u2019s preparedness for mass casualty events. The contract provides approximately $12 million of funding to support research and development activities up to pivotal studies in animals under the U.S. FDA Animal Efficacy Rule and contains options for additional funding of up to $31.0 million for additional development activities, animal pivotal studies, and the BLA submission for licensure of NexoBrid for the treatment of Sulfur Mustard injuries. MediWound also was recently awarded funding for the NexoBrid expanded access treatment (\u201cNEXT\u201d) protocol being conducted under the FDA\u2019s expanded access program. However, the contracts provide that BARDA may terminate the contract at any time, at its convenience, without any further funding obligations. There can be no assurances that BARDA will not terminate the contract. Changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de-prioritized emphasis on supporting the development of products for the treatment of severe burns such as NexoBrid. Any reduction or delay in BARDA funding may result in a decrease in planned development activities, including the development of NexoBrid for the treatment of Sulfur Mustard injuries and the NEXT study. In addition, the loss of funding may adversely affect MediWound\u2019s ability to complete the required activities to comply with its obligations under the License Agreement. This could lead to a modification of the financial provisions of our agreement or a significant delay in the development of NexoBrid. Further, we cannot provide any assurances as to when or whether BARDA\u2019s commitment for procurement of NexoBrid will occur or when or whether BARDA\u2019s option to fund additional development activities for NexoBrid will be exercised.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing and Production of Our Products\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S. depend on one facility. If the facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could limit supply of our products or adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials and our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe presently conduct all of our commercial manufacturing operations in the U.S., at one facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, all of the commercial manufacturing for the U.S. market of our marketed products, MACI and Epicel, takes place at a single U.S. facility. If regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require us to discontinue production at the Cambridge facility, we will not be able to supply our products to our patients, which would adversely impact our business. If this facility, or some or all of the equipment in it, is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss, catastrophic incident, or similar event, we will not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity, and we may not be able to replace our facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of the facility or critical equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to a third-party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing from one facility to a third-party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with applicable regulatory and quality standard requirements whereby validation and FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be made commercially available. In addition, we do not currently have a fully automated manufacturing process, which could potentially introduce contaminants to the production process or other problems due to human error.\nWhile we do maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment, if we have underestimated our insurance needs, we will not have sufficient insurance to cover losses above and beyond the limits on our policies. Additionally, any supply interruption could harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer even after such supply interruption is corrected.\nFailure of third parties, including for example Matricel GmbH, to manufacture or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our MACI or Epicel cell manufacturing processes would impair our cell product development and commercialization.\nWe rely on third parties, including Matricel GmbH (\u201cMatricel\u201d) to manufacture and/or supply certain of our devices/manufacturing equipment and to manufacture and/or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our cell manufacturing process to manufacture our marketed cell therapy products and to develop our product candidates. In many instances these third parties serve as our sole suppliers. For example, Matricel is the sole supplier of the membrane for MACI. It would be difficult to obtain alternate sources of supply on a short-term basis due to the need for FDA approval of a new supplier. If any of our manufacturers or suppliers fails to perform its respective obligations, or if our supply\nof certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials is limited or interrupted, it could impair our ability to manufacture our products, which would delay our ability to market our commercial products or future product candidates or conduct clinical trials on a timely and cost-competitive basis, if at all.\nMany of our suppliers are sole or single source suppliers. We do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our third-party sole or single source suppliers of certain components and other materials used in our cell manufacturing process to manufacture our marketed cell therapy products. We purchase our required supply on a purchase order basis, and at any time the third-party suppliers could stop supplying our orders. FDA approval of a new supplier may be required if these materials become unavailable from our current suppliers. Although there may be other suppliers that have equivalent materials that would be available to us, FDA approval of any alternate suppliers, if required, could take several months or a year or more to obtain, if we could obtain such approval at all. Should we need to find alternate manufacturers or suppliers, we will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials, any delay in qualifying new materials, if necessary, or any delay associated with the transition to and verification of any new manufacturers or suppliers would prevent or delay our ability to manufacture products. In addition, a supplier\u2019s variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, or any other problem with our materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay our ability to manufacture products. These delays may limit our ability to meet demand for our products, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party suppliers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party suppliers, reliance on third-party suppliers entails additional risks, including the possible breach of the supply agreement by the third-party, and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third-party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nIn addition, we may not be able to continue our present arrangements with our suppliers, supplement existing relationships, establish and maintain new relationships or be able to identify and obtain the ancillary materials that are necessary to develop our product candidates in the future. Our dependence upon third parties for the supply and manufacture of these items could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver commercial and commercially feasible products on a timely and competitive basis.\nFailure by our third-party manufacturers, including Matricel, to comply with the regulatory requirements set forth by the FDA with respect to our products could limit our ability to manufacture commercial products.\nThird-party manufacturers, such as Matricel, are subject to inspection by the FDA for cGMP compliance, as well as for their ability to manufacture the components, products or product candidates in compliance with the established process and procedure for the product or product candidate during an inspection. We may compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and product candidates, if approved, and our financial performance may be materially affected.\nManufacturers of FDA-regulated products are obligated to operate in accordance with FDA-mandated requirements. A failure of any of our third-party manufacturers to establish and follow cGMP requirements and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials, may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our future product candidates, and may cause delays or interruptions in the availability of our products for commercial distribution. This could result in higher costs to us or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nComplying with cGMP, ICH and other non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product or product candidate meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection by the FDA for future product candidates, and are subject to routine FDA cGMP inspections. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on travel, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter. Further, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, the FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. Throughout the pandemic, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. Failure to address any FDA inspection observations in a timely manner, pass\npre-approval inspections or comply with cGMP requirements can result in delays to approvals for future product candidates and/or regulatory action that can limit the ability to manufacture commercial products. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products is characterized by inherent risks and challenges and has proven to be a costly endeavor relative to manufacturing other therapeutic products.\nThe manufacture of cell therapy products, such as our products and product candidates, is highly complex and is characterized by inherent risks and challenges such as biological raw material inconsistencies, logistical challenges, significant quality control and assurance requirements, manufacturing complexity, and significant manual processing. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy, such as most pharmaceuticals, cell therapy products are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. When manufacturing autologous cell therapies, the number and composition of the cell population varies from patient-to-patient, in part due to the age of the patient, since the therapy is dependent on patient-specific physiology. Such variability in the number and composition of these cells could adversely affect our ability to manufacture autologous cell therapies in a cost-effective manner and meet acceptable product release specifications for use in a clinical trial or, if approved, for commercial sale.\nDifficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risks associated with the manufacture of biologics by continuing to improve the characterization of all of our input materials, utilizing multiple vendors for supply of qualified biological materials when possible, and manufacturing some of these materials ourselves. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that the biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture cell therapy products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we or any third-party contractors with whom we enter into strategic relationships will be successful in streamlining manufacturing operations and implementing efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to meet and/or maintain the quality, price and production standards or production volumes necessary to achieve our growth and profitability objectives as projected, or at all. Additionally, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, three vaccines for COVID-19 have received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA and two of those later received marketing approval. Additional vaccines may be authorized or approved in the future. The recent demand for vaccines designed to protect against COVID-19 infection and the potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing supplies for the products needed for our preclinical studies or clinical trials or for our commercial products, which could lead to delays in studies, trials, or our commercial supply.\nIf any of our manufacturers or suppliers fails to perform its respective obligations, or if our supply of certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials is limited or interrupted, ultimately we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the experience, capabilities or resources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer or supplier, and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all.\nRisks Related to Our Regulation by the FDA and other Government Entities\nFailure to maintain required regulatory approvals would severely limit our ability to sell our products.\nWe must maintain our domestic regulatory approvals to continue to commercialize our products in the U.S. We must demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or efficacy, of cell therapy products to obtain FDA regulatory approval prior to marketing in the U.S. Demonstration of safety and efficacy requires the conduct of nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials in compliance with FDA, International Conference of Harmonization (\u201cICH\u201d) and applicable local regulations. The FDA regulatory review process to obtain marketing approval is a rigorous process that requires demonstrating the ability to manufacture the product in compliance with cGMP in addition to demonstrating a favorable risk/benefit profile and making certain post-marketing commitments.\nTo date, our product commercialization efforts have been limited to the U.S. In the event we market any products outside of the U.S. in the future, we will be required to maintain our foreign regulatory approvals in compliance with regulatory requirements and applicable local regulations to allow for commercialization outside the U.S. Regulatory requirements outside\nthe U.S. often require additional studies and data to obtain registration and, as a result, approval timelines can also be longer than those in the U.S.\nThe safety, potency and purity of our products must be monitored to be in compliance with FDA requirements for safety, cGMP, and all other applicable regulations. This requires adverse event monitoring and reporting to regulatory agencies, as well as submission and approval of any changes in the manufacturing process. Our manufacturing and testing facilities are subject to FDA periodic inspections for compliance with cGMP requirements. Failure to meet regulatory requirements and post-marketing commitments and maintain cGMP compliance could result in severe and detrimental regulatory actions, including the loss of marketing approval.\nAny changes in the regulatory requirements that affect our products and/or future product candidates could prevent, limit or delay our ability to market or develop new product candidates.\nFDA regulations establish the regulatory requirements for drugs, devices and biological products. Our cell therapy products are regulated as devices or biologics under current regulations. Biologics require BLA approval in the U.S. prior to being marketed. The regulations and guidance that govern the approval of biological products for marketing in the U.S. are subject to review and change by the FDA, and such potential changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to market our products and bring new products to the market.\nThe price and sale of any of our products may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products will depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and the extent to which third-party payers, including health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and government health administration authorities such as the military, Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs will pay for the cost of the products and related treatment. Hospitals and other healthcare provider clients that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which such products are used, sometimes including the cost of the purchase of these products. See section entitled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Pharmaceutical Coverage and Reimbursement\u201d.\nMany private payers in the U.S. use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. While certain procedures using our products are currently covered by Medicare and other third-party payers, future action by CMS or other government agencies, including the imposition of coverage and reimbursement limitations, may diminish payments to physicians, outpatient centers and/or hospitals for covered services. Additionally, payers may require us to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and current and future product candidates to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our products and future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. As a result, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level or reimbursed at all. Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the U.S. has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Increasingly, third-party payers have attempted to control costs by challenging the prices charged for medical products. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level. Nor can we be certain that third-party payers using a methodology that sets amounts based on the type of procedure performed, such as those utilized in many privately managed care systems and by Medicare, will view the cost of our products as justified so as to incorporate such costs into the overall cost of the procedure.\nMoreover, we are unable to predict what changes will be made to the reimbursement methodologies used by third-party payers in the future. As a result of the continuing evaluation and assessment of these expected payments, our estimates for expected payments could change. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of such reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product or product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in our products and future product development. If coverage or adequate reimbursement is not available, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels, we may not be able to successfully grow the sales of our products or commercialize any current and future product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product or product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe are subject to significant regulation with respect to the manufacturing of our products. If we are not able to comply with such regulation, our business may be materially harmed.\nAll of those involved in the preparation of a cellular therapy for commercial sale or clinical trials, including our existing supply contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators, are subject to extensive and continuing government regulations by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors and suppliers are subject to pre-approval and routine FDA inspections for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of FDA approval of our products.\nGenerally, if any FDA inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third-party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales, recalls, warning letters, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWe could incur significant costs complying with environmental and health and safety requirements, or as a result of liability for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use.\nOur research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental requirements, including regulations governing the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharge to air and water, the cleanup of contamination and occupational health and safety matters. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites where we have sent waste. These could include costs relating to contamination that did not result from any violation of law, and in some circumstances, contamination that we did not cause. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws. Any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. The enactment of stricter laws or regulations, the stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at our own or at a third-party site may require us to make additional expenditures, which could be material.\nIn order to obtain marketing authorization of any of our current or future therapy product candidates in the U.S., the FDA requires us to submit a BLA or marketing application, which is subject to the agency\u2019s detailed review and the denial of such applications could negatively impact our prospects, financial condition and future results.\nCell therapy and other products require FDA review under an appropriate marketing application prior to commercialization. Future cell and other biologic therapy candidates would be subject to FDA\u2019s biological product requirements and would require submission of a BLA. The BLA is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce in the U.S. and, once submitted, undergoes a detailed and rigorous review by the FDA. The review process includes, among other requirements, pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility. Additionally, approval may rely on post-market commitments. These commitments may include costly activities, such as additional clinical trials, and a failure to meet these commitments can result in negative actions by the FDA, including the withdrawal of the product from the market.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be significantly and negatively affected by substantial governmental regulations.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Overall, there appears to be a trend toward more stringent regulation worldwide, and we do not anticipate that this trend will dissipate in the near future.\nIn general, the development, testing, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the U.S. and abroad. The regulatory process requires the expenditure of significant time, effort and expense to bring new products to market. For example, the FDA approved Epicel as a HUD pursuant to an HDE application. A HUD is a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a\ndisease or condition that affects not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. Once a HUD receives a HDE from the FDA, the product may be marketed and sold in the U.S. However, IRB approval is required before a HUD can be used at a facility, with the exception of emergency use. The HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that the product is administered only in facilities having an IRB that is constituted and which acts in accordance with the agency\u2019s regulation governing IRBs, including the requirement of continuing review of the use of the device. HUDs are also subject to additional FDA requirements, such as adverse event reporting and the submission of updated information on a periodic basis to demonstrate that the HUD designation is still valid. Failure to meet FDA requirements pertaining to a HUD could result in the suspension or revocation of the HDE.\nIf the HDE for Epicel is suspended or revoked, marketing approval for the product would require the submission and approval of a PMA in order for Epicel to be commercially available. The PMA process is costly, lengthy and uncertain. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. If the HDE approval for Epicel was withdrawn, and we were unable to obtain premarket approval through the PMA process, we would be unable to market Epicel for sale in the U.S.\nWe are also required to implement and maintain stringent reporting, labeling and record keeping procedures for our products, both in the U.S., and abroad. Specifically, in the U.S., both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including the FDA\u2019s cGMP recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements, adverse event reporting regulations and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and through submission of annual reports. Our failure to comply with federal, state and foreign governmental regulations could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or the closure of our manufacturing facility are possible.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical, biologic and medical device industries also are subject to many complex laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and which target healthcare fraud and abuse. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation. In many instances, manufacturers and the life science industry do not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In certain public statements, governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available. Some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged.\nVarious federal and state agencies have become increasingly active in recent years in their investigation and prosecution of various business practices, such as through the enforcement of the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and the FFDCA and/or similar state laws. Governmental and regulatory actions against us could result in various consequences that could adversely impact our operations, including:\n\u2022The recall or seizure of products;\n\u2022The suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product;\n\u2022The suspension of shipments from particular manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022The imposition of fines and penalties;\n\u2022The delay of our ability to introduce new products into the market;\n\u2022Our exclusion or the exclusion of our products from being reimbursed by federal and state healthcare programs (such as military, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs and/or Civilian Health and Medical Program Uniformed Service, or CHAMPUS); and\n\u2022Other civil or criminal prosecution or sanctions against us or our officers, directors and employees, such as fines, penalties or imprisonment.\nAny of these consequences, in combination or alone, or even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the U.S., if the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of certain products, refuse to grant pending applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may\nalso impose operating restrictions on a companywide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend further investigation and prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d). Adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products.\nIn many of the foreign countries in which our products may be marketed in the future, we will be subject to regulations affecting, among other things, clinical efficacy, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import/export restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries, such as the Medicinal Products Directive and the ATMP guidelines governing products in the EU, are similar to those imposed by the FDA. In addition, in many countries the national health or social security organizations of those nations may require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. Failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could also be detrimental to our future growth.\nAs both U.S. and foreign government regulators have become increasingly stringent, we may be subject to more rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Our products and our operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d). If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business will be harmed.\nNexoBrid has been designated as an orphan drug in the U.S., but we may be unable to obtain or maintain such a designation or the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including marketing exclusivity, which may cause our revenue to be reduced.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the U.S for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S of such drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested to and granted by the FDA before submitting a BLA. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the biologic was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity, which would most likely run concurrently with the exclusivity, if any, received from the time of first licensure of a reference product, does not prevent the FDA from approving a different biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition.\nSuch a designation may be revoked by the FDA in certain circumstances, such as if the agency finds that the applicant\u2019s request for designation request omitted material information required under the Orphan Drug Act and its implementing regulations. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan exclusivity if the applicant is unable to manufacture sufficient supply of the product subject to a period of orphan drug marketing exclusivity.\nChanges to our products or future product candidates may require regulatory approvals and a denial of such required approval will negatively impact our prospects, financial condition and future results.\nChanges or modifications in the manufacturing process of any of our products may require the submission of supplements to our BLAs, HDE application, and INDs. These supplements require the generation of data to support the change, and the review and approval by the FDA to obtain authorization for the change in the commercial product or in the investigational biological product before they can be implemented. Obtaining regulatory approvals for these changes may require the conduct of new studies and the purchase of new equipment to justify the change. This can be costly and time consuming. Regulatory delays can adversely impact our ability to improve our products and to introduce new products in a timely manner, which can be detrimental to our future growth.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nThe manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for each of our products is subject to continued regulatory reporting and periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as other domestic and foreign regulatory agencies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with cGMP and GTP regulations for the manufacture of our products and other regulations which include methods and documentation of production controls, labeling, packaging, storage and shipment of any product, to name a few. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA enforce the cGMP, GTP and other regulations through periodic inspections and reporting. For example, the holder of an approved BLA or HDE is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and product failures, including critical deviations and lack of efficacy. A BLA or HDE device holder must maintain regulatory compliance for all aspects of the applicable regulations or the holder can be subject to regulatory action, including the recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.\nProduct manufacturers are subject to payment of annual prescription drug product program user fees and their facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with cGMP and other applicable regulations. If at any time we or a regulatory agency discovers a previously unknown safety concern with a product, such as a serious adverse event of unanticipated severity or frequency that cannot be adequately managed and changes the risk-benefit profile of the product, or there are problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including suspension of manufacturing, recall or the withdrawal of the product from the market.\nThe failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable legal statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional or review observations, or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022Unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022Client notifications for repair, replacement, or refund of a product;\n\u2022Recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022Denial, refusal or delay of our requests for approval of new products or proposed changes to existing products;\n\u2022Implementation of operating restrictions;\n\u2022Withdrawal of product approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022Refusal to approve a pending marketing application, such as a BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us;\n\u2022Refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022Criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer, preventing us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key suppliers or partners may have compliance issues, which could impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities.\nInadequate funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve regulatory submissions and new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. The average time to review and approve regulatory submissions at the agency has fluctuated in recent years as a result of some of these factors. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may depend, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, several times in recent years, including most recently from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019, the U.S. government has shut down. As a result, certain regulatory agencies, including the FDA, have had to furlough essential employees and stop critical activities in the past. Additionally, as of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it is continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and approval timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval facility inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. Throughout the pandemic, several companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs in the future, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the FDA determines that we have marketed or promoted our products for one or more off-label uses, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nAlthough federal law and the FDA do not restrict practicing healthcare professionals from, in the practice of medicine, prescribing and using our products to treat patients with conditions that the physician believes our products are clinically appropriate for, under the FFDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for uses that are inconsistent with the uses that have been approved by the FDA - also known as \u201coff-label\u201d uses. This means, for example, that we may not make claims about the use of any of our marketed products, including MACI or Epicel, which are outside of their approved labeling and indications. Consequently, our sales representatives may not proactively discuss or provide information to healthcare professionals on such off-label uses. Should the FDA determine that our activities constitute off-label promotion, the FDA could bring an action to prevent us from distributing MACI or Epicel for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives.\nIn addition, advertising and promotional materials, including educational and website material, must comply with the FDA\u2019s promotional and advertising regulations in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws, and such materials for biologics are subject to submission and review by CBER of the FDA. Failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve a product, the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions and/or criminal prosecutions.\nIf the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, the DOJ, or another federal or state agency determines that we have promoted the off-label use of our products and/or we have violated anti-kickback laws, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, and the off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability lawsuits, which could be costly to our business.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions concerning the manner in which we market our products, several other state and federal healthcare laws have been applied by the DOJ and state attorneys general to restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical and medical technology industries. While physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses and indications, a company is prohibited from promoting an approved product for uses not consistent with its approved label. In addition, anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce a healthcare professional or another individual or entity to purchase or prescribe a\nparticular drug, biologic or medical device. If other federal or state regulatory authorities determine that we have engaged in off-label promotion and/or engaged in conduct violative of ant-kickback laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and could be prohibited from participating in government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare. In addition, government agencies or departments could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion or violations of anti-kickback laws and, potentially, caused the submission of false claims. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and our ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims being pursued against us. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nHealth care reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products.\nIn the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our potential customers. See section entitled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Healthcare Reform\u201d.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (jointly, the ACA), which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers.\nThese laws, and other state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Litigation and legislative efforts to change or repeal the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nWhile we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this law or any replacement law will have in general or specifically on any product we may commercialize in the future, modifications to the Affordable Care Act or any replacement thereof may result in downward pressure on reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of new products. Any rebates, discounts, taxes costs or regulatory or systematic changes on healthcare resulting from the Affordable Care Act or its replacement may have a significant effect on our profitability in the future. We cannot predict whether the Affordable Care Act will continue or what other laws or proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us.\nIndividual states have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally-mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRegional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nGiven recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, the executive branch, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For example, on July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the FDA to, among other things, continue to clarify and improve the approval framework for biosimilars, including the standards for interchangeability of biological products, facilitate the development and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable products, clarify existing requirements and procedures related to the review and submission of BLAs, and identify and address any efforts to impede biosimilar competition. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such government action or legislation, it may harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities\u2019 assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians, prescribers, purchasers, third-party payors, charitable organizations and patients will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose biotechnology and biopharmaceutical manufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, and the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products. In particular, the research of our product candidates, as well as the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. See the section entitled, \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Other Healthcare Laws\u201d.\nThe distribution of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, our ability to operate our business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTissue-based products are regulated differently in different countries. These requirements may be costly and result in delay or otherwise preclude the distribution of our products in some foreign countries, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nTissue based products are regulated differently in different countries. Many foreign jurisdictions have a different, and potentially more difficult, regulatory pathway for human tissue-based products, which may prohibit the distribution of these products until the applicable regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may never seek such approvals, or if we do, we may never gain those approvals. Furthermore, any adverse events in our clinical trials could negatively impact our products and product candidates.\nCompetitor companies may be able to take advantage of additional FDA guidance and new expedited programs designed for cell therapies to develop and/or commercialize new products in a shorter time period than previously predicted or in certain cases without a BLA. If we cannot remain competitive in light of such developments, our business may suffer.\nRecognizing the importance of the cell therapy field, Congress included several provisions related to regenerative medicine in the Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016. Building on the FDA\u2019s existing expedited programs available to regenerative medicine products, one of these provisions established a new program to help foster the development and approval of these products: the RMAT designation.\nOn November 16, 2017, the FDA also announced a comprehensive policy framework for the development and oversight of regenerative medicine products, including novel cellular therapies. This framework completes a risk-based regulatory approach that further describes the appropriate pathway for products that contain tissue or cells including more clearly defining which products may be considered only minimally manipulated or for homologous use.\nWith these changes in guidance and expedited programs, competitors may be able to make sales in the U.S. with minimally manipulated or homologous use products without the necessity of a BLA. In addition, competitors may also be able to obtain accelerated approval of new cell therapy products through use of RMAT designation.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to fulfill our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to intellectual property license agreements with third parties, including our license agreement with MediWound Ltd. for NexoBrid, and we may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that our future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or a reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. In addition, if these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours after the expiry of data exclusivity. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to our products, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding the processing of our products, is maintained by us as trade secrets. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have no patent protection for Epicel, which could adversely impact Epicel\u2019s competitive position.\nWe have no issued patents or pending patent applications relating to Epicel. While we attempt to protect our proprietary information as trade secrets through certain agreements with our employees, consultants, agents and other organizations to which we disclose our proprietary information, we cannot give any assurance that these agreements will provide effective\nprotection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. If other cultured epidermal autografts are approved and marketed, we will be unable to prevent them from competing with Epicel in the marketplace. We expect that the presence of one or more competing products would reduce our market share and could negatively impact price levels and third-party reimbursement for Epicel, any of which would materially affect our business.\nSome of our issued patents relating to MACI have already expired and others may be insufficient to protect our business.\nWe have issued patents in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries that relate to the combinations of chondrocytes and collagen membranes used in MACI. However, some of these have expired. Other patent filings that include technology relevant to MACI (e.g., its production and/or use of chondrocytes and collagen membranes) include granted patents inside and outside the U.S., and pending applications inside and outside the U.S.; these granted patents and pending applications, if granted, are expected to expire, absent any extensions, between late-2022 and late-2038. Whether or not these patent filings are or will be issued patents, they may not be sufficient to protect our product revenue. We may be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated if our patents fail to issue or expire, or are revoked.\nThe patents we own may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with significant commercial protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are similar to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications or that the scope of the claims in our pending patent applications will not be significantly narrowed.\nIf our patents and proprietary rights do not provide substantial protection, then our business and competitive position will suffer.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to develop or license intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary products and technologies. This involves complex legal, scientific, and factual questions and uncertainties. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright and contract laws to protect proprietary technology and trademark law to protect brand identities. However, we cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by, assigned to, or licensed to us will lead to patents, and that the scope of any of our issued or licensed patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us could be successfully challenged, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. We also cannot assure you that the inventors of the patents and applications that we own or license were the first to invent or the first to file on the inventions, or that a third-party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third-party does not have or will not obtain patents that dominate the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nPatent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights in this country and abroad are subject to this uncertainty. From time to time, the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe cannot assure you that our patent portfolio or our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by the guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nThere can be no assurance that future decisions of the Supreme Court or other federal courts will not have a negative impact on biotechnology patents generally or the ability of biotechnology companies to obtain or enforce their patents in the future. Such negative decisions by the Supreme Court or other federal courts could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can, in many cases, be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable\nrules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or current and future product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWith respect to MACI, if we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the U.S. and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\nThe preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products throughout the world.\nEven if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights in order to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\nA successful challenge to our trademarks could force us to rebrand Epicel or MACI, which could result in a loss of brand recognition and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our trademarks to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register a number of these trademarks. Third parties may challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing these new brands.\nIntellectual property litigation could harm our business. We may be subject to patent infringement claims that could be costly to defend, which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies, and which could prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of some of our products, require us to pay licensing fees to have freedom to operate and/or result in monetary damages or other liability for us.\nThe success of our business will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and other proprietary rights of others. Our cell processing system and cell compositions utilize a wide variety of technologies and we can give no assurance that we have identified or can identify all inventions and patents that may be infringed by development and manufacture of our cell compositions. If the technology that we use infringes a patent held by others, we could be sued for monetary damages by the patent holder or its licensee, or we could be prevented from continuing research, development, and commercialization of products that rely on that technology, unless we are able to obtain a license to use the patent. The cost and availability of a license to a patent cannot be predicted, and the likelihood of obtaining a license at an acceptable cost would be lower if the patent holder or any of its licensees is using the patent to develop or market a product with which any of our existing or future product candidates or our products would compete. If we could not obtain a necessary license, we would need to develop or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which could prove costly and could cause delays in product development, or we could be forced to discontinue the development or marketing of any products that were developed using the technology covered by the patent.\nAlthough we have not been subject to any filed patent infringement claims, patents could exist or could be filed which would prohibit or limit our ability to market our products or maintain our competitive position. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. Such litigation is typically protracted and the results are unpredictable. Intellectual property litigation would divert management\u2019s attention from developing our products and would force us to incur substantial costs regardless of whether we are successful. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties including treble damages and the opposing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, and force us to pay significant license fees and royalties or cease the development and sale of our products and processes.\nWe have hired and expect to continue to hire individuals who have experience in cell culture and cell-based therapeutics and may have confidential trade secret or proprietary information of third parties. We caution these individuals not to use or reveal\nthis third-party information, but we cannot assure you that these individuals will not use or reveal this third-party information. Thus, we could be sued for misappropriation of proprietary information and trade secrets. Such claims are expensive to defend and could divert our attention and could result in substantial damage awards and injunctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nLitigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022Others may be able to make products that are the same as or similar to our products or product candidates, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022We or any strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022We might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u2022Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where\nwe do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u2022The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOthers may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for infringement.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Common Stock\nOur common stock price has been volatile and future sales of shares of common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of such shares.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock has been volatile, ranging in closing price between $30.93 and $67.81 during January 4, 2021 through January 31, 2022. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u2022Announcements of research activities, business developments, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Entering into or terminating strategic relationships;\n\u2022Information related to decisions by regulatory authorities regarding our products or product candidates or other regulatory developments or guidance in both the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022Disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u2022Changes in our revenues or expense levels;\n\u2022Changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022Substantial changes in reimbursement practices;\n\u2022The amount of our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022Seasonal or other variations in patient demand for MACI and Epicel;\n\u2022Demand for and clinical acceptance of our products;\n\u2022The timing of sales of products and of the introduction of new products;\n\u2022Public concern regarding the safety, efficacy or other aspects of the products or methodologies we are developing;\n\u2022Clinical trial results;\n\u2022News or reports from other stem cell, cell therapy or regenerative medicine companies;\n\u2022Actual or threatened litigation or governmental investigations or other major developments in such matters;\n\u2022Reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022Status and condition of the investment markets;\n\u2022Public or private sales of additional securities;\n\u2022Cybersecurity incidents that materially affect our products, services, relationships or competitive conditions;\n\u2022Loss of key personnel;\n\u2022The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, prospects and financial condition;\n\u2022Changes in management or the Board of Directors; and\n\u2022Concerns related to management transitions.\nAny of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall, which may adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility recently that often has been unrelated to the operating performance or financial conditions of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or prospects.\nThe sale of our common stock through future equity offerings may cause dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of our common stock offered through future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nOn August 27, 2021, we entered into a Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, as sales agent (\u201cSVB Leerink\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $200.0 million of shares of our common stock, no par value per share (\u201cATM Shares\u201d).\nThe ATM Shares to be offered and sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued and sold pursuant to an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-259119) filed by the Company on August 27, 2021, which expires within three years from the filing date. We also filed a prospectus supplement relating to the offering and sale of the ATM Shares on August 27, 2021. Vericel is not obligated to make any sales of ATM Shares, and SVB Leerink is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of the ATM Shares under the Sales Agreement. We capitalize certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with in-process stock financings as deferred offering costs until such financings are consummated. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, Vericel has sold no shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nGeneral Risks\nThe use of our products and future product candidates may expose us to product liability claims, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance. As a result, such claims could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the manufacture and/or use of our products during clinical trials, or after commercialization, result in adverse events. Moreover, we derive the raw materials for our products from patients serving as their own donors, the production process is complex, and the handling requirements are specific. All of these factors increase the likelihood of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. Although we are not currently subject to any product liability proceedings and we have no reserves for product liability disbursements, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage of our products. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. Excessive insurance costs or uninsured claims would increase our operating loss and adversely affect our financial condition. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and could result in, among other things:\n\u2022Significant awards against us;\n\u2022Substantial litigation costs;\n\u2022Recall of the product;\n\u2022Injury to our reputation;\n\u2022Withdrawal of clinical trial participants; or\n\u2022Adverse regulatory action.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to raise the required capital to develop and commercialize our future product candidates and otherwise grow and expand our business.\nNotwithstanding the net proceeds we received from previous public offerings, we may require substantial additional capital resources for strategic opportunities.\nIn order to grow and expand our business, to introduce other new product candidates into the marketplace, we may need to raise additional funds. We may also need significant additional funds or a collaborative partner, or both, to finance the research and development activities of future cell therapy product candidates for additional indications or in additional markets.\nOur future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u2022Continued scientific progress in our research, clinical and development programs;\n\u2022Costs and timing of conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Avoiding infringement and misappropriation of third-party intellectual property;\n\u2022Obtaining valid and enforceable patents that give us a competitive advantage;\n\u2022Our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships;\n\u2022Our ability to scale up our production capabilities for larger quantities of our products;\n\u2022The effect of commercialization activities and facility improvements and expansions, if and as required; and\n\u2022Complementary business acquisitions or development opportunities.\nWe may try to access the public or private equity markets if conditions are favorable to complete a financing, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time, or whenever we require additional operating capital. In addition, we may seek collaborative relationships, incur debt and access other available funding sources. This additional funding may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Some of the factors that will impact our ability to raise additional capital and our overall success include:\n\u2022Our ability to further commercialize our products;\n\u2022The rate and degree of progress of our product development;\n\u2022The rate of regulatory approval to proceed with clinical developmental programs;\n\u2022The level of success achieved in clinical trials;\n\u2022The requirements necessary for marketing authorization from regulatory bodies in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022The liquidity and market volatility of our equity securities; and\n\u2022Regulatory and manufacturing requirements and uncertainties, and technological developments by competitors.\nIf adequate funds are not available in the future, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements and we may be required to delay or terminate research and development programs, curtail capital expenditures, and reduce business development and other operating activities, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.\nWe rely upon third parties for certain aspects of our business, including collaboration partners, wholesale distributors, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers. Because of the recent tightening of global credit and the volatility in the financial markets, there may be a delay or disruption in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our key manufacturing, quality and other management personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nOur success depends in large part upon the efforts of our key management and manufacturing and quality staff. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our future prospects. In the future, we may need to seek additional manufacturing and quality staff members. There is a high demand for highly trained manufacturing and quality personnel in our industry. We face competition for such personnel from other companies, research and academic institutions and other entities. For example, multiple companies with operations in Massachusetts have developed or are continuing to develop vaccines and/or treatments for COVID-19. In some instances, these companies are undertaking large-scale manufacturing operations in order to potentially supply their products throughout the U.S. and internationally. In many instances, these companies have advertised hundreds of open manufacturing positions to support these scale-ups. Although, to date, we have not experienced a significant number of departures among our manufacturing staff, we cannot be sure such departures will not occur in the future. We do not know whether we will be able to attract, train and retain highly qualified manufacturing and quality personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A loss of one or more of our key personnel could severely and negatively impact our operations. Our key personnel are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our key management, manufacturing, quality or other personnel.\nEfforts to comply with securities laws and regulations require management resources, and we still may fail to comply. If we are not able to comply with such laws and regulations, there may be a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on their internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. The independent registered public accounting firm auditing our consolidated financial statements is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If, in any year, we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is required to, but is unable to provide us with a report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our securities.\nOur corporate documents and Michigan law contain provisions that may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of these shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Michigan law contains a statute that makes it more difficult for a 10% shareholder, or its officers, to acquire a company. This authority, together with certain provisions of our charter documents, may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company. This effect could occur even if our shareholders consider the change in control to be in their best interest.\nChanges to tax legislation and regulations could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. In particular, although the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the U.S. tax rate to 21 percent the law is complex and further regulations and interpretations are still being issued. We could face audit challenges on how we apply the new law that could have a negative impact on our provision for income taxes. In addition, particularly in light of the Biden Administration, our future earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in tax legislation, including a repeal or modification of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, changes in tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions or tax credits, increase taxing of certain excess income from intellectual property, revising tax law interpretations and changes in other tax laws in the U.S.", "PERMNO": 84511, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "VCEL"}
