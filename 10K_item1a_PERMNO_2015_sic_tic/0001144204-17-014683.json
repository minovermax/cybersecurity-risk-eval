{"cik": "1324189", "company": "Orchids Paper Products CO /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our operations. The risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth below may cause our actual results, performances or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or events occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. The risk factors set forth below are not exhaustive and are not the only risks that may affect our business. Our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or described below. We may amend or supplement the risk factors described below from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC in the future.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the construction project of our South Carolina facility on schedule or at all. Our failure to realize the benefits that we anticipate from this investment could substantially adversely affect our strategic plans and our financial position and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the paper mill construction, installation of the paper machines, installation of the recycling equipment, ramp-up of the mill, or ramp-up of the converting production lines at our Barnwell, South Carolina facility will proceed on schedule for the anticipated cost or at all. If the equipment suppliers fail to timely deliver the proper equipment or the construction of the paper mill facility is delayed due to unforeseen issues, we may be unable to complete the construction project and bring the facility to full capacity in a timely and cost effective manner, and as a result our business and projections could be adversely impacted.\nWe have indebtedness, which subjects us to restrictive covenants relating to the operation of our business.\nAs a result of closing the Fabrica Transaction, the expansion of our Pryor facility, and the construction of our South Carolina facility, our indebtedness is now substantially greater than our indebtedness prior to these events. At December 31, 2016, we had $142.0 million of indebtedness. In 2017, under the terms of our existing loan agreement, we anticipate making principal payments of $7.6 million and interest payments of more than $6 million. Interest payments are principally variable with our leverage ratio and with LIBOR rates. Operating with this amount of leverage and with variable interest rates may require us to direct a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt, which reduces the funds otherwise available for operations, capital expenditures, payment of dividends, the pursuit of future business opportunities and other corporate purposes. It may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and may impair our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe terms of our loan agreements require us to meet specified financial ratios and other financial and operating covenants, which restrict our ability to incur additional debt, place liens on our assets, make capital expenditures, effect mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets or pay dividends in certain circumstances. The financial covenants include that we must maintain a certain debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio for a given period. Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Credit Agreement, and is as quoted by the Company. Specifically this covenant ratio requires that we maintain, as determined at the end of each of our fiscal quarters, a ratio of (i) the aggregate amount of all debt (exclusive of capitalized loan amortization fees), to (ii) (Adjusted) EBITDA of not less than 5.75:1, 5.5:1, 4.5:1, 4:1 and 3.5:1 for the periods ending March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018 and each quarter thereafter, respectively. The financial covenants also include that Fixed Charges, as defined in the Credit Agreement, will not exceed a ratio 1.2:1 of an alternative Adjusted EBITDA figure, also defined in the Credit Agreement. If we fail to meet those financial ratios and covenants and our lenders do not waive them, we may be required to pay fees and penalties, and our lenders could accelerate the maturity of our debt and proceed against any pledged collateral, which could force us to seek alternative financing, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or liquidity. If this were to happen, we may be unable to obtain additional financing or it may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nAt December 31, 2016, our debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.26, and the Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was 1.86. These ratios are highly sensitive to changes in Adjusted EBITDA, and relatively sensitive to levels of debt and Fixed Charges. If we do not comply with these covenants in the current quarter or future quarters, it could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which may require us to seek and obtain a waiver from our lender, seek other amendments to our Credit Agreement, raise additional equity funds to pay-down debt, limit fixed charges inclusive of dividends, refinance the debt under more favorable terms, and/or undertake some combination of these in order to remain in compliance with the covenants. In such an event, there can be no assurance that we will be able to be successfully undertake such efforts and remain in compliance with the covenants, particularly in the short-term given the sensitivity to unforeseen changes in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, if a default under the Credit Agreement is not cured or waived, the default could result in the acceleration of debt under our Credit Agreement, which could require us to repay debt prior to the date it is otherwise due and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAdditionally, our indebtedness is secured by all or substantially all of our assets. Therefore, if we default on any of our debt obligations, it could result in the lenders foreclosing on our assets. In such an event, the lenders' rights to such assets would likely be superior to those of our shareholders.\nWe face intense competition and if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe consumer market for private label tissue products is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial, sales and marketing and capital resources than we do, which may allow them to respond more quickly to new opportunities or changes in customer requirements. These competitors may also be larger in size or scope than us, which may allow them to achieve greater economies of scale or allow them to better withstand periods of declining prices and adverse operating conditions.\nBy promoting their branded products, brand-competitors may erode private label tissue sales. Three large companies, Proctor and Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Georgia Pacific, have material shares of the brand-market in the United States, and their size may allow them to achieve greater economies of scale or allow them to better withstand adverse competition, declining prices, and adverse operating conditions. As a general business observation, consumers seem to prefer branded products over private-label unless a greater value proposition is perceived, hence competition between brands and private label can be intense.\nOur ability to successfully compete depends upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf aggressive pricing by competitors, which may force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u25cf our ability to improve plant efficiencies and operating rates and lower manufacturing costs;\n\u25cf the availability, quality and cost of labor and raw materials, particularly recycled fiber; and\n\u25cf the cost of energy.\nOur tissue paper products are commodity products, and if we do not maintain competitive prices, we may lose significant market share. Our ability to keep our prices at competitive levels depends in large part on our ability to control our costs. In addition, consolidation among retailers may put additional pressure on us to reduce our prices in order to maintain market share. If we are unable to effectively adjust our cost structure to address such increased competitive pressures, our sales level and profitability could be harmed and our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreased competition in our region may affect our business.\nOrchids has diversified regionally and by developing new channels and products. We anticipate continuing to diversify, but increased competition remains a significant risk. Private label manufacturers have announced greenfield capacity additions, principally in structured tissue lines, and while not generally in the same geographic regions in which we have operated, capacity additions may always affect the existing business and/or delay inroads into new higher-end product and brand markets. Continued or increased competition from brands may also affect our business by diminishing consumer demand for private-label products or delaying our inroads into brand markets.\nA substantial percentage of our net sales are attributable to two large customers, any or all of which may decrease or cease purchases at any time.\nOur two largest customers, Dollar General and Family Dollar accounted for 36% and 14%, respectively, of our net sales in 2016. We expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Sales to these customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and not supply agreements. We may not be able to keep our key customers, or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers would harm our sales and financial results. In particular, the loss of sales to one or more distribution centers would result in a sudden and significant decrease in our sales. If sales to current key customers cease or are reduced, we may not obtain sufficient orders from other customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions.\nWe primarily use pre-consumer solid bleached sulfate paper, or SBS paper, and, to a lesser extent, virgin kraft fibers to produce parent rolls and any disruption in our supply or increase in the cost of pre-consumer SBS paper or virgin kraft could disrupt our production and harm our ability to produce tissue at competitive prices.\nWe do not produce any of the fiber we use to produce our parent rolls. We depend heavily on access to sufficient, reasonably priced quantities of fiber to manufacture our tissue products. Our paper mill is configured to convert recycled fiber, specifically SBS paper, and virgin kraft fiber into paper pulp for use in our paper production lines. In 2016, we purchased approximately 79,000 tons of SBS paper at a total cost of $19.1 million compared to 73,000 tons of SBS paper at a total cost of $19.7 million in 2015. In 2016, we purchased approximately 9,000 tons of virgin kraft at a total cost of $5.5 million compared to 11,000 tons of virgin kraft at a total cost of $6.8 million in 2015. Prices for SBS paper and virgin kraft have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, principally due to market imbalances between supply and demand. In addition, the market price of SBS fiber can also be influenced by market swings in the price of virgin pulp and other fiber grades. If either the available supply of SBS paper and/or virgin kraft diminishes or the demand for SBS paper and/or virgin kraft increases, it could substantially increase our cost of fiber, require us to purchase alternate fiber grades at increased costs, or cause a production slow-down or stoppage until we are able to identify new sources of fiber or reconfigure our pulping plant to process other available forms of paper fiber. We could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations should the price or supply of SBS paper and/or virgin kraft be disrupted. Further, we currently obtain all of our recycled fiber from a single supplier, Dixie Pulp and Paper, Inc. (\"Dixie\") and the majority of our virgin kraft from Itochu Pulp and Paper Corp. (\u201cItochu\u201d). If our relationship with Dixie and/or Itochu is altered or terminated for any reason, we will have to seek alternative channels to obtain our recycled and virgin kraft fiber, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to make arrangements that adequately meet our needs or on reasonable terms. Furthermore, we may not be able to pass increased fiber costs on to our customers if the market does not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products.\nFabrica\u2019s failure to execute under the Supply Agreement could adversely affect our business.\nUnder the Supply Agreement with Fabrica de Papel San Francisco, S.A. de C.V. (\u201cFabrica\u201d), we have the right to purchase up to 19,800 tons of parent rolls and equivalent converting capacity for certain specified product during each twelve-month period following the effective date of the Supply Agreement, which has an initial term of twenty years. Fabrica\u2019s failure to execute under this agreement could result in our inability to service existing customers, thereby reducing sales volumes and profitability. A failure to execute would also harm the relationships we have established with those customers serviced under the Supply Agreement. Furthermore, Fabrica\u2019s failure to execute under this agreement could require us to look for other sources of capacity that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing costs and reducing profits.\nOur foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.\nWe currently source a significant amount of our converted products from Mexico, i.e. the 19,800 tons from the Supply Agreement, and we expect to continue to do so. Accordingly, we are subject to political, legal, tax and economic risks such as:\n\u25cf the effects of local political, labor and economic developments and unrest;\n\u25cf significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate;\n\u25cf significant changes to regulations or laws or the interpretation or enforcement of them, including with respect to tax and profit sharing matters arising out of the use of outsourced suppliers;\n\u25cf exchange controls and export restrictions;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations, particularly in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican Peso;\n\u25cf failure to maintain compliance with corruption and transparency statutes, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf laws or policies of foreign countries and the United States affecting trade, investment and taxation; and\n\u25cf civil disturbances, war and terrorist actions.\nThe occurrence of any one or combination of these events, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased competition and or deterioration in business conditions could adversely affect our ability to realize anticipated growth from the Fabrica Transaction.\nWe desired to acquire assets and certain operations from Fabrica with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits for us, including, among others, a competitive manufacturing cost, business and growth opportunities, and increased revenue streams. Increased competition and/or deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand upon Fabrica\u2019s former business. As such, we may not be able to realize the synergies, goodwill, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the Fabrica Transaction.\nChanges in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large format retailers and discounters. With the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including the large format retailers, may have greater bargaining power than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances, which could lead to reduced profitability. We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, and delisting of our products. If we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nExcess supply in the markets may reduce the prices we are able to charge for our products.\nNew paper machines or new converting equipment may be built or idle machines may be activated by other paper companies, which would add more capacity to the tissue markets. Increased production capacity could cause an oversupply resulting in lower market prices for our products and increased competition, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe availability of and prices for energy will significantly impact our business.\nThe production of our products requires a significant amount of energy and we rely primarily on natural gas and electricity for our energy needs. The prices of these inputs are subject to change based on many factors that are beyond our control, such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation. In particular, natural gas prices are highly volatile. Beginning in April 2009 and continuing through December 2017, approximately 70% to 90% of our natural gas requirements at our Pryor facilities were/are covered by a fixed price contract. The remainder of our requirements through December 2017 are expected to be purchased at market rates. Our natural gas requirements at our Barnwell paper mill, when it begins production in the first half of 2017 through October of 2018, are covered by a contract calling for deliveries at $0.36 per MMBTU greater than NYMEX market index (See Item 1 - Business, Raw Materials and Energy). Our average price per MMBTU was $3.92 in 2016 compared to $4.11 in 2015 and $5.05 in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we consumed 515,000 MMBTU of natural gas at a total cost of $2.0 million and 62.1 million kilowatt hours of electricity at a total cost of $3.1 million. If our energy costs increase, our cost of sales will increase, and our operating results may be materially, adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to pass increased energy costs on to our customers if the market does not allow us to raise the prices of our finished products. If price adjustments significantly trail the increase in energy costs or if we cannot effectively hedge against these costs, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to purchase the contracted quantity of natural gas may result in financial exposure.\nAs discussed above in Item 1 - Business, Raw Materials and Energy, we have entered into a fixed price contract to purchase approximately 80% to 90% of our natural gas requirements at our Pryor facilities, or 467,505 MMBTUs in 2017, with the remainder purchased on the open market. A significant interruption in our parent roll production due to tornado, fire or other natural disaster, adverse market conditions or mechanical failure could reduce our natural gas requirements to a level below that of our contracted amount. If we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price, we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the difference between the contracted amount and the amount actually purchased multiplied by the difference between our contract price and a price designed in the contract, which typically approximates spot price.\nOur exposure to variable interest rates may affect our financial health.\nDebt incurred under our existing revolving credit and most of our term loan agreements accrues interest at a variable rate. Specifically, our interest is calculated on LIBOR or the base rate plus an interest rate margin, which is calculated quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, our weighted average bank debt interest rate was 2.64% compared to a weighted average interest rate of 2.17% at December 31, 2015. In addition to varying with the underlying LIBOR rates, most of our rates vary dependent on our debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio as of the end of each prior quarter. Presently, the maximum margin added to LIBOR when the leverage ratio climbs to 5:1 or higher, is 4.0%. Any increase in the interest rates on our debt would result in a higher interest expense, which would require us to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For more information on our liquidity, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nWe depend on our management team to operate the Company and execute our business plan.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management staff, in particular Jeffrey Schoen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Rodney Gloss, our Chief Financial Officer. We have entered into employment arrangements with Jeffrey Schoen and Rodney Gloss, under which their employment is \"at will\" and, subject to certain conditions, may be terminated by either party at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. The loss of either of our executive officers or our inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nLabor interruptions would adversely affect our business.\nAll of our hourly paid employees in Oklahoma are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial & Service Workers International Union. The collective bargaining agreement with Local 5-930, which represents the paper mill workers, will expire in February 2018, and the collective bargaining agreement with Local 5-1480, which represents the converting facility workers, expired in June 2016, at which time it was extended for six months with limited modifications. We are currently operating under the terms of the interim agreement and expect to finalize negotiations for a new contract in the first quarter of 2017. Negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements may result in significant increases in the cost of labor or could break down and result in a strike or other disruption of our operations. If any of the preceding were to occur, it could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and/or decreased operating results. In addition, some of our key customers and suppliers are also unionized. Disruption in their labor relations could also have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur manufacturing operations may experience shutdowns due to unforeseen operational problems or maintenance outages, which may cause significant lost production which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe currently manufacture and process the majority of our tissue paper products in Pryor, Oklahoma. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facilities due to tornado, fire or any other calamity could damage our capital equipment or supporting infrastructure and materially impair our ability to manufacture and process tissue paper products. Even a short-term disruption in our production output could damage relations with our customers, causing them to reduce or eliminate the amount of finished products they purchase from us. Any such disruption could result in lost sales, increased costs and reduced profits.\nFurthermore, unexpected production disruptions due to any number of circumstances, including shortages of raw materials, disruptions in the availability of transportation, labor disputes and mechanical or process failures, could cause us to shut down our paper mill or our converting operation, or any part thereof.\nIf any part of our facilities is shut down, it may experience a prolonged start-up period, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those start-up periods could range from several days to several months, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. The shutdown of our facilities for a substantial period of time for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital, and we may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of our cash requirements.\nOur operations require substantial capital. Expansion or replacement of existing facilities or equipment may require substantial capital expenditures. For example, in 2016 we built two new converting lines in our new Barnwell facility, which cost approximately $43 million. In 2015 in Pryor, we built a new paper machine and installed a new converting line, which cost approximately $39 million. In 2010, we built a new finished goods warehouse and installed a new converting line, which cost approximately $27 million. In 2009 and 2010, under new environmental standards we were required to build a water treatment facility costing approximately $7 million to reduce BOD and TSS from our discharge water. We are currently building a new facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, which is expected to cost approximately $150.0 million, of which we have incurred $119.2 million to date, including the $43 million for the converting lines that began production in 2016. If our capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, this shortfall could have a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nOur business is subject to governmental regulations and any imposition of new regulations or failure to comply with existing regulations could involve significant additional expense.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations impose stringent standards on us regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, use and handling of hazardous materials, use, handling and disposal of waste, and remediation of environmental contamination. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions. These may include regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installing pollution control equipment or remedial actions, any of which could involve significant expenditures. Future development of such laws and regulations may require capital expenditures to ensure compliance. We may discover currently unknown environmental problems or conditions in relation to our past or present operations, or we may face unforeseen environmental liabilities in the future. These conditions and liabilities may require site remediation or other costs to maintain compliance or correct violations of environmental laws and regulations; or result in governmental or private claims for damage to person, property or the environment, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to strict liability and, under specific circumstances, joint and several liabilities for the investigation and remediation of the contamination of soil, surface and ground water, including contamination caused by other parties, at properties that we own or operate and at properties where we or our predecessors arranged for the disposal of regulated materials.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and, as a result, our business could be harmed and current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in us, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe have completed an evaluation of our internal control systems to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the management assessment and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In our report under Section 404, which is included in Item 9A of this report, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nA material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could materially affect our reported financial results and the market price of our stock could significantly decline. Additionally, adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal controls could have a negative effect on our reputation, business and stock price. Although management's assessment and auditor's attestation may provide some level of comfort to the investing public, even the best designed and executed systems of internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance against misreported results and the prevention of fraud.\nThe parent roll market is a commodity market and subject to fluctuations in demand and pricing.\nOverall demand for parent rolls can fluctuate due to changes in the demand for converted products and due to new paper machine start-ups. A significant reduction in demand or increase in paper making capacity can result in an over-supply of parent rolls, which could negatively affect the market price for parent rolls. A significant reduction in parent roll selling prices could reduce our net sales, decrease our profits and cause us to shut down some of our excess paper making capacity.\nIf we are unable to continue to implement our business strategies, our financial conditions and operating results could be materially affected.\nOur future operating results will depend, in part, on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategies in a cost effective manner. However, our strategies are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to sell the capacity generated from our converting lines.\nWe continue to focus on increasing the capacity of our twelve converting lines at our Pryor location. Additionally, the two converting lines at our South Carolina facility are believed to have added an additional 30,000 to 32,000 tons of annual capacity. However, we may not be able to sell enough of our products to fully utilize such capacity. . While the winning of private label bids and new branded sales business, previously announced, are expected to contribute greatly, there are no assurances that the promised volumes will be ordered by the customers. Our strategy includes converting and selling more of our parent roll tonnage as converted product. Converted products sell at a higher price per ton than parent rolls and typically carry a higher margin on a tonnage basis. If we are unable to increase our sales of converted product to fully utilize the capacity from our converting lines, it could result in lost opportunity for increased margins and the need to temporarily or permanently curtail the production of one or more of our converting lines.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nWe may not sustain our quarterly dividend.\nOn February 21, 2011, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. We paid dividends totaling $1.40 per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014. However, we may not sustain regular quarterly dividend payments. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Further, our Credit Agreement contains an indirect restriction on the payment of dividends, as dividends paid are included in calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under our Credit Agreement. If payments of dividends would otherwise result in us not meeting the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, we will be unable to pay dividends. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions may:\n\u25cf discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of the Company or a change in our management;\n\u25cf adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock; and\n\u25cf limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur future operating results may be below securities analysts' or investors' expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue and income potential depends on maintaining and expanding our production capacity and realizing buyers for our additional production, and we may be unable to generate significant revenues or grow at the rate expected by securities analysts or investors. In addition, our costs may be higher than we, securities analysts or investors expect. Further, if financial leverage and related risks escalate, capital spending required to complete the Barnwell project, and/or unforeseen cash flow disruptions were to occur, our stock prices could be adversely affected. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf the market price of our product;\n\u25cf the cost of fiber used in producing paper;\n\u25cf the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting facility;\n\u25cf the cost of energy.\n\u25cf the costs of labor and maintenance;\n\u25cf financial leverage undertaken, inclusive of its impacts upon interest expense and debt service;\n\u25cf capital spending requirements, inclusive of impacts upon depreciation; and\n\u25cf working capital and other cash flow management.\nOur operating results in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future performance. In some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock will likely decline.\nOur common stock has low average trading volume, and we expect that the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock in 2016 was approximately 75,000 shares. The market price for our common stock is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' earnings estimates; and\n\u25cf developments in our industry.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the paper products industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Because of the low trading volume, our stock price is subject to greater potential volatility. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Class action securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management resources, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur directors have limited personal liability and rights of indemnification from us for their actions as directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:\n\u25cf any breach of their duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;\n\u25cf acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u25cf unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or\n\u25cf any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive officers and other officers and employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nWe entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers, which are broader than the specific indemnification provision under Delaware law. Under these agreements, we are required to indemnify them against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred, in connection with any actual, or any threatened, proceeding if any of them may be made a party because he or she is or was one of our directors or officers.\nIf any litigation or proceeding were pursued against any of our directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification is required or permitted, we could incur significant legal expenses and be responsible for any resulting settlement or judgment.", "PERMNO": 90791, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "TISUQ"}
