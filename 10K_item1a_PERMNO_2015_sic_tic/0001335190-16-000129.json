The occurrence of one or more of these events or circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy cases.\nOn the Petition Date, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, our business and operations are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following: (i) incurring increased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation, (ii) a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom we have commercial relationships, (iii) potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating our key employees through the process of reorganization, and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees, and (iv) the effects of significant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management in dealing with the bankruptcy and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing. If we are unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to replace our proved reserves or to maintain current production levels and generate revenue will be limited.\nOur principal sources of liquidity historically have been equity contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from sales of certain non-core assets, and net proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes. Our capital program will require additional financing above the level of cash generated by our operations to fund growth. If our cash flow from operations remains depressed or decreases as a result of lower commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our proved reserves, maintain our leasehold acreage or maintain current production may be limited, resulting in decreased production and proved reserves over time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for and consummation of the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand and (ii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In the event that cash on hand and cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may be required to seek additional financing. We can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited if it is available at all. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nNatural gas and oil prices declined dramatically in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and remained low throughout 2015 and into 2016. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Natural gas and oil are commodities, and therefore their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for natural gas and oil have been extremely volatile. The speed and severity of the decline in oil and gas prices that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and into 2016 has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations and contributed to our decision to file the Chapter 11 Cases.\nDuring the past five years, the NYMEX price for West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as NYMEX-WTI, has ranged from a low of $34.73 per Bbl, in December 2015 to a high of $113.93 per Bbl in April 2011. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.53 per MMBtu in December 2015 to a high of $7.92 per MMBtu in March 2014. During 2015, NYMEX-WTI prices ranged from $34.73 to $61.43 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.53 to $3.29 per MMBtu.\nThese markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our daily production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\ni.\nthe current uncertainty in the global economy;\nii.\nchanges in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\niii.\nthe condition of the U.S. and global economies;\niv.\nthe actions of certain foreign countries;\nv.\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\nvi.\npolitical conditions, including embargoes, war or civil unrest in or affecting other oil producing activities of certain countries;\nvii.\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\nviii.\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\nix.\nproduction or pricing decisions made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC;\nx.\nweather conditions;\nxi.\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\nxii.\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per-unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically in the future. Higher operating costs associated with any of our oil or natural gas fields will make our profitability more sensitive to oil or natural gas price declines. A sustained decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, a sustained decline in oil or natural gas prices has and may continue to result in substantial downward estimates of our proved reserves.\nDrilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:\ni.\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\nii.\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\niii.\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\niv.\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\nv.\nequipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;\nvi.\nunexpected operational events and drilling conditions;\nvii.\npipe or cement failures;\nviii.\ncasing collapses;\nix.\nlost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;\nx.\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\nxi.\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas and fluids;\nxii.\nfires and natural disasters;\nxiii.\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\nxiv.\nadverse weather conditions;\nxv.\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\nxvi.\nnatural gas and oil property title problems; and\nxvii.\nmarket limitations for natural gas and oil.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices since none of our estimated future production is covered by commodity derivatives and we may not be able to enter into commodity derivatives covering our estimated future production on favorable terms or at all.\nIn the past, we have entered into financial commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in oil and natural gas prices. However, we have no remaining open commodity derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent to the termination of these derivative contracts, we have not entered into additional derivative contracts. During the Chapter 11 proceedings, our ability to enter into new commodity derivatives covering additional estimated future production will be dependent upon either entering into unsecured hedges or obtaining Bankruptcy Court approval to enter into secured hedges. As a result, we may not be able to enter into additional commodity derivatives covering our production in future periods on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot or choose not to enter into commodity derivatives in the future, we could be more affected by changes in commodity prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements. Our inability to hedge the risk of low commodity prices in the future, on favorable terms or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are able to enter into any commodity derivatives, they may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. These arrangements would also expose us to risk of financial losses in some circumstances, including the following:\ni.\nour production could be materially less than expected; or\nii.\nthe counterparties to the contracts could fail to perform their contractual obligations.\nIf our actual production and sales for any period are less than the production covered by any commodity derivatives (including reduced production due to operational delays) or if we are unable to perform our exploration and development activities as planned, we might be required to satisfy a portion of our obligations under those commodity derivatives without the benefit of the cash flow from the sale of that production, which may materially impact our liquidity. Additionally, if market prices for our production exceed collar ceilings or swap prices, we would be required to make monthly cash payments, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation and development. There is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield natural gas or oil in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable, particularly in light of the current economic environment. The use of seismic data and other technologies, and the study of producing fields in the same area, will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether natural gas or oil will be present or, if present, whether natural gas or oil gas will be present in commercially viable quantities. Moreover, the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nWe have relatively limited experience in drilling wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations and limited information regarding reserves and decline rates in these areas. Wells drilled to these areas are more expensive and more susceptible to mechanical problems in drilling and completion techniques than wells in conventional areas.\nWe have relatively limited experience in the drilling and completion of Marcellus and Utica Shale formation wells, including relatively limited horizontal drilling and completion experience. Other operators in these plays may have significantly more experience in the drilling and completion of these wells, including the drilling and completion of horizontal wells. In addition, we have limited information with respect to the ultimate recoverable reserves and production decline rates in these areas due to their limited histories. The wells drilled in Marcellus and Utica Shale formations are primarily horizontal and require more artificial stimulation, which makes them more expensive to drill and complete. The wells also are more susceptible to mechanical problems associated with the drilling and completion of the wells, such as casing collapse and lost equipment in the wellbore due to the length of the lateral portions of these unconventional wells. The fracturing of these formations will be more extensive and complicated than fracturing geological formations in conventional areas of operation.\nOur core properties are geographically concentrated, making us disproportionately vulnerable to risks associated with operating in our core areas of operation.\nOur core properties, natural gas reserves, and operations are geographically concentrated in West Virginia and Ohio. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of events or circumstances in these areas such as regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells caused by governmental regulation, gathering, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, or interruption of the gathering, processing or transportation of natural gas or natural gas liquids.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nEstimates of natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. To prepare our proved reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. In addition, our estimates of proved reserves have been, and could continue to be, reduced due to our inability to finance such reserves.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. As required by SEC rules and regulations, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 on the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows, standardized measure or PV-10 in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves. Actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\ni.\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\nii.\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\niii.\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\niv.\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation; and\nv.\nchanges in our ability to finance future development costs.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this annual report.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to timely file certain periodic reports with the SEC in the future would limit our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital; following the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we intend to seek to suspend our Exchange Act reporting obligations.\nWe have not filed within the time frames required by the SEC our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and consequently we are no longer eligible to use abbreviated and less costly SEC filings to register our securities for sale. Further, soon after filing our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we intend to seek to suspend our Exchange Act reporting obligations. As a result, we will no longer be eligible to use such abbreviated SEC filings, which will limit our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that would be beneficial to our business.\nA prolonged credit crisis would likely materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing. A prolonged credit crisis, such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and related turmoil in the global financial system would likely materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. The economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection.\nFuture economic conditions in the United States and global markets may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.\nThe United States and other world economies are slowly recovering from the economic recession that began in 2008. While economic growth has resumed, it remains modest and the timing of an economic recovery is uncertain. There are likely to be significant long-term effects resulting from the recession and credit market crisis, including a future global economic growth rate that is slower than what was experienced in the years preceding the recession. Economic production and business and consumer confidence levels have not yet fully recovered to pre-recession levels. In addition, more volatility may occur before a sustainable, yet lower, growth rate is achieved. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including for oil and natural gas. A lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nIf our access to natural gas and oil markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell natural gas and/or receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline gathering and transportation system capacity constraints.\nMarket conditions or the restriction in the availability of satisfactory natural gas and oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of natural gas and oil and the proximity of reserves to transportation infrastructure. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of pipeline gathering and transportation systems, processing facilities, terminals and rail and truck transportation owned and operated\nby third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our natural gas or oil may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production.\nThe amount of natural gas and oil being produced by us and others could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in these areas. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Because of the current economic climate, certain pipeline projects that are or may be planned for the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale areas may not occur for lack of financing. In addition, capital constraints could limit the ability to build or expand gathering systems, such as the Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System, necessary to gather our gas to deliver to interstate pipelines. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project for these specific regions, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of purchasers for a substantial portion of our revenue. The inability of one or more of our purchasers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a relatively small number of purchasers of our production. Our inability to continue to provide services to key customers, if not offset by additional sales to our other customers, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These companies may not provide the same level of our revenue in the future for a variety of reasons, including their lack of funding, a strategic shift on their part in moving to different geographic areas in which we do not operate or our failure to meet their performance criteria. In the event that purchasers of our production may experience financial difficulties or seek bankruptcy, our receivables from such purchasers may not be collectible. The loss of all or a significant part of this revenue would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages of equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, pipeline operators, oil and natural gas marketers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices and activity levels in certain regions where we are active, causing periodic shortages. During periods of high oil and gas prices, we have experienced shortages of equipment, including drilling rigs and completion equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with higher commodity prices and increased activity levels. In addition, there is currently a shortage of hydraulic fracturing and wastewater disposal capacity in many of the areas in which we operate. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, pipe and other midstream services equipment and qualified personnel in exploration, production and midstream operations. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells, construct gathering pipelines and conduct other operations that we currently have planned or budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nWe are dependent upon contractor, consultant and partnering arrangements.\nWe had a total of approximately 348 full-time employees as of December 31, 2015. Despite this number of employees, we expect that we will continue to require the services of independent contractors and consultants to perform various services, including professional services such as reservoir engineering, land, legal, environmental, accounting and tax services. We will also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and leasing. Our dependence on contractors, consultants and third-party service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed, and the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may suffer if we lose key personnel.\nOur operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and other senior management. Our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons do not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements. Additionally, we do not presently carry key person life insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and so are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all the properties in which we have an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\ni.\nthe nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\nii.\nthe timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\niii.\nthe operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\niv.\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\nv.\nthe operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nCompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, exploiting mineral leases, marketing natural gas and oil, treating and gathering third-party natural gas production and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects and establish and maintain more diversified and expansive midstream services than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in an efficient manner even in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, offering midstream services, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nThe use of geoscience, petro-physical and engineering analyses and other technical or operating data to evaluate drilling prospects is uncertain and does not guarantee drilling success or recovery of economically producible reserves.\nOur decisions to explore, develop and acquire prospects or properties targeting the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale depend on data obtained through geoscientific, petro-physical and engineering analyses, the results of which can be uncertain. Even when properly used and interpreted, data from whole cores, regional well log analyses and 2-D and 3-D seismic only assist our technical team in identifying hydrocarbon indicators and subsurface structures and estimating hydrocarbons in place. They do not allow us to know conclusively the amount of hydrocarbons in place and if those hydrocarbons are producible economically. In addition, the use of advanced drilling and completion technologies for the development of our unconventional resources, such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulations, requires greater expenditures than traditional development drilling strategies. Our ability to commercially recover and produce the hydrocarbons that we believe are in place and attributable to our properties will depend on the effective use of advanced drilling and completion techniques, the scope of our drilling program (which will be directly affected by the availability of capital), drilling and production costs, availability of drilling and completion services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, regulatory approval and geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. Our estimates of unproved reserves, estimated ultimate recoveries per well, hydrocarbons in place and resource potential may change significantly as development of our oil and gas assets provides additional data.\nWe rely on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use information technology to maintain, analyze and process, to varying degrees, our property information, reserve data, operating records (including amounts paid or payable to suppliers, working interest owners, royalty holders and others), drilling partnership records (including amounts paid or payable to limited partners and others), gas gathering, processing and transmission records, oil and gas marketing records and general accounting, legal, tax, corporate and\nsimilar records. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if our information technology resources fail or are compromised or damaged, whether due to a virus, intentional penetration or disruption by a third party, hardware or software corruption or failure or error, service provider error or failure, natural disaster, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other causes. A significant disruption in the functioning of these resources could adversely impact our ability to access, analyze and process information, conduct operations in a normal and efficient manner and timely and accurately manage our accounts receivable and accounts payable, among other business processes, which could disrupt our operations, adversely affect our reputation and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential business information also may subject us to liability, which could expose us to significant expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial results, stock price and reputation. Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, cessations of service or errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions, result in increased expenses and divert the attention of management and key information technology resources.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration, development and drilling methods to become obsolete.\nThe natural gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations, and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we may ultimately face.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses to protect against the risks we foresee. For example, we maintain (i) comprehensive general liability insurance, (ii) employer\u2019s liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance, (iii) automobile liability insurance, (iv) environmental insurance, (v) property insurance, (vi) directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, (vii) control of well insurance, (viii) pollution insurance and (ix) umbrella/excess liability insurance. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry, or may cease to carry, certain types or amounts of insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and under insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\ni.\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\nii.\nabnormally pressured formations;\niii.\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\niv.\nfires and explosions;\nv.\npersonal injuries and death; and\nvi.\nnatural disasters.\nEureka Midstream\u2019s midstream activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with constructing, operating and maintaining pipelines and related equipment and natural gas treating equipment, including the possibility of pipeline leaks, breaks and ruptures, pipeline damage due to natural hazards, such as ground movement and weather, equipment failures, explosions, fires, accidents and personal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then that accident or other event could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.\nWe purchase and acquire from third parties or directly from the mineral fee owners certain oil and gas leasehold interests and other real property interests upon which we will perform our drilling and exploration activities. The existence of a title deficiency can significantly devalue an acquired interest or render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we generally rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or internal or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest and before drilling a well on a leased tract. The failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nAdditional write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties could occur if oil and gas prices remain depressed or decline further or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results. It is likely that the cumulative effect of a write-down could also negatively impact the value of our securities, including our common and preferred stock and our senior notes.\nWe account for our crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Future wells are drilled that target geological structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature. A subsequent allocation of costs is then required to properly account for the results. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties. If capitalized costs exceed future cash flows, we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair value. Any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities, but will reduce our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity. When evaluating our properties, we are required to test for potential write-downs at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets, which is typically on a field by field basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $59.8 million in exploration expense, which includes leasehold impairment and expiration expense related to leases in the Williston and Appalachian Basin regions. Additionally, we recorded proved impairments of $275.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due primarily to the dramatic reduction in prices for oil and gas as well as changes in production estimates and lease operating costs indicating potential impairment of our Williston and Appalachian Basin proved properties, and the resulting provision for reduction to the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values.\nWe review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices subsequently increase. Given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets, prices could remain depressed or decline further or other events may arise that would require us to record further impairments of the book values associated with oil and gas properties. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would reduce our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThere are restrictive covenants, governance and other provisions in the New LLC Agreement that may restrict the ability of Eureka Midstream Holdings to pursue its business strategies and our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Midstream Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nWe are involved in midstream operations through our substantial equity investment in Eureka Midstream Holdings. The New LLC Agreement contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of Eureka Midstream Holdings and its subsidiaries to, with certain exceptions:\ni.\nissue additional equity interests;\nii.\npay distributions to its owners, or repurchase or redeem any of its equity securities;\niii.\nincur indebtedness;\niv.\nmodify, amend or terminate material contracts;\nv.\nmake any material acquisitions, dispositions or divestitures; or\nvi.\nenter into a sale, merger, consolidation or other change of control transaction.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the New LLC Agreement, the number and composition of the board of managers of Eureka Midstream Holdings may change over time based on MSI\u2019s percentage ownership interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings, or the failure of Eureka Midstream Holdings to satisfy certain performance standards on and after December 31, 2018. Currently, the board of managers of Eureka Midstream Holdings is composed of six members, three of whom are designated by us and three of whom are designated by MSI. Any decrease in the proportion of members that we are entitled to designate to the board of managers of Eureka Midstream Holdings will adversely affect our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Midstream Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nThe New LLC Agreement also allows MSI, as the holder of the Series A-2 Units, to initiate a \u201cQualified Public Offering\u201d of securities of Eureka Midstream Holdings at any time, so long as MSI holds at least a 20% of the total Class A Common Units in Eureka Midstream Holdings. A Qualified Public Offering means an underwritten initial public offering of securities of Eureka Midstream Holdings for which aggregate cash proceeds to be received by Eureka Midstream Holdings from such offering are at least $25 million and which results in equity securities of Eureka Midstream Holdings being listed on a national securities exchange.\nThe New LLC Agreement also contains transfer restrictions on Magnum Hunter\u2019s ownership interests in Eureka Midstream Holdings (subject to certain exceptions) and certain \u201cdrag-along\u201d and \u201ctag-along\u201d rights in favor of MSI.\nThese restrictive covenants, governance and other provisions may restrict the ability of Eureka Midstream Holdings to pursue its business strategies and our ability to exert influence over and manage the business and operations of Eureka Midstream Holdings and its subsidiaries.\nNGAS conducted part of its operations through private drilling partnerships, and, following our acquisition of NGAS in April 2011, we sponsored two private drilling partnerships. These drilling partnerships and their associated programs, including their dissolution, liquidation and winding up, subject us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nNGAS conducted a portion of its operations through private drilling partnerships with third parties. Following our acquisition of NGAS, we, as sponsor, completed two private drilling partnerships. Under our partnership structure, proceeds from the private placement of interests in each investment partnership, together with the sponsor\u2019s capital contribution, are contributed to a separate joint venture or \u201cprogram\u201d that the sponsor forms with that partnership to conduct drilling or property operations. All drilling partnerships and programs dissolved when MHP filed for bankruptcy on December 15, 2015. These NGAS historical drilling partnerships and our sponsored drilling partnerships, including the liquidation and winding up of these partnerships, expose us to additional risks that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. These additional risks include risks relating to potential challenges to tax positions taken by the investment partnerships, risks relating to disagreements with partners in the investment partnerships, especially with respect to the appropriate wind up of the drilling partnerships and programs, and risks relating to our general liability, in our capacity as general partner and liquidator of the investment partnerships and program partnerships.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental laws, which could adversely affect our business.\nExploration for and development, exploitation, production, processing, gathering, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including complex tax laws and environmental laws and regulations. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws, regulations or incremental taxes and fees, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations.\nMatters subject to regulation include oil and gas production and saltwater disposal operations and our processing, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials, discharge permits for drilling operations, spacing of wells, environmental protection and taxation. We could incur significant costs as a result of violations of or\nliabilities under environmental or other laws, including third-party claims for personal injuries and property damage, reclamation costs, remediation and clean-up costs resulting from oil spills and pipeline leaks and ruptures and discharges of hazardous materials, fines and sanctions, and other environmental damages.\nPursuant to the Clean Water Act (the \u201cCWA\u201d) and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States, including wetlands. The term \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d (\u201cWOTUS\u201d) has been broadly defined to include certain inland water bodies, including certain wetlands and intermittent streams. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers released a rule to revise the definition of WOTUS for all CWA programs, which went into effect in August 2015. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the WOTUS rule nationwide pending further action of the court. The new WOTUS rule could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the U.S., triggering substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements. On February 22, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that it has jurisdiction to hear the merits of a challenge to the new WOTUS rule. Failure to obtain or comply with permits or other CWA requirements could result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages.\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\u201cOPA\u201d), which amended the CWA, imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental clean-up and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. In addition, OPA establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. If a release into regulated waters occurs, we could be liable for clean-up costs, natural resources damages and public and private damages.\nAs a result of a settlement reached in 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on whether to list numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act over the next several years. The final designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities.\nThe Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System and the expected future expansion of these operations by Eureka Midstream are subject to additional governmental regulations.\nEureka Midstream is currently continuing the construction of the Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System, which provides or is expected to provide gas gathering services primarily in support of our Company-owned properties as well as other upstream producers\u2019 operations in West Virginia and Ohio. Eureka Midstream has completed certain sections of the pipeline and anticipates further expansion of the pipeline in the future, which expansion will be determined by various factors, including the prospects for commitments for gathering services from third-party producers, the availability of gas processing facilities, obtainment of rights-of-way, securing regulatory and governmental approvals, resolving any land management issues, completion of pipeline construction and connecting the pipeline to the producing sources of natural gas.\nThe construction, operation and maintenance of the Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond the control of Eureka Midstream and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. There can be no assurance that pipeline construction projects will be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, or at all. The Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System is also subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Eureka Midstream\u2019s business activities in many ways, including restricting the manner in which substances are disposed and discharged, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination, and requiring capital expenditures to comply with control requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and even criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances and wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, there exists the possibility that landowners and other third parties will file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of substances or wastes into the environment.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Eureka Midstream\u2019s business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products, air emissions related to operations, historical industry operations including releases of substances into the environment and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from the Eureka Midstream Gas Gathering System could subject Eureka Midstream to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Eureka Midstream may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s budget proposals for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 include proposals that would, among other things, eliminate or reduce certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective and whether such changes may apply retroactively. Although we are unable to predict whether any of these or other proposals will ultimately be enacted, the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Operations related to well stimulation, including hydraulic fracturing, are generally exempt from regulation under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program and have historically been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities. For example, in guidance released in 2014, the EPA asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel. In addition, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress, but has never passed. On May 9, 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period on the EPA\u2019s advance notice ended in September 2014, and a final notice of proposed rulemaking is expected in 2016. In addition, in April 2015, the EPA proposed regulations under the CWA to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing to publicly owned treatment works (the final rule is expected to be issued in 2016). In addition to rulemakings, increased scrutiny of the oil and natural gas industry may occur as a result of the EPA\u2019s FY2014-2016 National Enforcement Initiative, \u201cEnsuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws,\u201d through which the EPA will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environments.\nSeveral states have implemented, new regulations pertaining to hydraulic fracturing, including requirement to disclose chemicals used in connection therewith. For example, Texas enacted a law that requires hydraulic fracturing operators to disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing process on a well-by-well basis. There have also been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the state and local level to restrict oil and gas drilling operations in certain locations, including permitting, well construction or water withdrawal regulations. For example, in 2013, Texas adopted amended rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In addition, in November 2014, voters in the City of Denton, Texas, approved a local ordinance banning fracking. In May 2015, this local ordinance was preempted by state legislation. Texas also has water withdrawal restrictions allowing suspension of withdrawal rights in times of shortages. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater in 2011 and issued a draft assessment for public comment and peer review in June 2015; the assessment is expected to be finalized in 2016. The draft assessment concluded that hydraulic fracturing has not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking\nwater resources, but it does have the potential to impact drinking water resources; however, this conclusion has recently been criticized by the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015 governing hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands that replaces a prior draft of proposed rulemaking issued by the agency in May 2012. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that wells used in fracturing operations meet appropriate construction standards, and development of appropriate plans for managing flowback water that returns to the surface. However, a federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the rules at this time.\nTo our knowledge, there has been no contamination of potable drinking water, or citations or lawsuits claiming such contamination, arising from our hydraulic fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted various regulations addressing GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In 2010 the EPA adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, including one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. The stationary source final rule addresses the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit programs, pursuant to which these permit programs have been \u201ctailored\u201d to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. Those regulations were challenged in federal court. On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gas emissions alone cannot trigger an obligation to obtain an air permit. However, the Supreme Court upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources, concluding sources that trigger air permitting requirements based on their traditional criteria pollutant emissions must include a limit for greenhouse gases in their permit. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain sources, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. We are evaluating whether GHG emissions from our operations are subject to the GHG emissions reporting rule and expect to be able to comply with any applicable reporting obligations.\nIn 2012, the EPA issued regulations subjecting certain oil and gas operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAPS\u201d) programs that require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds, or VOC, emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air. The EPA also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators and pneumatic controllers, as well as natural gas gathering and boosting stations, processing plants, and compressor stations. In September 2015, the EPA proposed expanding the 2012 NSPS to impose volatile organic compound emissions limits on certain oil and natural gas operations that were previously unregulated, including hydraulically fractured oil wells. The proposed NSPS would limit natural gas emissions during well completions, impose new leak detection, and ongoing survey, repair, and recordkeeping requirements. The revised NSPS are expected to be finalized in June 2016. In addition, in October 2015, the EPA revised the existing National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent by reducing the standard to between 65 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8 hour primary and secondary standards protective of public health and public welfare.\nOn January 14, 2015, the White House announced a goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% from 2012 emission levels by 2025. In September 2015, the EPA proposed methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas sources, which the EPA expects to finalize in June 2016. This proposed rule targets specific emission sources in the oil and gas sector and imposes distinct requirements for each type of source. Under the proposed rule, oil and gas companies will have to, among other things, limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps, capture gas from the completion of fracked wells, find and repair leaks, and limit emissions from several types of equipment used at gas transmission compressor stations, including compressors and\npneumatic controllers. On March 10, 2016, the EPA announced that it will commence drafting proposed methane emission standards for existing oil and gas sources, although the substance and timing of such regulation remains unclear. To aid in the efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, in January 2016, the BLM also proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring and leaking on public lands.\nOn August 3, 2015, President Obama and the EPA announced the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent from 2015 levels by 2030; however, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the plan while it is being challenged in court. Furthermore, the U.S. is a party to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions. Also, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant added costs to reduce emissions of GHGs or could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate change that could have significant physical effect, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nWe must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our operations, which can be a costly and time consuming process, which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations.\nRegulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of specific permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration, development or production operations or our midstream operations. For example, we are often required to prepare and present to federal, state, local or foreign authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or development or production of oil or natural gas, pipeline construction, natural gas compression, treating or processing facilities or equipment and other associated equipment may have on the environment. Further, the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Accordingly, the permits we need may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.\nOur operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing human health and safety aspects of our operations, the release, discharge and disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling or pipeline construction activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to clean up or mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close waste pits and plug abandoned wells, or at off-site waste disposal locations; (v) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, and analogous state agencies (and, in some cases, private individuals) enforce these laws and regulations, which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations for failure to comply or the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. Some environmental laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose \u201cstrict liability\u201d for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs regardless of negligence or fault on the part of such person. Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas. In addition, state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations, such as plugging of abandoned wells. Changes in environmental laws, rules and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion, water management activities, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nDerivatives reform could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d), which was enacted in 2010, established a framework for the comprehensive regulation of the derivatives markets, including the swaps markets. Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), and the SEC have adopted regulations to implement this new\nregulatory regime, and continue to propose and adopt regulations, with the phase-in likely to continue for at least the next year. Among other things, entities that enter into derivatives will be subject to position limits for certain futures, options and swaps (under a pending regulatory proposal), and are currently subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements. There are also possible credit support requirements stemming from regulations that have not yet been finalized in their entirety. Although Dodd-Frank favors mandatory exchange trading and clearing, entities that enter into over-the-counter swaps to mitigate commercial risk, such as Magnum Hunter, may be exempt from the clearing mandate where their positions qualify for exemption under existing CFTC regulations. Whether we are required to post collateral with respect to our derivative transactions will depend on our counterparty type, final rules to be adopted by the CFTC, SEC and the bank regulators, and how our activities fit within those rules. While rules proposed by the CFTC and federal banking regulators would allow for non-cash collateral and exemptions from margin for non-financial companies using swaps to hedge risk, the rules are not final and therefore some uncertainty remains. Many entities, including our counterparties, are now subject to significantly increased regulatory oversight which is expected to include, under regulations that are not yet final, minimum capital requirements. These changes could materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we are required to post cash or other collateral with respect to our derivative positions, we could be required to divert resources (including cash) away from our core businesses, which could limit our ability to execute strategic hedges and thereby result in increased commodity price uncertainty and volatility in our cash flow. Although it is difficult to predict the aggregate effect of this regulatory regime once it is entirely in place, the new regime could increase our costs, limit our ability to protect against risks and reduce liquidity, all of which could impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions we pursue present risks.\nOur growth has been attributable in part to acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage, either directly as asset acquisitions or indirectly through the acquisition of companies. We expect to continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms we consider favorable. However, we cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. In addition, we compete against other companies for acquisitions, and we cannot assure you that we will successfully acquire any material property interests. Further, we cannot assure you that future acquisitions by us will be integrated successfully into our operations or will be profitable.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage requires an assessment of numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\ni.\nestimated recoverable reserves;\nii.\nexploration and development potential;\niii.\nfuture oil and natural gas prices;\niv.\noperating costs; and\nv.\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The resulting assessments are inexact and their accuracy uncertain, and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies within the time frame required to complete the transactions. Inspections may not always be performed on every well or of every property, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is made.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may be substantially different in operating and geologic characteristics, geographic location or regulatory environment than our existing properties. While our core current operations are primarily focused in the West Virginia and Ohio regions, we may pursue acquisitions of properties located in other geographic areas.\nAcquisitions may not be successful, may substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and may create integration difficulties.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired and in the future may continue to acquire businesses or assets we believe complement our existing core operations and business plans. We may not be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations or achieve the desired profitability from such acquisitions. These acquisitions may require substantial capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional indebtedness which may change significantly our capitalization and results of operations. Further, these acquisitions could result in:\ni.\npost-closing discovery of material undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business or assets, title or other defects with respect to acquired assets, discrepancies or errors in furnished financial statements or other information or breaches of representations made by the sellers;\nii.\nthe unexpected loss of key employees or customers from acquired businesses;\niii.\ndifficulties resulting from our integration of the operations, systems and management of the acquired business; and\niv.\nan unexpected diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other operations.\nIf acquisitions are unsuccessful or result in unanticipated events, such as the post-closing discovery of the matters described above, or if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations, such acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nThere are risks in connection with dispositions we have made and intend to pursue.\nWe have made and continue to pursue dispositions of assets and properties, both to increase our cash position (or reduce our indebtedness) and to redirect our resources toward our core operations or for other purposes, either through asset sales or the sale of stock of one or more of our subsidiaries. We continue to pursue dispositions of non-core assets. However, we cannot assure you that suitable disposition opportunities will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to complete such dispositions on favorable terms. Further, we cannot assure you that our use of the net proceeds from such dispositions will result in improved results of operations.\nAs with a successful acquisition, the successful disposition of assets and properties requires an assessment of numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:\ni.\nestimated recoverable reserves;\nii.\nexploration and development potential;\niii.\nfuture oil and natural gas prices;\niv.\noperating costs;\nv.\npotential seller indemnification obligations;\nvi.\nthe creditworthiness of the buyer; and\nvii.\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nIn connection with such an assessment, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. The resulting assessments are inexact and their accuracy uncertain, and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential benefits associated with a property, nor will it necessarily permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies within the time frame required to complete the transactions. Additionally, significant dispositions can change the nature of our operations and business.\nRisks Related to Our Common and Preferred Stock\nThe shares of our existing common and preferred stock are expected to be canceled in our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common and preferred stock in our capital structure. As a result, in accordance with our Plan, the existing shares of our common and preferred stock are expected to be canceled in our Chapter 11 proceedings and are not expected to be entitled to any recovery. Any trading in shares of our common and preferred stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of shares of our common and preferred stock. On the Effective Date, these securities will be canceled and removed from further trading by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.", "PERMNO": 91419, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRMR"}
