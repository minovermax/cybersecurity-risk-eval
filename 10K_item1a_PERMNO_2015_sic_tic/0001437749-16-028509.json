{"cik": "1040792", "company": "Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nThe continued uncertain economic environment may adversely affect our business.\nSpending on IT consulting and analytics services is largely discretionary and will decline during economic downturns or periods of economic uncertainty when the Company\u2019s clients are operating under reduced budgets, including during the current period. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from sales to clients in the financial services, banking and insurance industries. Many of the Company\u2019s major clients in the financial services industry came under significant financial pressure as a result of the recent economic crisis. If the period of economic uncertainty continues or if the economic environment worsens it could further erode the Company\u2019s ability to sell future projects.\nWe rely on a concentrated client base for much of our revenue.\nWe rely on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our top four clients accounted for 90% and 88% respectively of our revenue. If we were to lose any of these clients, we cannot assure you that they could be replaced quickly or at all. Our loss of any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock was traded on 239 days during 2015 and may be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to variations in quarterly results of operations and other factors, including financings, technological innovations and general economic or market conditions. For example, the closing price of our common stock during 2015 was as low as $1.31 and as high as $4.80. Stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in the recent past. This volatility had a substantial effect on the market price of many technology companies that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. This volatility may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOur industry is subject to rapid change.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, evolving distribution channels and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our services as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop information technology solutions to meet client expectations, and offer services and solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing client preferences. If we are unable to keep up with technological changes and changes in industry standards, our business, reputation and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive.\nThe market for IT consulting and analytic services is intensely competitive, affected by rapid technological advances and includes a large number of competitors. Our competitors include the current or former consulting divisions of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, major offshore outsourcing companies, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software development firms, management consulting firms, divisions of large computer hardware and software companies, and niche providers of IT services. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Competition imposes significant pricing pressures on us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business and financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel from our day-to-day operations. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements.\nStatutory non-compliances in our India subsidiary company - Helios and Matheson Global Services Pvt Limited\nIn March 2015, there was a casual vacancy in the board caused by resignation of one of the 2 Board members of our 99.99% owned Indian subsidiary, Helios and Matheson Global Services Private Limited (\u2018HMGS\u2019). In the absence of a properly re-constituted Board, there was non-compliance with regard to certain provisions of Indian Companies Act, 2013. These non-compliances were with respect to conduct of Board meetings, appointment of a new auditor, scheduling of Annual Shareholder\u2019s Meeting, and consequently filing of certain returns with the authorities.\nIn order to regain compliance with the Indian Companies Act, 2013 and regularize the operations of HMGS, the Company called for a Special Shareholders\u2019 Meeting and appointed 2 new Directors and re-constituted the Board, as also appointed Statutory Auditors. The amount of penalty which HMGS might face is not likely to have any material impact on the consolidated results of the Company, and HMGS is taking all necessary steps to become fully compliant with the Indian Company Act 2013 as soon as practically possible however, HMGS faces risk of certain penalties being levied on it for delay in filing certain statutory returns.\nNASDAQ Continued Listing Standards Compliance:\nOn November 20, 2015, the Company received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) indicating that, as of September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $1,822,125 did not meet the $2,500,000 minimum stockholders\u2019 equity required by NASDAQ to maintain continued listing, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), and that as of November 20, 2015 the Company did not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations.\nUnder NASDAQ rules, the Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. On January 4, 2016, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance by May 18, 2016 (the \u201cPlan\u201d). On January 13, 2016, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ accepting the Plan, provided that a certain interim condition was satisfied. On March 7, 2016, the Company satisfied the interim condition of the Plan. Accordingly, the Company may have until May 18, 2016 to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement. However, during that time, the Company may be subject to delisting proceedings for any other qualifications failures.\nOn March 1, 2016, the Company received written notice (the \u201cMVPHS Notification Letter\u201d) from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that the Company no longer satisfies the minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(5) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(5) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum MVPHS of $1 million, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D) provides that a failure to meet the minimum MVPHS requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the minimum MVPHS of the Company\u2019s publicly held shares for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the MVPHS Notification Letter, the Company no longer meets the minimum MVPHS requirement.\nThe MVPHS Notification Letter states that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until August 29, 2016, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(5). To regain compliance, the Company\u2019s MVPHS must reach at least $1 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.\nThe Company is currently considering available options to resolve its compliance with the minimum MVPHS requirement and regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rules.", "PERMNO": 85320, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HMNY"}
