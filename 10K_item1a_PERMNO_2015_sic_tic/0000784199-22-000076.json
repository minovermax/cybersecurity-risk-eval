{"cik": "784199", "company": "ARTIVION, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.Risks Relating to Our Business\nOur business involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, the risks discussed below. These risks should be carefully considered together with the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Our failure to adequately anticipate or address these risks and uncertainties may have a material, adverse impact on our business, reputation, revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or knowable to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business.\nBusiness and Economic Risks\nCOVID-19, and similar outbreaks, could have a material, adverse impact on us.\nSince early 2020, businesses, communities, and governments worldwide have taken, and continue to take, a wide range of actions to mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented impact on the global economy. Hospitals and other healthcare providers have adopted differing approaches to address the surge and resurgence of COVID-19 cases, including their impact on healthcare workers, such as postponing elective and non-emergent procedures, restricting access to their facilities, cancelling elective procedures, or re-allocating scarce resources to some critically ill patients. Although some areas have seen a decline in COVID-19 cases, the potential for additional impact from new variants of COVID-19 and longer than anticipated timelines for widespread therapeutic and vaccine availability and acceptance remain. These conditions have and could continue to impact our activities, including:\n\uf0b7Our product sales. Certain regions experienced an impact on revenues in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to COVID-19\u2019s impact on procedure volumes, including an impact on procedure volumes due in part to COVID-19-related healthcare staffing shortages, we have begun to observe additional downstream effects on our business, including an increase in delays or difficulty in collecting certain outstanding receivables, particularly with certain governmental payors in regions heavily impacted by COVID-19. The extent to which our financial performance will be impacted by the pandemic in 2022 and beyond will depend largely on future developments, including changes in hospital utilization rates and staffing, the prevalence and severity of new variants, global availability and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness against variants, and the prevalence of public and private vaccine mandates. COVID-19\u2019s continued or increased impact on our financial performance may also increase the risks we face with respect to managing our indebtedness.\n\uf0b7Our business operations. In 2020 we took several steps to address the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, cash consumption, and operations, including reducing expenditures and delaying investments. The reductions and delays we adopted could adversely impact our business operations or delay our recovery from the effects of the pandemic. Although we have begun to scale back many of these steps in most geographies, the COVID-19 virus and its variants remain highly contagious and our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and its variants among our employees, including our key personnel, and to protect our supply chain, may not succeed. COVID-19 also continues to impact our business partners, including the various regulators and notified bodies that we rely on, which increases the regulatory risks we face, and specifically, the risks we face with respect to timely review and approval of new and renewal certifications, clearances, and approvals for our products.\n\uf0b7Our manufacturing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain; the pandemic\u2019s impact on workforces, global mobility, material availability, demand, and shipping and reorder time and reliability has reportedly continued or worsened in many cases. Although we have yet to experience any material effects of this impact on our supply chain or operations, we face an increasing risk that upstream disruptions may occur. Risks relating to the lingering effects of global supply chain disruptions may even continue after COVID-19\u2019s risk as a global pandemic has subsided.\n\uf0b7Our workforce. As some global economies have begun to emerge from the COVID-19 downturn, the expiration of COVID-related hiring freezes, increased opportunities for remote work, the Great Resignation and increasing compensation pressure have resulted in a war for talent and an unprecedent number of career changes. The resulting worker shortages at all levels have impacted supply chains and distribution channels and employers\u2019 ability to adequately staff their operations. This has impacted not only our own ability to attract and retain employees, but also the ability of our customers who face increasing staffing pressures throughout their healthcare organizations.\n\uf0b7Our research and development projects. In 2020 and parts of 2021 we reduced spending on research and development projects, including clinical research projects. These reductions could adversely impact future revenue, and additional reductions in spending could be implemented, further impacting future revenue. In addition, our ability to conduct our ongoing research and development projects in markets that are affected by COVID-19 has been, and could continue to be, adversely impacted. Enrollment and timelines for our clinical trials have been, and might continue to be, impacted as healthcare providers reprioritize resources, address staffing shortages, and limit access to healthcare facilities or as patients decline to participate or are hesitant to voluntarily visit healthcare facilities. In addition, staffing shortages and COVID-19-related impacts on government and regulatory agencies have slowed and might continue to slow timelines for regulatory actions, including approvals.\nIf COVID-19 or its variants continue to spread, if efforts to contain COVID-19 or its variants continue or are unsuccessful, if we experience new outbreaks of COVID-19 in areas previously successful in containing its spread, if staffing shortages impact us, governmental or regulatory bodies, or our customers, if vaccine mandates become more prevalent, or if COVID-19, its variants, or disruptions to the global supply chain impact our supply chain or employee productivity, it could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. The nature and extent of these developments are highly uncertain and unpredictable and may vary greatly by region. These adverse developments or a prolonged period of uncertainty could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks due to our global expansion.\nOur international operations subject us to a number of risks, which may vary significantly from the risks we face in our US operations, including:\n\uf0b7Greater difficulties and costs associated with staffing, establishing and maintaining internal controls, managing foreign operations and distributor relationships, and selling directly to customers;\n\uf0b7Broader exposure to corruption and expanded compliance obligations, including under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Law, local anti-corruption laws, Office of Foreign Asset Control administered sanction programs, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, and other emerging corruption and data privacy regulations;\n\uf0b7Overlapping and potentially conflicting, or unexpected changes in, international legal and regulatory requirements or reimbursement policies and programs;\n\uf0b7Longer and more expensive collection cycles in certain countries, particularly those in which our primary customers are government-funded hospitals;\n\uf0b7Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the Euro as compared to the US Dollar;\n\uf0b7Potential adverse financial impact and negative erosion of our operating profit margin over time due to increasing inflationary pressures, particularly through our supply chain; our exposure may be increased through our limited ability to raise prices and through global expansion where business occurs with, or pricing is set directly by, government entities, or we are party to long term pricing agreements with governments or local distributors, impacting our ability to pass on rising costs;\n\uf0b7Potential adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures; and\n\uf0b7Potential adverse financial and regulatory consequences resulting from the exit of the UK from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nWe operate in highly competitive market segments, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies and tissue service providers with greater resources and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive and affected by new product introductions and activities of other industry participants. We face intense competition in virtually all of our product lines. A significant percentage of market revenues from competitive products are generated by Baxter International, Inc.; Ethicon (a Johnson & Johnson Company); Medtronic, Inc.; Abbott Laboratories; Edwards Lifesciences Corp.; C.R. Bard, Inc., a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company; Integra Life Sciences Holdings; LifeNet; CORCYM (completed acquisition of the LivaNova heart valve business in June 2021); Anteris Technologies, Inc.; Aziyo Biologics; Cook Medical; Gore & Associates; Terumo Aortic Corp.; LeMaitre Vascular, Inc.; Maquet, Inc.; Pfizer, Inc.; and BioCer Entwicklungs-GmbH. Several of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including:\n\uf0b7Greater financial and other resources for research and development, commercialization, acquisitions, and litigation and to weather the impacts of COVID-19 and increased workforce competition;\n\uf0b7Greater name recognition as well as more recognizable trademarks for products similar to products that we sell;\n\uf0b7More established record of obtaining and maintaining regulatory product clearances or approvals;\n\uf0b7More established relationships with healthcare providers and payors;\n\uf0b7Lower cost of goods sold or preservation costs; and\n\uf0b7Larger direct sales forces and more established distribution networks.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from tissue preservation services and are subject to a variety of risks affecting them.\nTissue preservation services are a significant source of our revenues, and as such, we face risks if we are unable to:\n\uf0b7Source sufficient quantities of some human tissue or address potential excess supply of others. We rely primarily upon the efforts of third-parties to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue. Factors beyond our control such as supply, regulatory changes, negative publicity concerning methods of tissue recovery or disease transmission from donated tissue, or public opinion of the donor process as well as our own reputation in the industry can negatively impact the supply of tissue;\n\uf0b7Compete effectively, as we may be unable to capitalize on our clinical advantages or our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, pricing, back-office automation, marketing, and sourcing; or\n\uf0b7Mitigate sufficiently the risk that tissue can become contaminated during processing; that processed tissue cannot be end-sterilized and hence carries an inherent risk of infection or disease transmission or that our quality controls can eliminate that risk.\nAs an example of this risk, in the fourth quarter of 2020 we became aware that a supplier shipped to us a lot of saline solution that we use in our tissue processing that contained some contamination. The contamination was identified by our routine quality controls. While we were able to mitigate the impact of this contamination through our own efforts and additional testing that was reviewed with the FDA, the contaminated solution impacted a small percentage of the tissue processed with this lot of solution, requiring us to write-off approximately $826,000 in contaminated tissues in the fourth quarter of 2020. The written off and temporarily quarantined tissue impacted our ability to fully meet demand for certain tissues and sizes in the fourth quarter of 2020, the first quarter of 2021, and to a lesser extent the second quarter of 2021. Our inability to meet some demand for tissue in the third quarter resulted in part from a shortage of trained staff capable of meeting the increased demand for releasing this quarantined tissue. See also, Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Operational Risks- We are dependent on our specialized workforce.\u201d\nIn addition, US and foreign governmental authorities have adopted laws and regulations that restrict tissue preservation services. Any of these laws or regulations could change, including becoming more restrictive or our interpretation of them could be challenged by governmental authorities.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from BioGlue and are subject to a variety of related risks.\nBioGlue Surgical Adhesive (\u201cBioGlue\u201d) is a significant source of our revenues, and as such, any risk adversely affecting our BioGlue products or business would likely be material to our financial results. We face the following risks related to BioGlue:\n\uf0b7Competing effectively with our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, supply chain, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\uf0b7We may be unable to obtain approval to commercialize BioGlue in certain non US countries as fast as our competitors do of their products or at all. We also may not be able to capitalize on new BioGlue approvals, including for new indications, in non US countries;\n\uf0b7BioGlue contains a bovine blood protein. Animal-based products are subject to increased scrutiny from the public and regulators, who may seek to impose additional regulations, regulatory hurdles or product bans in certain countries on such products; BioGlue is a mature product and other companies may use the inventions disclosed in expired BioGlue patents to develop and make competing products; and\n\uf0b7BioGlue faces potential adverse regulatory consequences resulting from the exit of the UK from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit.\u201d See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-Industry Risks- Our products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks.\u201d\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from aortic stents and stent grafts and are subject to a variety of related risks.\nAortic stents and stent grafts are a significant source of our revenues, and as such, any risk adversely affecting aortic stents and stent grafts would likely be material to our financial results. We face the following aortic stents and stent grafts related risks based on our ability to:\n\uf0b7Compete effectively with our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, supply chain, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\uf0b7Develop innovative, high quality, and in-demand aortic repair products;\n\uf0b7Respond adequately to enhanced regulatory requirements and enforcement activities, and particularly, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals and renewals globally;\n\uf0b7Meet demand for aortic stents and stent grafts as we seek to expand our business globally; and\n\uf0b7Maintain a productive working relationship with our Works Council in Germany.\nWe are significantly dependent on our revenues from On-X products and are subject to a variety of related risks.\nOn-X products are a significant source of our revenues, and as such, any risk adversely affecting our On-X products or business would likely be material to our financial results. We face risks based on our ability to:\n\uf0b7Compete effectively with some of our major competitors, as they may have advantages over us in terms of cost structure, supply chain, pricing, sales force footprint, and brand recognition;\n\uf0b7Take market share in the mechanical heart valve market based on the FDA\u2019s approved lower International Normalized Ratio (\u201cINR\u201d) indication or complete the associated FDA mandated post-approval studies;\n\uf0b7Address clinical trial data or changes in technology that may reduce the demand for mechanical heart valves, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or \u201cTAVR\u201d devices;\n\uf0b7Manage risks associated with less favorable contract terms for On-X products on consignment at hospitals;\n\uf0b7Respond adequately to enhanced international regulatory requirements or enforcement activities; and\n\uf0b7Receive timely renewal certifications in certain markets.\nContinued fluctuation of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar could materially, adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our foreign product revenues are denominated in Euros and, as such, are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. In addition, a portion of our dollar-denominated and euro-denominated product sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into US Dollars or Euros in order to purchase these products. We also have balances, such as cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. Fluctuations in exchange rates of Euros or other local currencies in relation to the US Dollar could materially reduce our future revenues as compared to the comparable prior periods. Should this occur, it could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur charges resulting from acquisitions, restructurings, and integrations may materially, adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nWe account for the completion of acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required by purchase accounting such as:\n\uf0b7We may incur added amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of some acquired intangible assets;\n\uf0b7We may incur additional depreciation expense as a result of recording purchased tangible assets;\n\uf0b7We may be required to incur material charges relating to any impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;\n\uf0b7Cost of sales may increase temporarily if acquired inventory is recorded at fair market value;\n\uf0b7If acquisition consideration consists of earn-outs, our earnings may be affected by changes in estimates of future contingent consideration; or\n\uf0b7Earnings may be affected by transaction and integration costs, which are expensed immediately.\nAs an example of this risk, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we fully impaired the value of the Endospan Option and fully wrote-down the value of the Endospan Loan, primarily driven by a decrease in forecasted operating results. This impairment, and other potential risks like those mentioned above, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nOperational Risks\nWe are heavily dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide quality products.\nThe materials and supplies used in our product manufacturing and tissue processing are subject to regulatory requirements and oversight. If materials or supplies used in our processes fail to meet these requirements or are subject to regulatory enforcement action, they may have to be scrapped, or our products or tissues could be rejected during or after processing, recalled, or rejected by customers. In these cases, we may have to immediately scrap raw or in process materials or expense the costs of manufacturing or preservation.\nAs an example of this risk, in the fourth quarter of 2020 we became aware that a supplier shipped to us a lot of saline solution that we use in our tissue processing that contained some contamination. The contamination was identified by our routine quality controls. While we were able to mitigate the impact of this contamination through our own efforts and additional testing that was reviewed with the FDA, the contaminated solution impacted a small percentage of the tissue processed with this lot of solution, requiring us to write-off those contaminated tissues in the fourth quarter of 2020 and impacting our ability to fully meet demand for certain tissues and sizes in the fourth quarter of 2020, the first quarter of 2021, and to a lesser extent the second quarter of 2021.\nIn addition, if these materials or supplies or changes to them do not receive regulatory approval or are recalled, if the related suppliers and/or their facilities are shut down temporarily or permanently, for any reason, or if the related suppliers are otherwise unable or unwilling to supply us, we may not have sufficient materials or supplies to manufacture our products or process tissues. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our products or to provide additional manufacturing capacity for some products. If these contract manufacturers fail to meet our quality standards or other requirements or if they are unable or unwilling to supply the products, we may not be able to meet demand for these products. Our ability to fully recover all possible losses from these suppliers and contract manufacturers may have practical limitations imposed by factors like industry standard contractual terms or the financial resources of the adverse party. As a further example of this risk, our supplier of TMR handpieces was informed in the fourth quarter of 2021 that the sole-source manufacturer of tubing used in the handpiece assembly had gone out of business, requiring us to work with our supplier to identify and qualify a new supplier before a disruption in handpiece availability occurs.\nFinally, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain; the pandemic\u2019s impact on workforces, global mobility, material availability, demand, and shipping and reorder time and reliability has reportedly continued or worsened in many cases. Although we have yet to experience any material effects of this impact on our supply chain or operations, we face an increasing risk that upstream disruptions may occur. Risks relating to the lingering effects of global supply chain disruptions may even continue after COVID-19\u2019s risk as a global pandemic has subsided.\nWe are dependent on single and sole-source suppliers and single facilities.\nSome of the materials, supplies, and services used in our product manufacturing and tissue processing, as well as some of our products, are sourced from single- or sole-source suppliers. As a result, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with those suppliers may be limited, and if those suppliers experience operational, financial, quality, or regulatory difficulties, or if those suppliers and/or their facilities refuse to supply us or cease operations temporarily or permanently, or if those suppliers take unreasonable business positions, we could be forced to cease product manufacturing or tissue processing until the suppliers resume operations, until alternative suppliers could be identified and qualified, or permanently if the suppliers do not resume operations and no alternative suppliers could be identified and qualified. We could also be forced to purchase alternative materials, supplies, or services with unfavorable terms due to diminished bargaining power.\nAs an example of these risks, in 2019 we lost our supply of handpieces for cardiac laser therapy resulting from a manufacturing location change at our supplier that ultimately required a Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) supplement and FDA approval before handpiece manufacturing and distribution could resume. Even though the FDA approved the PMA-S, our supplier has been unable to fully resume production due to factors outside of our control. Due to these and other supplier issues, we had virtually no supply of handpieces during the first three quarters of 2021. Although handpiece supply resumed on a limited basis during the last quarter of 2021, we remain dependent on a sole-source manufacturer for these handpieces.\nBy way of additional non-limiting examples, our BioGlue product has three main product components: bovine protein, a cross linker, and a molded plastic resin delivery device. The bovine protein and cross linker are obtained from a small number of qualified suppliers. The delivery devices are manufactured by a single supplier, using resin supplied by a single supplier. We purchase grafts for our On-X AAP from a single supplier and various other components for our On-X valves come from single source suppliers.\nOur preservation services business and our ability to supply needed tissues is dependent upon donation of tissues from human donors by donor families. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by OPOs and tissue banks. We must rely on the OPOs and tissue banks that we work with to educate the public on the need for donation, to foster a willingness to donate tissue, to follow our donor screening and procurement procedures, and to send donated tissue to us. We have active relationships with 59 OPOs and tissue banks throughout the US. As with any vendor, we believe these relationships with our OPOs are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides us with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market. We also use various raw materials, including medicines and solutions, in our tissue processing. Some of these raw materials are manufactured by single suppliers or by a small group of suppliers.\nOur endovascular stent graft systems consist of two main product components: the stent graft and the delivery system. The stent graft is manufactured out of several different raw materials that are manufactured by JOTEC and various external suppliers, including single suppliers. The delivery systems are manufactured by JOTEC from several different raw materials with different processing techniques. Primary processes are the assembly of injection molded parts and machine drilled parts, suturing of stent grafts, processing of Nitinol, and weaving of textiles. Our conventional polyester grafts consist of two main product components: polyester fabric and collagen coating. The polyester fabric is manufactured by JOTEC out of a few different yarns that are supplied by an external supplier. The collagen suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a collagenous tissue that is supplied by a single supplier. Our conventional ePTFE grafts are manufactured by JOTEC out of various raw materials supplied by several suppliers. For some products the ePTFE grafts are heparin coated. For these products, the heparin suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a heparin solution that is also supplied by an external supplier.\nWe also conduct all of our own manufacturing operations at three facilities: Austin, Texas for On-X products, Hechingen, Germany for JOTEC Products, and Kennesaw, Georgia for all other products and services. The NEXUS product is solely manufactured by Endospan in Herzelia, Israel, and the AMDS product is solely manufactured by a supplier in Charlotte, North Carolina. If one of these facilities ceases operations temporarily or permanently, for any reason including a pandemic or climate change related event, our business could be substantially disrupted.\nAlthough we work diligently to maintain adequate inventories of raw materials, components, supplies, subassemblies, and finished goods, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid all disruptions to our global supply chain, or disruptions to our sterilization or distribution networks. Any of these disruptions could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues, reputation, or profitability.\nWe are dependent on our specialized workforce.\nOur business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our specialized workforce, including key personnel, qualified personnel with medical device and tissue processing experience, and senior management with experience in the medical device or tissue processing space, some of whom would be difficult to replace. Our field-based workforce is increasingly being subject to public and private vaccine mandates, including mandates without exception, which may impact unvaccinated personnel\u2019s ability to fulfill or stay in their roles. Our business and future operating results, including production at our manufacturing and tissue processing facilities, also depend in significant part on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, operations, processing, marketing, sales, and support personnel. Our primary facilities are in Kennesaw, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Hechingen, Germany, where the supply of qualified medical device and tissue processing and other personnel is limited, competition for such personnel is significant, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in attracting or retaining them. We face risks if we lose any key employees to other employers or due to severe illness, death, or retirement, if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately, or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees. This risk was exacerbated during 2021, and is expected to continue, as the competition for talent in the medical device industry and in the workforce generally has intensified substantially. As some global economies have begun to emerge from the COVID-19 downturn, the expiration of COVID-19 related hiring freezes, the Great Resignation, increased opportunities for remote work, and increasing compensation pressure have resulted in a war for talent and an unprecedent number of career changes. The resulting competition and worker shortages at all levels have impacted supply chains and distribution channels and our ability to attract and retain the specialized workforce necessary for our business and operations.\nWe continue to evaluate expansion through acquisitions of, or licenses with, investments in, and distribution arrangements with, other companies or technologies, which may carry significant risks.\nOne of our growth strategies is to pursue select acquisitions, licensing, or distribution rights with companies or technologies that complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure. In connection with one or more of these transactions, we may:\n\uf0b7Issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest;\n\uf0b7Use cash we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\uf0b7Incur debt, including on terms that could be unfavorable to us or debt we might be unable to repay;\n\uf0b7Structure the transaction resulting in unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in basis for the assets acquired;\n\uf0b7Be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction; or\n\uf0b7Assume material unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nWe may not realize all the anticipated benefits of our business development activities.\nAs part of our efforts to drive growth by pursuing select acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities that are aligned to our objectives and complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure or to divest non-core product lines, we have completed several transactions in recent years and may pursue similar additional transactions in the future. Examples of these activities include the following:\n\uf0b7On December 1, 2017 we acquired JOTEC AG, a Swiss entity that we converted to JOTEC GmbH and subsequently merged with our Swiss acquisition entity, Jolly Buyer Acquisition GmbH and its subsidiaries;\n\uf0b7On September 11, 2019 we entered into various agreements with Endospan, Ltd. (\u201cEndospan\u201d), an Israeli medical device manufacturer (the \u201cEndospan Transaction\u201d). The Endospan Transaction included an exclusive distribution agreement for the NEXUS stent graft system (\u201cNEXUS\u201d) in Europe; an agreement (\u201cEndospan Loan\u201d) for a secured loan from Artivion to Endospan; and a security purchase option agreement for Artivion to purchase all the then outstanding Endospan securities from Endospan\u2019s existing securityholders upon FDA approval of NEXUS;\n\uf0b7On September 2, 2020 we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Ascyrus Medical LLC (\u201cAscyrus\u201d), the developer of the Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (\u201cAMDS\u201d);\n\uf0b7On July 28, 2021 we entered into various agreements with Baxter International, Inc. (\u201cBaxter\u201d) and Starch Medical, Inc. (\u201cSMI\u201d) related to the sale of our PerClot assets to Baxter and the termination of our existing material agreements with SMI.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, growth prospects, cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of these transactions depends on a number of factors including our ability to:\n\uf0b7Leverage our global infrastructure to sell and cross-market the acquired products;\n\uf0b7Drive adoption of NEXUS and AMDS in the European and other markets, including our ability to manage the substantial requirements for NEXUS procedures for product training, implant support, and proctoring;\n\uf0b7Bring acquired products to the US market, including AMDS and the JOTEC Products;\n\uf0b7Harness the JOTEC product pipeline and research and development capabilities;\n\uf0b7Obtain regulatory approvals in relevant markets, including our ability to timely obtain FDA PMA for PerClot as contemplated under the terms of the Baxter Transaction, to obtain Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene Mark (\u201cCE Mark\u201d) product certification for pipeline products, and to obtain or maintain certification for pipeline and current products at all;\n\uf0b7Execute on development and clinical trial timelines for acquired products;\n\uf0b7Manage global inventories, including our ability to manage inventories for product lines with large numbers of product configurations and manage manufacturing and demand cycles to avoid excess inventory obsolescence due to shelf life expiration, particularly for processed tissues and aortic stent and stent graft products;\n\uf0b7Carry, service, and manage significant debt and repayment obligations; and\n\uf0b7Manage the unforeseen risks and uncertainties related to these transactions, including any related to intellectual property rights.\nAdditionally, our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, growth prospects, synergies, and other benefits of the Endospan Transaction depends on a number of additional factors including Endospan\u2019s ability to: (a) comply with the Endospan Loan and other debt obligations, and avoid an event of default; (b) successfully commercialize NEXUS, raise capital and drive adoption in markets in and outside of Europe; (c) meet demand for NEXUS; (d) meet quality and regulatory requirements; (e) manage any intellectual property risks and uncertainties associated with NEXUS; (f) obtain FDA approval of NEXUS; and (g) develop NEXUS product improvements to meet competitive threats and physician demand. As an example of this risk, the forecasted operating results related to NEXUS decreased in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in an impairment in the value of the Endospan Option, and a full write-down the value of the Endospan Loan, reflecting decreased expectations with respect to the anticipated benefits of the Endospan Transaction.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy. The benefits of these transactions may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could negatively impact our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our common stock. In addition, if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction, we could experience an interruption or loss of momentum in our existing business activities.\nWe may not realize all the anticipated benefits of our corporate rebranding and it may result in unanticipated disruptions to our on-going business.\nIn order to reflect our evolution to focus on providing innovative technologies to surgeons who treat patients with aortic disease, we changed our name to Artivion, Inc., effective January 18, 2022 (the \u201cCorporate Rebrand\u201d). The Corporate Rebrand also involved the adoption of a new ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange, \u201cAORT.\u201d We may face unanticipated disruptions to our business arising from the Corporate Rebrand, and it may expose us to additional risks, including:\n\uf0b7Disruptions to our day-to-day business operations including disruptions to our ability to receive or our customers\u2019 ability to make timely payments;\n\uf0b7Disruptions to access to certain markets or segments due to delays or other issues with regulatory approvals or updates arising from the Corporate Rebrand;\n\uf0b7Unanticipated delays or other impact on our pending regulatory applications or clinical trials arising from the Corporate Rebrand;\n\uf0b7Confusion within the marketplace, particularly with multiple points of contact in our downstream product flow involving purchasing and accounts payable departments and end users;\n\uf0b7Intellectual property risks associated with the adoption of a new corporate identity and trade dress; and\n\uf0b7Loss of goodwill associated with our legacy brands, including our CryoLife and JOTEC brands that will become less prominent over time.\nThe Corporate Rebrand involved significant financial and resource investment and will continue to do so as we complete our global brand transitions over the coming years. The anticipated benefits of the Corporate Rebrand may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframe, without additional near or long-term investment, or at all. Any of these factors could negatively impact our revenues, earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Corporate Rebrand, and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon a combination of sophisticated information technology systems as well as traditional recordkeeping to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including, but not limited to, information about our business, financial information, personal data, intellectual property, and, in some instances, patient data). Our information technology and information security systems and records are potentially vulnerable to security breaches, service interruptions, data loss, or malicious attacks resulting from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, vendors, or other third parties. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented remote work arrangements for some employees, and those employees may use outside technology and systems that are vulnerable to security breaches, service interruptions, data loss or malicious attacks, including by third parties.\nAs an example of these risks, on November 1, 2019 we were notified that we had become a victim of a business e-mail compromise. During the fourth quarter of 2019, a company email account was compromised by a third-party impersonator and a payment intended for one of our US vendors in the amount of $2.6 million was fraudulently re-directed into an individual bank account controlled by this third-party impersonator. Our cyber-insurance covered all but $25,000 of the unrecovered losses from this compromise.\nWhile we have invested, and continue to invest, in our information technology and information security systems and employee information security training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all security breaches, service interruptions, or data losses. We have limited cyber-insurance coverage that may not cover all possible events, and this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Any security breaches, service interruptions, or data losses could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, or in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they may use to trade in our securities.\nIndustry Risks\nOur products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks.\nThe commercialization of medical devices and processing and distribution of human tissues are highly complex and subject to significant global quality and regulatory risks and as such, we face the following risks:\n\uf0b7Our products and tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, patient injury, which has exposed, and could in the future expose, us to liability claims that could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny;\n\uf0b7Our manufacturing and tissue processing operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny, inspections and enforcement actions, and regulatory agencies could require us to change or modify our operations or take other action, such as issuing product recalls or holds;\n\uf0b7Regulatory agencies could reclassify, re-evaluate, or suspend our clearances or approvals, or fail, or decline to, issue or reissue our clearances or approvals that are necessary to sell our products and distribute tissues;\n\uf0b7Regulatory and quality requirements are subject to change, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or distribute tissues; and\n\uf0b7Adverse publicity associated with our products, processed tissues, or our industry could lead to a decreased use of our products or tissues, increased regulatory scrutiny, or product or tissue processing liability claims.\nFurther, on May 25, 2017 the European Union adopted a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) (\u201cMDR\u201d), which was fully implemented on May 26, 2021. The MDR places stricter requirements on manufacturers and European Notified Bodies regarding, among other things, product classifications and pre- and post-market clinical studies for product clearances and approvals which could result in product reclassifications or the imposition of other regulatory requirements that could delay, impede, or prevent our ability to commercialize existing, improved, or new products in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and other markets that require CE Marking. Additionally, to the extent the MDR places stricter requirements on manufacturers of custom-made devices, those new requirements could delay, impede, or otherwise impact the availability of our E-xtra Design Engineering products. Finally, COVID-19 has impacted the predictability and timelines associated with the MDR transition.\nSince the implementation of the MDR, Notified Bodies must review any proposed changes to determine if they require evaluation under the MDR or if they can still be evaluated under currently held MDD certifications. Our inability to obtain certifications for changes under the transitional provisions of the MDR\u2019s Article 120 or successfully submit proposed changes requiring MDR evaluation will delay implementation of those changes which could adversely impact our ability to obtain or renew certifications, clearances, or approvals for our products.\nFinally, we anticipate additional regulatory impact as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d) has announced that CE Marking will continue to be recognized in the UK and certificates issued by EU-recognized Notified Bodies will continue to be valid in the UK market until June 30, 2023. Going forward, all devices marketed in the UK will require UK Conformity Assessed Marks certified by a UK Approved Body (the re-designation of the UK Notified Body).\nIn 2019, our notified body in the UK, Lloyd\u2019s Register Quality Assurance Limited (\u201cLRQA\u201d), informed us that it would no longer provide Notified Body services for medical devices effective September 2019. The governing German competent authority, the Regierungspraesidium-Tubingen, granted us an extended grace period until December 31, 2021 to transfer LRQA-issued certifications for BioGlue and PhotoFix to a new Notified Body. We are currently in the process of transferring BioGlue and PhotoFix to our new Notified Body, DEKRA. While positive progress has been made, DEKRA has been unable to complete the last audit, a Phase 2 onsite audit, for our registration due to COVID-19 restrictions on travel, staffing shortages, and workload related to the transition to the MDR. We currently have sufficient inventory on the market in the EU to cover customer demand for a period of the transition. We also are currently requesting derogations from certain individual European countries to allow us to continue to commercialize BioGlue in those countries until we can complete the certification process with DEKRA. Failure to obtain such derogations before our inventory is depleted, or any other delays in this transition, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply demand in affected jurisdictions, have a material, adverse impact on our business, and may also impact our Medical Device Single Audit Program (\u201cMDSAP\u201d) certifications. Failure to timely obtain new MDSAP certifications following their expiration may impact our ability to distribute covered products in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Japan.\nReclassification by the FDA of CryoValve SG pulmonary heart valve (\u201cCryoValve SGPV\u201d) may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV.\nIn December 2019 we learned that the FDA is preparing to issue a proposed rule for reclassification of more than minimally manipulated (\u201cMMM\u201d) allograft heart valves to Class III medical devices, which could include our CryoValve SGPV. Following a comment period and subsequent publication of any final rule, should the CryoValve SGPV be determined to be MMM, we expect to have approximately thirty months to submit an FDA PMA application, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers during review of the PMA application. To date, the FDA has not issued such a proposed final rule.\nIf the FDA ultimately classifies our CryoValve SGPV as a Class III medical device, and if there are delays in obtaining the PMA, if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the PMA, or if the costs associated with these activities are significant, we could decide that the requirements for continued processing of the CryoValve SGPV are too onerous, leading us to discontinue distribution of these tissues.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining clinical results or regulatory clearances/approvals for new and existing products and services, and our approved products and services may not achieve market acceptance.\nOur growth and profitability depends in part upon our ability to develop, and successfully introduce, new products and services, or expand upon existing indications, clearances, and approvals, requiring that we invest significant time and resources to obtain new regulatory clearances/approvals, including investment into pre- and post-market clinical studies. Although we believe certain products and services in our portfolio or under development may be effective in a particular application, we cannot be certain until we successfully execute on relevant clinical trials, and the results we obtain from pre- and post-market clinical studies may be insufficient for us to obtain or maintain any required regulatory approvals or clearances.\nWe are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China, where the Chinese regulatory body has made additional requests, and expressed several concerns, related to the application. If we cannot satisfy the regulator\u2019s requests and concerns and obtain approval or an extension in April 2022, the pending application will expire and no longer be eligible for allowance, requiring the Company to restart or decide to abandon the approval process.\nEach of our trials, studies, and approvals is subject to the risks outlined herein.\nWe cannot give assurance that regulatory agencies will clear or approve these products and services or indications, or any new products and services or new indications, on a timely basis, if ever, or that the products and services or new indications will adequately meet the requirements of the market or achieve market acceptance. Pre- and post-market clinical studies may also be delayed or halted due to many factors beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product, service, or application, or if we determine for any reason not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of any product, service, or application, particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital, this could materially, adversely affect our financial performance. Research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services. Even the successful commercialization of a new product or service in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing, under-utilized production capacity, and continuing research and development and education costs, among other things. The introduction of new products or services may require significant physician training or years of clinical evidence in order to gain acceptance in the medical community.\nRegulatory enforcement activities regarding Ethylene Oxide, which is used to sterilize some of our products and components, could have a material, adverse impact on us.\nSome of our products, including our On-X products, are sterilized using Ethylene Oxide (\u201cEtO\u201d). Although we have a small-scale EtO facility in Austin, Texas, we rely primarily on large-scale EtO facilities to sterilize our products. In addition, some of our suppliers use, or rely upon third parties to use, EtO to sterilize some of our product components. Concerns about the release of EtO into the environment at unsafe levels have led to increased activism and lobbying as well as various regulatory enforcement activities against EtO facilities, including closures and temporary closures, as well as proposals increasing regulations related to EtO. The number of EtO facilities in the US is limited, and any permanent or temporary closures or disruption to their operations could delay, impede, or prevent our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, any regulatory enforcement activities against us for our use of EtO could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the continued use of our products for approved uses. Generally, regulators contend that, unless our products are approved or cleared by a regulatory body for alternative uses, we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products or promote them for such uses. Such limitations present a risk that law enforcement could allege that the nature and scope of our sales, marketing, or support activities, though designed to comply with all regulatory requirements, constitute unlawful promotion of our products for an unapproved use. We also face the risk that such authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that we discontinued or changed. Investigations concerning the promotion of unapproved uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive, and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of the law, we may face significant fines and penalties and may be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant, and educational activities. In addition, we or our officers could be excluded from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material, adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the governmental authorities, third-party payors, and elected office holders and candidates to impact public health, control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the healthcare systems. Additional uncertainty is anticipated as debates about healthcare, vaccines, and public health continue in light of the COVID-19 pandemic which may have an impact on US law relating to the healthcare industry. Many US healthcare laws, such as the Affordable Care Act, are complex, subject to change, and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion. The application of these laws to us, our customers, or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers is not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately any changes to, or the repeal or invalidation of all or part of the Affordable Care Act and similar or future laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As an example, the Executive Branch of the US government recently issued three vaccine mandates that may cover all, or groups of, our US workforce. While the temporary mandate has been withdrawn by the executive branch because the US Supreme Court stayed it, the Executive Branch of the US government has indicated that it intends to issue a similar permanent mandate and it may issue other such mandates. We are currently evaluating the applicability of the remaining two mandates to us. In addition, states and local authorities have begun to issue various forms of vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 related restrictive measures, while others have issued bans of such measures. If we determine that any of these COVID-19 related restrictions apply to us or that they are in conflict with one another, attempted compliance with such laws could cause disruption to our business and in our workforce that could have an impact on our ability to attract or retain talent and increase our costs or could otherwise adversely affect our business and profitability.\nFurther, the growth of our business, results of operations and financial condition rely, in part, on customers in the healthcare industry that receive substantial revenues from governmental and other third-party payer programs. A reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or a change in reimbursement or allocation methodologies, or a change in reimbursement related to products designated as \u201cbreakthrough devices\u201d by the FDA, could negatively affect our customers\u2019 businesses and, in turn, negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes, could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nLegal, Quality, and Regulatory Risks\nAs a medical device manufacturer and tissue services provider we are exposed to risk of product liability claims and our existing insurance coverage may be insufficient, or we may be unable to obtain insurance in the future, to cover any resulting liability.\nOur products and processed tissues allegedly have caused, and may in the future cause, injury or result in other serious complications that may result in product or other liability claims from our customers or their patients. If our products are defectively designed, manufactured, or labeled, or contain inadequate warnings, defective components, or are misused, or are used contrary to our warnings, instructions, and approved indications, we may become subject to costly litigation that can have unpredictable and sometimes extreme outcomes.\nWe maintain claims-made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product and tissue processing liability and securities, claims, among others, that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect. These policies do not include coverage for punitive damages. Although we have insurance for product and tissue processing liabilities, securities, property, and general liabilities, if we are unsuccessful in arranging cost-effective acceptable resolutions of claims, it is possible that our insurance program may not be adequate to cover any or all possible claims or losses, including losses arising out of natural disasters or catastrophic circumstances. Any significant claim could result in an increase in our insurance rates or jeopardize our ability to secure coverage on reasonable terms, if at all.\nAny securities or product liability/tissue processing claim, even a meritless or unsuccessful one, could be costly to defend, and result in diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business, adverse publicity, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, injury to our reputation, or loss of revenue.\nWe are subject to various US and international bribery, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy, transparency, and similar laws, any breach of which could cause a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability.\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers are subject to scrutiny under various US and international bribery, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy, transparency, and similar laws, often referred to collectively as \u201chealthcare compliance laws.\u201d Healthcare compliance laws are broad, sometimes ambiguous, complex, and subject to change and changing interpretations. Possible sanctions for violation of these healthcare compliance laws include fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and despite our compliance efforts, we face the risk of an enforcement activity or a finding of a violation of these laws.\nWe have entered into consulting and product development agreements with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. We have also adopted the AdvaMed Code of Conduct, the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice, and the APACMed Code of Ethical Conduct which govern our relationships with healthcare professionals to bolster our compliance with healthcare compliance laws. While our relationships with healthcare professionals and organizations are structured to comply with such laws and we conduct training sessions on these laws and Codes, it is possible that enforcement authorities may view our relationships as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties or debarment. In any event, any enforcement review of or action against us as a result of such review, regardless of outcome, could be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in or interpretations of these laws, whether these changes will be retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nThe proliferation of new and expanded data privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, could adversely affect our business.\nAn increasing number of federal, state, and foreign data privacy laws and regulations, which can be enforced by private parties or governmental entities, have been or are being promulgated and are constantly evolving. These laws and regulations may include new requirements for companies that receive or process an individual\u2019s personal data (including employees), which increases our operating costs and requires significant management time and energy. Many of these laws and regulations, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) also include significant penalties for noncompliance. Although our personal data practices, policies, and procedures are intended to comply with GDPR and other data privacy laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view our arrangements as being in compliance with applicable laws, or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Any privacy related government enforcement activities may be costly, result in negative publicity, or subject us to significant penalties.\nSome of our products and technologies are subject to significant intellectual property risks and uncertainty.\nWe own trade secrets, patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to our technologies and trademarks and goodwill related to our products and services, which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our trade secrets, that our pending patent applications will issue as patents, or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any intellectual property that we adopt, own, or license. Competitors may independently develop our proprietary technologies or design non-infringing alternatives to patented inventions. We do not control the maintenance, prosecution, enforcement, or strategy for in-licensed intellectual property and as such are dependent in part on the owners of these rights to maintain their viability. Their failure to do so could significantly impair our ability to exploit those technologies. Additionally, our technologies, products, or services could infringe intellectual property rights owned by others, or others could infringe our intellectual property rights.\nIf we become involved in intellectual property disputes, the costs could be expensive, and if we were to lose or decide to settle, the amounts or effects of the settlement or award by a tribunal could be costly.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries, including (subject in each case to certain exceptions) restrictions or prohibitions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\uf0b7Incur or guarantee additional debt or create liens on certain assets;\n\uf0b7Pay dividends on or make distributions of our share capital, including repurchasing or redeeming capital stock, or make other restricted payments, including restricted junior payments;\n\uf0b7Enter into agreements that restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us, repay debt owed to us or our subsidiaries, or make loans or advances to us or our other subsidiaries;\n\uf0b7Enter into certain transactions with our affiliates including any transaction or merger or consolidation, liquidation, winding-up, or dissolution; convey, sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of our business, assets or property; or sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of any capital stock of any subsidiary;\n\uf0b7Enter into certain rate swap transactions, basis swaps, credit derivative transactions, and other similar transactions, whether relating to interest rates, commodities, investments, securities, currencies, or any other relevant measure, or transactions of any kind subject to any form of master purchase agreement governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., any International Foreign Exchange Master Agreement, or any other master agreement;\n\uf0b7Amend, supplement, waive, or otherwise modify our or our subsidiaries organizational documents in a manner that would be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders, or change or amend the terms of documentation regarding junior financing in a manner that would be materially adverse to the interests of the lenders;\n\uf0b7Make changes to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 fiscal year without notice to the administrative agent under the agreement;\n\uf0b7Enter into agreements which restrict our ability to incur liens;\n\uf0b7Engage in any line of business substantially different from that in which we are currently engaged; and\n\uf0b7Make certain investments, including strategic acquisitions or joint ventures.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our operational flexibility, and hinder our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry. It may also limit our ability to borrow money, require us to dedicate substantial portions of our cash flow to repayment, and restrict our ability to invest in business opportunities. Because most of our borrowings are at a variable rate of interest, we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our US assets as collateral under our existing Credit Agreement. If we default on the terms of such credit agreements and the holders of our indebtedness accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in our existing Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. In the event of any such default, the holders of our indebtedness:\n\uf0b7Will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; and\n\uf0b7Could elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable.\nIf we are unable to repay those amounts, the holders of our secured indebtedness could proceed against their secured collateral to seek repayment out of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of our assets. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists from time to time propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a company. Such involvement may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such involvement could result in the loss of business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern for our current or potential customers, cause significant fluctuations in stock price, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nOur business could be impacted by increased shareholder emphasis on environmental, social, and governance matters.\nInvestors and other key stakeholders are increasingly focusing on areas of corporate responsibility, and particularly matters related to environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors. Institutional investors have expressed expectations with respect to ESG matters that they use to guide their investment strategies and may, in some cases, choose not to invest in us if they believe our ESG policies are lagging or inadequate. Other stakeholders also have expectations regarding ESG factors, such as employees or potential employees who desire to work for a company that reflects their personal values. These areas of focus are continuing to evolve, as are the criteria that investors assess companies\u2019 performance in these areas. Investors are increasingly looking to companies that demonstrate strong ESG and sustainability practices as an indicator of long-term resilience, especially in light of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping up with and meeting these expectations may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management, and we may be unable to make the investments in ESG that our competitors with greater financial resources are able to make. Failure to meet the expectations of investors and other stakeholders in these areas may damage our reputation, impact employee retention, impact the willingness of our customers to do business with us, or otherwise impact our financial results and stock price.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2015 our Board of Directors discontinued dividend payments on our common stock for the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, our shareholders may receive a return on their investment in our common stock only through appreciation of shares of our common stock that they own. In addition, restrictions in our credit facility limit our ability to pay future dividends.\nProvisions of Delaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to shareholders, which could affect our share price adversely and prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management.\nEffective January 1, 2022, we reincorporated in Delaware. Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, the organizational documents adopted in connection with our reincorporation contain provisions that restrict persons who may call shareholder meetings, allow the issuance of blank-check preferred stock without the vote of shareholders, and allow the Board of Directors to fill vacancies and fix the number of directors. These provisions of Delaware law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prevent attempts by shareholders to remove current management, prohibit or delay mergers or other changes of control transactions, and discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. The effects of reincorporation in Delaware are detailed in our 2021 Special Proxy Statement and Notice of Special Meeting filed with the SEC on October 7, 2021.", "PERMNO": 78876, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CRY"}
