{"cik": "1057083", "company": "PC TEL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Future Operations\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business model depends upon our ability to recognize significant emerging technologies in a timely manner and to innovate to solve the engineering problems presented by such emerging technologies.\nOur strength is solving complex network engineering problems through our products and solutions. In order to provide solutions to complex engineering problems, we must anticipate which technologies are promising and will be adopted by our customers and potential customers, and we need to be engaged early in the development of these new technologies and products. If we expend resources on the wrong technologies or are not included in the development phase of new technologies that are widely adopted in our industry, we may miss the opportunity for meaningful participation or revenue generation. Missed opportunities like these could have a negative impact on our long-term competitiveness.\nTo innovate and solve complex network engineering problems, we have to offer highly competitive compensation in order to attract and retain specific types of engineers and other skilled professionals. In addition, we must create intellectual property or obtain it from third parties when necessary. Failure to accomplish these tasks while managing the costs thereof will result in difficulty in distinguishing us from our competitors and may result in a significant loss of business or diminishing margin on our products.\nWe have significant international operations and face risks related to global public health crises such as the coronavirus epidemic.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the recent worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the conduct of business. These measures have resulted in work stoppages and other disruptions at our manufacturing facilities in China as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our contract manufacturers. If our supply chain experiences extended disruptions, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and our end customers\u2019 products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nCompetition within the wireless product industry is intense and could result in decreased margins on our products or loss of key customers. Failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results.\nCompetition in our industry can result from the following:\n\u2022\ncompetitors, including foreign government-funded competitors, significantly reducing prices on their products causing disruption to our customer relationships;\n\u2022\ncustomers demanding lower prices and requiring suppliers like us to engage in auctions and other forms of competitive bidding for purchase orders;\n\u2022\nentrance of a significant competitor in the markets for our products, either from new participants, such as emerging low-cost Chinese competitors, or as a result of a merger of existing competitors; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products and delivery of their services. These competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets, obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products, or otherwise gain a competitive advantage.\nConducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.\nA substantial portion of our manufacturing, and a portion of our research and development and sales activities is conducted outside the United States, primarily in China. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including: (i) fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and in particular the impact of a re-valuation of the Chinese Yuan; (ii) impact of tariffs or trade wars among the countries in which we do business; (iii) difficulties in repatriation of earnings; (iv) disruption to our supply chain, whether as a result of the spread of COVID-19 or other factors which limit our ability to import materials and export products; (v) nationalist sentiment creating advantages for our competitors in their home countries; (vi) impact of labor unrest, potentially in connection with the reduction in force of a significant portion of our workforce in Tianjin, China (vii) unexpected legal or regulatory changes, particularly changes to environmental, labor or manufacturing regulations; (viii) lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property rights and the risk of theft and forced transfer of intellectual property; (ix) difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel and managing international operations;(x) under-developed infrastructure; and (xi) other unfavorable political or economic factors which could include nationalization of the wireless communications or related industries. If we are unable to manage successfully these and other risks pertaining to our international activities, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative imposed tariffs on certain imports from mainland China containing industrially significant technologies and in September 2019 additional tariffs were imposed. In January 2020, the U.S. and China entered into a phase 1 trade deal which reduced the tariffs imposed in September 2019 from 15.0% to 7.5%. Currently all of our imports from China are subject to U.S. tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25.0%. The tariffs apply to the antenna products sent from our facility in Tianjin, China and our China-based contract manufacturers to our U.S.-based customers and components and materials sent from our Tianjin facility and our China-based contract manufacturers to our Bloomingdale, Illinois facility for final assembly. Tariffs impact the gross margin that we earn on sales of our products. We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit, but we may not be able to adjust our prices enough to cover the entire cost of the imposed tariffs. The impact of the tariffs on our future revenue and profitability is uncertain. We do not believe these price increases resulted in a significant loss of revenue in 2019. In addition, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures may have a negative effect on customer confidence and spending.\nDisruption in our manufacturing and supply chains could adversely impact our sales and reputation.\nWe have limited in-house manufacturing capability. For some product lines we outsource the manufacturing, assembly, and testing of printed circuit board subsystems. For other product lines, we purchase completed hardware platforms and add our proprietary software. While our suppliers have no unique capability, any failure by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments could cause delayed product delivery and potentially disrupt our supply chain and ability to accept new orders for products.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has impacted supply chains worldwide and may impact our ability to produce and sell products. See the risk factor presented under \u201cWe have significant international operations and face risks related to global public health crises such as the coronavirus epidemic.\u201d\nIn addition, in the event that for any reason our suppliers discontinue manufacturing materials used in our products, we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary. Either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs and increased prices of our products.\nWe assemble our antenna products in our facilities located in Bloomingdale, Illinois and Tianjin, China and test & measurement products at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland. We may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems at our assembly facilities, which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers. In addition, a number of our antenna products are currently manufactured in China via contract manufacturers and, as described in the section titled \u201cManufacturing\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K, we are transitioning additional products currently manufactured in our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. Any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers' operations could cause delayed product delivery, which could negatively impact our sales, competitive reputation and position. Moreover, if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our products, either of which could materially affect our operating results and may lead to obsolete inventory.\nIn summary, in order to be successful, we must manage our operations to limit the cost of product production, accurately forecast demand for our products, avoid excess production and inventory that results in waste or obsolescence, dual source critical materials to avoid shortages and delays in shipping, build for manufacturability and avoid excessive quality issues.\nFuture acquisitions and investments may not yield their intended benefits. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our business.\nIn the future, we may make acquisitions of, or large investments in, businesses that offer products, and technologies that we believe would complement our products, including wireless products and technology. We may also make acquisitions of or investments in, businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels. Even if we were to announce an acquisition, we may not be able to complete it. Additionally, any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, operations, internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business,\n\u2022\ndisruption of our on-going business,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies,\n\u2022\ntax, employment, logistics, and other related issues unique to international organizations and assets we acquire,\n\u2022\npossible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel, and\n\u2022\nimpairment of assets related to resulting goodwill, and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect that future acquisitions may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and our common stock. If consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock, this would further dilute our existing stockholders. We may also incur debt to pay for an acquisition which could impose restrictive covenants on how we conduct our business.\nAny delays in our sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products.\nSales cycles for our products with major customers can be lengthy, often lasting nine months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer requires volume production of our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour OEM customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, and\n\u2022\nthe development of new technologies and commercialization of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is largely based on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional uncertainty that customers may decide to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without enough time for us to reduce our operating expenses.\nA failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense.\nInformation technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. While we have engaged experts in cybersecurity to advise us and we have taken protective measures, our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders\u2019 intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAdditional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States, China and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination, litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our stock fluctuates, sometimes significantly, based upon a variety of factors, many of which are not under our control.\nOver time, our stock experiences significant changes in price on a percentage basis. The closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market fluctuated between a high of $9.03 and a low of $4.32 during 2019. A variety of factors, many of which are not under of our control influence our stock price, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, including COVID-19 and recessions\n\u2022\nnew products offered by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results,\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts,\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations,\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments,\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry,\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel,\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions,\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our stockholders or the Company, and\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock by the Company.\nProvisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor. Specifically, our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent, do\nnot permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting, and provide for a classified board of directors, which means stockholders can only elect, or remove, a limited number of our directors in any given year. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, and as a result, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Further, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.", "PERMNO": 87361, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PCTI"}
