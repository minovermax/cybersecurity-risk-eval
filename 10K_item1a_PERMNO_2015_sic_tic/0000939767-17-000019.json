Risk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur future prospects are critically dependent upon the commercial success of CABOMETYX for advanced RCC and the further clinical development and commercial success of cabozantinib in additional indications.\nOur mission is to maximize the clinical and commercial potential of cabozantinib and cobimetinib and position the Exelixis business for future growth through the resumption of our discovery efforts and the expansion of our development pipeline. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenue to fund our commercial operations and our development and discovery programs is dependent upon the successful commercialization of CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC in territories where it has been or may soon be approved. The commercial potential of CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC remains subject to a variety of factors, most importantly, CABOMETYX\u2019s perceived benefit/risk profile as compared to the benefit/risk profiles of other treatments available or currently in development for the treatment of advanced RCC. If revenue from CABOMETYX decreases, we may need to reduce our operating expenses or raise additional funds to execute our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Furthermore, as a consequence of our\nexclusive collaboration agreement with Ipsen, we rely heavily upon Ipsen\u2019s regulatory, commercial, medical affairs, and other expertise and resources for commercialization of CABOMETYX in territories outside of the United States and Japan. If Ipsen is unable to, or does not invest the resources necessary to, successfully commercialize CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC in the European Union and other international territories where it may be approved, this could reduce the amount of revenue we are due to receive under our collaboration agreement with Ipsen, thus resulting in harm to our business and operations.\nWe also believe that there are commercial opportunities for cabozantinib in therapeutic indications beyond advanced RCC, and we are pursuing these opportunities by dedicating substantial proprietary resources to developing cabozantinib into a broad and significant oncology franchise. Even following the approval of CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC in the United States and European Union, our success remains contingent upon, among other things, successful clinical development, regulatory approval and market acceptance of cabozantinib in additional indications, such as first-line RCC, advanced HCC, NSCLC, and other forms of cancer. With top-line results from CELESTIAL anticipated in 2017, we expect growth of the cabozantinib oncology franchise to be most immediately impacted by the clinical trial results of cabozantinib in advanced HCC. However, the historical rate of failures for product candidates in clinical development is high. Should we prove unsuccessful in the further development of cabozantinib beyond MTC or advanced RCC, we may be unable to execute our business plan and our revenues and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are heavily dependent on our partner, Genentech (a member of the Roche group), for the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of cobimetinib.\nThe terms of our collaboration agreement with Genentech provide them with exclusive authority over the global development and commercialization plans for cobimetinib and the execution of those plans. We have no effective influence over those plans and are heavily dependent on Genentech\u2019s decision making. The collaboration agreement provides that we are entitled to a share of U.S. profits and losses received in connection with commercialization of cobimetinib. We are also entitled to low double-digit royalties on ex-U.S. net sales of cobimetinib. In both cases, we are heavily dependent on Genentech\u2019s internal accounting procedures for determining how much, if any, profit we may derive from the collaboration. In connection with the commercialization of Cotellic, we believed Genentech\u2019s pricing of, and cost and revenue allocations for, Cotellic, as determined exclusively by Genentech, have been contrary to the applicable terms of the collaboration agreement. We raised this concern with Genentech, along with other material concerns regarding Genentech\u2019s performance under the collaboration agreement, but were unable to come to resolution on any of these issues. Accordingly, on June 3, 2016, following a 30 day dispute resolution period, we filed a demand for arbitration asserting claims against Genentech related to its clinical development, pricing and commercialization of Cotellic, and cost and revenue allocations in connection with Cotellic\u2019s commercialization in the United States. Soon thereafter, Genentech asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking monetary damages and interest related to the cost allocations under the collaboration agreement. On December 29, 2016, Genentech withdrew its counterclaim against us and stated that it would unilaterally change its approach to allocation of promotional expenses arising from commercialization of the Cotellic plus Zelboraf combination therapy, both retrospectively and prospectively. Notwithstanding Genentech\u2019s change of approach, other significant issues remain in dispute between the parties. Genentech\u2019s action does not address the claims in our demand for arbitration related to Genentech\u2019s clinical development of cobimetinib, or pricing and promotional costs for Cotellic in the United States, nor does it fully resolve claims over revenue allocation. And, Genentech has not clarified how it intends to allocate promotional costs incurred with respect to the promotion of other combination therapies that include cobimetinib for other indications that will be developed or are in development and may be approved. As a result, we will continue to press our position for the arbitral panel to obtain a just resolution of these claims. The ultimate outcome and timing of the arbitration is difficult to predict.\nWe are also completely dependent upon Genentech to develop cobimetinib further. Any significant changes to Genentech\u2019s business strategy and priorities, over which we have no control, could adversely affect Genentech\u2019s willingness or ability to complete their obligations under our collaboration agreement and result in harm to our business and operations. Subject to contractual diligence obligations, Genentech has complete control over and financial responsibility for cobimetinib\u2019s development program and regulatory strategy and execution, and we are not able to control the amount or timing of resources that Genentech will devote to the product. Of particular significance are Genentech\u2019s development efforts with respect to the combination of cobimetinib with immuno-oncology agents, a promising and competitive area of clinical research. Regardless of Genentech\u2019s efforts and expenditures for the further development of cobimetinib, the results of such additional clinical investigation may not prove positive and may not produce label expansions or approval in additional indications.\nThe commercial success of cabozantinib, as CABOMETYX tablets for advanced RCC and as COMETRIQ capsules for MTC, or if approved for additional indications, will depend upon the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payers, and the medical community.\nOur ability to commercialize cabozantinib, as CABOMETYX tablets for advanced RCC and COMETRIQ capsules for MTC, or if approved for additional indications, will be highly dependent upon the extent to which cabozantinib gains market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and commercial plans and the medical community. If cabozantinib does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant future product revenues. The degree of market acceptance of CABOMETYX, COMETRIQ and other cabozantinib products, if approved, will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness, of cabozantinib in comparison to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe safety of cabozantinib, including the existence of serious side effects of cabozantinib and their severity in comparison to those of any competing products;\n\u2022\ncabozantinib\u2019s relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nunexpected results connected with analysis of data from future or ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing of cabozantinib label expansions for additional indications, if any, relative to competitive treatments;\n\u2022\nthe price of cabozantinib relative to competitive therapies and any new government initiatives affecting pharmaceutical pricing;\n\u2022\nthe strength of CABOMETYX sales efforts, marketing, medical affairs and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe sufficiency of commercial and government insurance coverage and reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights with respect to cabozantinib.\nIf we are unable to maintain or scale adequate sales, marketing, market access and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to commercialize cabozantinib successfully.\nIn connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of CABOMETYX for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC, we substantially increased our sales, marketing, market access, medical affairs and product distribution capabilities. Establishing and maintaining these capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of cabozantinib, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Also, to the extent that the commercial opportunities for cabozantinib grows over time, we may not properly judge the requisite size and experience of the commercialization teams or the scale of distribution necessary to market and sell cabozantinib successfully. If we are unable to scale our organization appropriately, we may not be able to maximize product revenues and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on a single third party logistics provider (with two distribution locations) to handle shipping and warehousing for our commercial supply of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. While we have expanded our U.S. distribution and pharmacy channels in connection with the approval of CABOMETYX by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC in the United States, we still rely on a relatively limited distribution network to dispense COMETRIQ in fulfillment of prescriptions in the United States. Furthermore, we rely on our collaboration partners for the commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in territories outside of the United States, as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under the NPU program.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon the activities, and legal and regulatory compliance, of these or other third parties, may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to supply cabozantinib to the marketplace on a timely and competitive basis. For example, if a warehouse of our third party logistics provider suffers a fire or damage from another type of disaster, a significant portion of the commercial supply of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ could be destroyed, resulting in a disruption in our commercialization efforts. These or other third parties may not be able to provide services in the time we require to meet our commercial timelines and objectives or to meet regulatory requirements. We may not be able to maintain or renew our arrangements with third parties, or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms, or at all. Third parties could terminate or decline to renew our arrangements based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. If we are unable to contract for logistics services or distribution of cabozantinib on acceptable terms, our commercialization efforts may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws and regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, which governs our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities. The AKS prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the AKS and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The AKS has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others;\n\u2022\nthe FDCA and its regulations which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals);\n\u2022\nfederal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022\nfederal and state government price reporting laws that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our marketed drugs (participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs, and could potentially affect our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts); and\n\u2022\nfederal and state financial transparency laws, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the United States to be tracked and reported (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships with healthcare providers and healthcare entities, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business and/or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities).\nIn addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate certain federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, FDA rules and regulations, as well as false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act. Suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend a civil False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nNumerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and between countries in the European Union and countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.\nIf we are unable to obtain both adequate coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ is highly dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Patients may not be capable of paying for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ themselves and may rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, the costs of their medications, among other medical costs. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased. There has been negative publicity regarding, and increasing legislative ad enforcement interest in the United States with respect to, drug pricing and the use of specialty pharmacies, which may result in physicians being less willing to participate in our patient access programs and thereby limit our ability to increase patient access and adoption of cabozantinib. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, price negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after marketing authorization is granted for a product, which has the potential to substantially delay broad availability of the product in some of those countries. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, we and our collaboration partner, Ipsen, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of CABOMETYX to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in the commercialization of CABOMETYX. Third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payers limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. In particular, third-party payers may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we and our collaboration partner, Ipsen, might establish for CABOMETYX, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ profitably.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.\nIn January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of PPACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of PPACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of PPACA that are repealed. Moreover, certain politicians, including the President, have announced plans to regulate the prices of pharmaceutical products. We cannot know what form any such legislation may take or the market\u2019s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may limit our ability to generate revenue or commercialize our current products and/or those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nAs a result of the overall trend towards cost-effectiveness criteria and managed healthcare in the United States, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may use tiered reimbursement and may adversely affect demand for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ by placing a particular product in an expensive tier. They may also refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payers will reimburse for newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. We also anticipate pricing pressures in connection with the sale of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ due to the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and prospects for profitability.\nPricing for pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny by governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that have the effect of reducing our revenue or harming our business or reputation.\nMany companies in our industry have received a governmental request for documents and information relating to drug pricing and patient support programs. We may become subject to similar requests, which would require us to incur significant expense and result in distraction for our management team. Additionally, to the extent there are findings, or even allegations, of improper conduct on the part of the company, such findings could further harm our business, reputation and/or prospects. It is possible that such inquiries could result in negative publicity or other negative actions that could harm our reputation; changes in our product pricing and distribution strategies; reduced demand for our approved products and/or reduced reimbursement of approved products, including by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and state health care programs.\nIn addition, the Trump Administration has indicated an interest in taking measures pertaining to drug pricing, including potential proposals relating to Medicare price negotiations, and importation of drugs from other countries. At this time, it is unclear whether any of these proposals will be pursued and how they would impact our products or our future product candidates.\nOur competitors may develop products and technologies that impair the value of cabozantinib, cobimetinib and any future product candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly diversified and are characterized by rapid technological change. In particular, the area of novel oncology therapies is a rapidly evolving and competitive field. Specifically, the indication of advanced RCC is highly competitive and several novel therapies and combinations of therapies are in advanced stages of clinical development in this indication, and may compete with or displace cabozantinib. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, as well as\nacademic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Some of our competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets, including some of our existing collaborators. Some of our competitors are further along in the development of their products than we are. Delays in the development of cabozantinib or cobimetinib for the treatment of additional tumor types, for example, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us. Our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances and the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy. Our products may become less marketable if we are unable to successfully adapt our development strategy to address the likelihood that this new approach to treating cancer with immuno-oncology agents will become prevalent in indications for which our products are approved, most notably advanced RCC, and in additional indications where we may seek regulatory approval. Furthermore, the complexities of such a strategy may require collaboration with some of our competitors.\nThe markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib and for which Roche and Genentech intend to pursue regulatory approval for cobimetinib are highly competitive. Further, our competitors may be more effective at using their technologies to develop commercial products. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies and products, and those of our collaborators, obsolete and noncompetitive. There may also be drug candidates of which we are not aware at an earlier stage of development that may compete with cabozantinib, cobimetinib, and our other product candidates.\nIf competitors use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of cabozantinib, our business will suffer.\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the applicant undertaking the human clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. The FDA can also approve a 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the agency\u2019s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug. The filing of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to cabozantinib could have an adverse impact on our stock price. Moreover, if any such ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs were to be approved and the patents covering cabozantinib were not upheld in litigation, or if a generic competitor is found not to infringe these patents, the resulting generic competition would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as the branded drugs, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market. Companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, regardless of the regulatory approval pathway, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product.\nClinical testing of product candidates is a lengthy, costly, complex and uncertain process and may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that a product candidate, even if it is approved for other indications, is ineffective or has an unacceptable safety profile that may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval in a new indication. For example, COMET-1 and COMET-2, our two phase 3 pivotal trials of cabozantinib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, failed to meet their respective primary endpoints of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in OS for patients treated with cabozantinib as compared to prednisone and to demonstrate improvement in pain response for patients treated by cabozantinib as compared to mitoxantrone/prednisone. Based on the outcome of the COMET trials, we deprioritized the clinical development of cabozantinib in mCRPC.\nThe results of preliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and later-stage clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in earlier-stage trials or preliminary studies. Although we have established timelines for manufacturing and clinical development of our product candidates based on existing knowledge of our compounds in development and industry metrics, we may not be able to meet those timelines.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events, during or as a result of clinical testing, that could delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy or harmful side effects;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive clinical trial results may require us to conduct further testing or to abandon projects that we had expected to be promising;\n\u2022\nour competitors may discover or commercialize other compounds or therapies that show significantly improved safety or efficacy compared to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\npatient registration or enrollment in our clinical testing may be lower than we anticipate, resulting in the delay or cancellation of clinical testing;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party contract research organization or investigators to satisfy their contractual obligations, including deviating from trial protocol; and\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may withhold authorization to commence or conduct clinical trials of a product candidate, or delay, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their determination that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nIf we were to have significant delays in or termination of our clinical testing of our product candidates as a result of any of the events described above or otherwise, our expenses could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired, either of which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may not be able to rapidly or effectively continue the further development of our product candidates or meet current or future requirements of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including those identified based on our discussions with the FDA or such other regulatory authorities. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on schedule, or at all, may not be sufficient for registration of our product candidates or may not result in an approvable product.\nCompletion of clinical trials may take several years or more, but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of factors relating to the clinical trial, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe number of patients who ultimately participate in the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe duration of patient follow-up that is appropriate in view of the results or required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical sites included in the trials; and\n\u2022\nthe length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects.\nAny delay could limit our ability to generate revenues, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Our partners under our collaboration agreements may experience similar risks with respect to the compounds we have out-licensed to them. If any of the events described above were to occur with such programs or compounds, the likelihood of receipt of milestones and royalties under such collaboration agreements could decrease.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy and uncertain, and may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe activities associated with the research, development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. We have only limited experience in preparing and filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive, and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. For example, before an NDA or sNDA can be submitted to the FDA, or MAA to the EMA or any application or submission to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and require substantial expenditures.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. For example, the FDA could determine that the design of a clinical trial is inadequate to produce reliable results. The regulatory process also requires preclinical testing, and data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of cabozantinib for any individual, additional indications.\nIn addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review, which may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for our product candidates.\nEven if the FDA or a comparable authority in another jurisdiction approves cabozantinib for an indication beyond advanced RCC and MTC, or one of our other product candidates, the approval may be limited, imposing significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of the product and could impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. For example, in connection with the FDA\u2019s approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we are subject to post-marketing requirement to conduct a clinical study comparing a lower dose of cabozantinib to the approved dose of 140 mg daily cabozantinib in progressive, metastatic MTC. Failure to complete any post-marketing requirements in accordance with the timelines and conditions set forth by the FDA could significantly increase costs or delay, limit or eliminate the commercialization of cabozantinib. Further, these agencies may also impose various administrative, civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.\nWe may be unable to expand our development pipeline, which could limit our growth and revenue potential.\nWe are committed to the discovery, development and promotion of new medicines with the potential to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer. In this regard, we recently resumed internal drug discovery efforts with the goal of identifying new product candidates to advance into clinical trials. Internal discovery efforts to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These internal discovery efforts may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates, or potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have inadequate efficacy, harmful side effects, suboptimal pharmaceutical profile or other characteristics suggesting that they are unlikely to be effective products. Apart from our internal discovery efforts, our strategy to expand our development pipeline is also dependent on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license relevant product candidates. However, the in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and many other companies are pursuing the same or similar product candidates to those that we may consider attractive. Established companies, in particular, may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and more extensive clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to in-license or acquire a relevant product candidate on acceptable terms that would allow us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to develop suitable product candidates through internal discovery effort or if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer. Even if we succeed in our efforts to obtain rights to suitable product candidates, the competitive business environment may result in higher acquisition or licensing costs.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate the target company successfully into our existing business, maintain the key business relationships of the target, or retain key personnel of an acquired business. Furthermore, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or incur unanticipated expenses. Any acquisitions or investments made by us also could result in our spending significant amounts, issuing dilutive securities, assuming or incurring significant debt obligations and contingent liabilities, incurring large one-time expenses and acquiring intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense and significant write-offs, any of which could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements and Financial Results\nIf additional capital is not available to us, we may be forced to limit the expansion of our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $479.6 million in cash and investments, which included $393.8 million available for operations, $81.6 million of compensating balance investments that we are required to maintain on deposit with Silicon Valley Bank, and $4.2 million of long-term restricted investments. Our business operations grew substantially during 2016. In order to continue to grow the business and maximize the clinical and commercial opportunities for cabozantinib and cobimetinib, we plan to continue to execute on the U.S. launch of CABOMETYX, while reinvesting in our product pipeline through the continued development of cabozantinib, continued research and development efforts, as well as through in-licensing and acquisition efforts. Our ability to execute on these business objectives will depend on many factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with maintaining our expanded sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution capabilities for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC and COMETRIQ in the approved MTC indications;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones under our collaboration with Ipsen;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of Cotellic and the calculation of our share of related profits and losses for the commercialization of Cotellic in the U.S. and royalties from Cotellic sales outside the U.S. under our collaboration with Genentech;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of our arbitration against Genentech in which we have asserted claims related to Genentech\u2019s clinical development, pricing and commercialization of Cotellic, and cost and revenue allocations arising from Cotellic\u2019s commercialization in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe potential regulatory approval of cabozantinib as a treatment for previously untreated advanced RCC and in other indications, both in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results, notably the results from CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with advanced HCC;\n\u2022\nour future investments in the expansion of our pipeline through drug discovery and corporate development activities;\n\u2022\nour repayment and any potential mandatory prepayment of the Secured Convertible Notes due 2018, or the Deerfield Notes, (see \u201cNote 7. Debt\u201d to our \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these notes), which mature on July 1, 2018, and which we intend to repay on or about July 1, 2017;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs;\n\u2022\nour ability to remain in compliance with, or amend or cause to be waived, financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical drug supply for our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntrends and developments in the pricing of oncologic therapeutics in the United States and abroad, especially in the European Union;\n\u2022\nscientific developments in the market for oncologic therapeutics and the timing of regulatory approvals for competing oncologic therapies; and\n\u2022\nthe filing, maintenance, prosecution, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nWe have a history of net losses and may incur net losses in the future, and may be unable to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception through December 31, 2016, with the exception of the 2011 fiscal year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $70.2 million and as of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.0 billion. These losses have had an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Excluding fiscal 2011, our research and development expenditures and selling, general and administrative expenses have exceeded our revenues for each fiscal year, and we expect to spend significant additional amounts to fund the continued development and commercialization of cabozantinib. In addition, we plan to expand our product pipeline through the resumption of drug discovery and product acquisition and in-licensing. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating expenses and, consequently, we will need to generate substantial revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.\nSince the launch of our first commercial product in January 2013, through December 31, 2016, we have generated an aggregate of $209.7 million in net product revenues, including $135.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other than sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have derived substantially all of our revenues since inception from collaborative arrangements, including upfront and milestone payments and research funding we earn from any products developed from the collaborative research. The amount of our net profits or losses will depend, in part, on: the level of sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the United States; achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones and the amount of royalties, if any, from sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ under our collaboration with Ipsen; our share of the net profits and losses for the commercialization of Cotellic in the U.S. under our collaboration with Genentech; the amount of royalties from Cotellic sales outside the U.S. under our collaboration with Genentech; other license and contract revenues; and, the level of our expenses, including commercialization activities for cabozantinib and any pipeline expansion efforts.\nOur significant level of indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements as a result of the Deerfield Notes and our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. As of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness through\nmaturity was $205.0 million (excluding trade payables). Our outstanding debt under our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank of $81.6 million will become due and payable in May 2018. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. If we incur additional indebtedness, it would increase our interest expense, leverage and operating and financial costs.\nOur current and any potential future indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including clinical trials, research and development, capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\ndilution experienced by our existing stockholders as a result of a conversion of the Deerfield Notes, at our discretion, into shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or that our cash needs will not increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or planned early repayments, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants imposed under the terms of the Deerfield Notes, or any indebtedness which we have incurred or may incur in the future, we would be in default, which would permit the holders of the Deerfield Notes or other indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such notes or other indebtedness and could cause defaults under the Deerfield Notes, or our other indebtedness. Any default under the Deerfield Notes, or any indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our foreign expenses incurred are associated with establishing and conducting clinical trials for cabozantinib. The amount of these expenses will be impacted by fluctuations in the currencies of those countries in which we conduct clinical trials. Our agreements with the foreign sites that conduct such clinical trials generally provide that payments for the services provided will be calculated in the currency of that country, and converted into U.S. dollars using various exchange rates based upon when services are rendered or the timing of invoices. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign-currency denominated expense increases, and when the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign-currency denominated expense decreases. Consequently, changes in exchange rates may affect our financial position and results of operations.\nGlobal credit and financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of our current portfolio of cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments and our ability to meet our financing objectives.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase. While as of the date of this report we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments since December 31, 2016, no assurance can be given that a deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or investments or our ability to meet our financing objectives.\nOur financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Significant estimates that may be made by us include assumptions used in the determination of revenue recognition, discounts and allowances from gross revenue, inventory and stock-based compensation. Although we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, our interpretation of existing accounting literature and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, if our assumptions prove to be materially incorrect, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition, future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse, unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our financial position or results of operations. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency in the past and are expected to occur again in the future and as a result we may be required to make changes in our accounting policies. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues and expenses, prospects for profitability or financial position. For example, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update entitled Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 2014-09, which will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting pronouncements when it becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. We do not expect that ASU 2014-09 will have a material impact on the recognition of revenue from product sales. We are still in the process of evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on revenue recognition from our collaboration and license agreements, such as our arrangements with Ipsen and Genentech. In any event, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard on all of our revenues, including those mentioned above, and our preliminary assessments may change in the future based on our continuing evaluation. The application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and costs, could have a significant impact on our reported results.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe are dependent upon our collaborations with major companies, which subjects us to a number of risks.\nWe have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including, Ipsen, Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo, Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada), BMS and Sanofi for the development and ultimate commercialization of certain compounds generated from our research and development efforts. Our dependence on our relationships with existing collaborators for the development and commercialization of compounds under the collaborations subjects us to, and our dependence on future collaborators for development and commercialization of additional compounds will subject us to, a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe are not able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or potential future collaborators will devote to the development or commercialization of drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nwe are not able to control the U.S. commercial resourcing decisions made and resulting costs incurred by Genentech for cobimetinib, which reasonable costs we are obligated to share, in part, under our collaboration agreement with Genentech;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that diminish or delay receipt of the economic benefits we are entitled to receive under the collaboration, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not be successful in their efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not comply with applicable healthcare regulatory laws;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\na collaborator could independently move forward with a competing drug candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\nwe may be precluded from entering into additional collaboration arrangements with other parties in an area or field of exclusivity;\n\u2022\nfuture collaborators may require us to relinquish some important rights, such as marketing and distribution rights; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay, and may increase the cost of development of our drug candidates.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not receive collaboration revenue or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from such collaborations, our product development efforts could be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf third parties upon which we rely do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib for the treatment of additional indications beyond advanced RCC and MTC.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials for cabozantinib independently, including our post-marketing commitments in connection with the approvals of CABOMETYX in advanced RCC and COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC, so we rely on independent third parties for the performance of these trials, such as the U.S. federal government (including NCI-CTEP, a department of the NIH, with whom we have our CRADA), third-party contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties must be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they generate or provide is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib for additional indications beyond the advanced RCC and MTC.\nWe lack the manufacturing capabilities necessary for us to produce cabozantinib for clinical development or for commercial sale and rely on third parties to do so, which subjects us to various risks.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third party CMOs who, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. To establish and manage this supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Although we maintain significant resources to directly oversee the business activities and relationships with companies in our supply chain effectively, we do not have direct control over their operations. Our third party manufacturers may not be able to produce material on a timely basis or manufacture material with the required quality standards, or in the quantity required to meet our development and commercial needs and applicable regulatory requirements. Additionally, as part of our collaboration with Ipsen, we are responsible for the manufacturing and supply of finished, labeled cabozantinib products to Ipsen through the end of the second quarter of 2018. Failure to meet our supply obligations under the collaboration would impair Ipsen\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib and reduce revenues to which we are entitled under the collaboration.\nIf our third party contract manufacturers and suppliers do not continue to supply us with our products or product candidates in a timely fashion and in compliance with applicable quality and regulatory requirements, or otherwise fail or refuse to comply with their obligations to us under our supply and manufacturing arrangements, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and their failure to supply us could impair or preclude our ability to meet our and/or Ipsen\u2019s commercial needs, or our supply needs for clinical trials.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data and personal information) and confidential information with respect to our customers, clinical trial patients and our business partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an\nindividual hacker to a state-sponsored attack and motive (including corporate espionage). Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks continue to become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications and those of our vendors may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, customers and others. Cyber-attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our network security and data recovery measures and those of our vendors may not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as, where and when we deem appropriate. However, these applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Our issued patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties as invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our intellectual property without a license and negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, commercialization or use of our product candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages, if, for example, others were the first to invent or to file patent applications for closely related inventions.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include our products or product candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants, we cannot assure you that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not to breach any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and the technologies of third parties. Other parties have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that\nwe have developed or intend to develop. If patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may require us to pay substantial royalties, grant a cross-license to some of our patents to another patent holder or redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third-party patents, which may be impossible to obtain or could require substantial time and expense. Third parties may accuse us of employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes on their patents. Regardless of their merit, such claims could require us to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical personnel, in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our patents. In the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and independent contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, independent contractors or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or used or sought to use patent inventions belonging to their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying money claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel and/or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain product candidates, which could severely harm our business.\nRisks Related to Employees and Location\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our operations. This growth places significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources, and our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and must expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our growth without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. We expect that we may need to increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations, and recruiting and retaining qualified individuals is difficult. In addition, the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and capital resources. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unsuccessful in recruiting qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to retain and, where necessary, attract additional personnel could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management, as well as clinical, commercial and scientific staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Also, we may not have sufficient personnel to execute our business plan. Retaining and, where necessary, recruiting qualified clinical, commercial and scientific personnel will be critical to support activities related to advancing the development program for cabozantinib and our other compounds, successfully executing upon our commercialization plan for cabozantinib and our internal proprietary research and development efforts. Competition is intense for experienced clinical, commercial and scientific personnel, and we may be unable to retain or recruit such personnel with the expertise or experience necessary to allow us to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Further, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, may leave our employment at any time.\nOur collaborations with outside scientists may be subject to restriction and change.\nWe work with scientific and clinical advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. These advisors and collaborators are not our employees and may have other commitments that limit their availability to us. Although these advisors and collaborators generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. In such a\ncircumstance, we may lose work performed by them, and our development efforts with respect to the matters on which they were working may be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected. In addition, although our advisors and collaborators sign agreements not to disclose our confidential information, it is possible that valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through them.\nOur headquarters are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could harm our operations.\nOur headquarters are located in South San Francisco, California, and therefore our facilities are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We do not carry earthquake insurance. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures, terrorism and similar events since any insurance we may maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition, the unique nature of our research activities could cause significant delays in our programs and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.\nFacility security breaches may disrupt our operations, subject us to liability and harm our operating results.\nAny break-in or trespass at our facilities that results in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, or that results in damage to our research and development equipment and assets, could subject us to liability and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Product Liability\nWe use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may face liability for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and such liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts.\nIn addition, our collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials used by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nWe may be held liable if any product we or our collaborators develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials, product recall, substantial monetary awards to third parties and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or testing our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and commercial activities for cabozantinib in the amount of $20.0 million per occurrence and $20.0 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, if insurance coverage becomes more expensive, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits for claims based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. In addition, the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in general, have been subject to significant medical malpractice litigation. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could harm our reputation and business and would decrease our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline, causing investor losses.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could subject our operating results to volatility, including:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\ncustomer ordering patterns for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, which may vary significantly from period to period;\n\u2022\nthe overall level of demand for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, including the impact of any competitive products and the duration of therapy for patients receiving CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with maintaining our expanded sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution capabilities for CABOMETYX, COMETRIQ and Cotellic;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval for cabozantinib as a treatment of first-line advanced RCC;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of stated regulatory and commercial milestones, under our collaboration with Ipsen;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of our arbitration against Genentech in which we have asserted claims related to Genentech\u2019s clinical development, pricing and commercialization of Cotellic, and cost and revenue allocations arising from Cotellic\u2019s commercialization in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe progress and scope of other development and commercialization activities for cabozantinib and our other compounds;\n\u2022\nfuture clinical trial results, notably the results from CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with advanced HCC;\n\u2022\nour future investments in the expansion of our pipeline through drug discovery and corporate development activities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nrecognition of upfront licensing or other fees or revenues;\n\u2022\npayments of non-refundable upfront or licensing fees, or payment for cost-sharing expenses, to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new technologies or products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and willingness of collaborators to further develop or, if approved, commercialize our product candidates out-licensed to them;\n\u2022\nthe termination or non-renewal of existing collaborations or third party vendor relationships;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates and any approved products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development and manufacturing of cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nadjustments to expenses accrued in prior periods based on management\u2019s estimates after the actual level of activity relating to such expenses becomes more certain;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of acquired goodwill and other assets;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our or our collaborators\u2019 research and development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nDue to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. As a result, in some future quarters, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be extremely volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and we believe the trading price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following, many of which we cannot control:\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in our or our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process, of cabozantinib or our collaborators\u2019 product candidates or those of our competitors or actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our, our collaborators\u2019 or our competitors\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of achievement of our clinical, regulatory, partnering and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial, the filing for regulatory approval or the establishment of collaborative arrangements for cabozantinib or any of our other programs or compounds;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to cabozantinib or our clinical trials for cabozantinib;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our relationships with our collaborators, including the termination or modification of our agreements;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of an in-licensed product candidate or strategic acquisition;\n\u2022\nconflicts or litigation with our collaborators, including the outcome of our arbitration with Genentech regarding Cotellic;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including intellectual property infringement and product liability lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe satisfaction of outstanding debt obligations or entry into new financing arrangements;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock or sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nthird-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\ndisposition of any of our technologies or compounds; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThese factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. Likewise, as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s pending withdrawal from the European Union and/or significant changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and health care spending and delivery, including the potential repeal and/or replacement of all or portions of PPACA or greater restrictions on free trade stemming from Trump Administration policies, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the date of this report.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock or conversion of the Deerfield Notes, or the perception that such sales or conversions may occur, may depress our stock price.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon vesting of restricted stock unit, or RSU, awards, upon a purchase under our employee stock purchase program, upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants and upon conversion of the Deerfield Notes. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, including upon conversion of the Deerfield Notes, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Deerfield Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt.\nCertain provisions applicable to the Deerfield Notes and the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if an acquisition event constitutes a Major Transaction under the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, holders of the Deerfield Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. In this case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Deerfield Notes and the note purchase agreement governing the Deerfield Notes, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carry-forwards before utilization. We concluded, as of December 31, 2016, that an ownership change, as defined under Section 382, had not occurred. However, if there is an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in the future, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net operating losses, or NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating United States federal taxable income. As described above, we have incurred significant net losses since our inception; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the United States federal taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs. A full valuation allowance has been provided for the entire amount of our NOLs.", "PERMNO": 88159, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EXEL"}
