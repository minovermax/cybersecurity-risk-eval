RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the information contained in this Annual Report. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile and have declined significantly in recent years. An extended continuation of low, or a further decline in, commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nPrices for oil and natural gas can fluctuate widely and have declined significantly since 2014. For example, from 2014 through February 24, 2017, NYMEX WTI oil futures contract prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel on June 20, 2014 to a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures prices ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu on February 19, 2014 to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu on March 3, 2016. The duration and magnitude of the decline in crude oil prices cannot be predicted. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the commodities market has been volatile. This market will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global inventories;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe effect of energy conservation efforts or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of carbon dioxide and methane GHGs;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nIf a buildup in inventories, lower global demand, or other factors cause prices for U.S. crude oil to weaken, our cash flows and results of operations may be negatively affected. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in the present value of our reserves and our ability to develop future reserves. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically.\nIf commodity prices decrease, a significant portion of our acquisition, development, and exploitation projects could become uneconomic. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a continuation of low, or a substantial or extended decline in, commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nOur acquisition, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves. We expect to fund our 2017 capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and possibly through additional capital market transactions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. See \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity.\"\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Agreement decrease as a result of a continuation of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCommodity prices have declined significantly from 2014. Through February 24, 2017, NYMEX WTI crude oil futures prices have declined from a high of $107.26 per Bbl on June 20, 2014 to a low of $26.21 per Bbl on February 11, 2016, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures prices have declined from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu on February 19, 2014 to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu on March 3, 2016. Likewise, NGLs have suffered significant declines over the same period. NGLs are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics. As stated above, price declines, as have occurred since 2014, could result in downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. It is possible that prices could decline further, or our estimates of production or other economic factors could change to such an extent that we may be required to impair, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved oil and natural gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved properties may not be recoverable. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value. See Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties included in \"Part 2. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\" for specific information regarding our impairments. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect our results of operations in the period incurred.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our acquisition, development, and exploitation activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \"-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\" In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations resulting from wastewater disposal, discharge of GHGs and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents, such as fires or blowouts;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, such as blizzards, tornados and ice storms;\n\u2022\nissues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\ndeclines in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ntitle problems or legal disputes regarding leasehold rights; and\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill such locations.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under the applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nWe expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to the nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and other commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt obligations. Many of these factors, such as oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy and initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay planned investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could have realized from them and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes contain a number of significant covenants, including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase, or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes impose on us.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement limits the amount we can borrow up to the lowest of (i) the borrowing base, (ii) the aggregate elected borrowing base commitments and (iii) $2.5 billion. The lenders may, in their sole discretion, redetermine the borrowing base on a semi-annual basis based upon projected revenues from the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. If the requisite number of lenders do not agree to a proposed borrowing base, then the borrowing base will be the highest borrowing base acceptable to such lenders. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid.\nA breach of any covenant in our Revolving Credit Agreement would result in a default under the applicable agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under other debt agreements. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our Revolving Credit Agreement, there could be an event of default under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, which could results in an acceleration of repayment.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our Revolving Credit Agreement, there could be an event of default under the terms of this facility. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants, including meeting the financial ratios and tests under our Revolving Credit Agreement, may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. We cannot assure that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial ratios and tests. In the event of a default under our Revolving Credit Agreement, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If any of these events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our Revolving Credit Agreement or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we sell, we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our production, with an emphasis on oil production, primarily consisting of put spreads, basis swaps and three-way collars. See \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-Sources of Our Revenues\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-Realized Prices on the Sale of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs.\" Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthere are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. In addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas, which could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur commodity derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the contract, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.\nDuring periods of declining commodity prices, our derivative contract receivable positions generally increase, which increases our counterparty credit exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss with respect to our commodity derivative contracts.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust reserve estimates to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, existing commodity prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nApproximately 38% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 38% of our net leasehold acreage was undeveloped or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nOur producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. At December 31, 2016, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages or other drought or extreme weather related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketing of oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there is insufficient capacity available on these systems, or if these systems are unavailable to us, the price offered for our production could be significantly depressed, or we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while we construct our own facility. We also rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transport and sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and natural gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient transportation, storage or processing facilities to us, especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist.\nOur drilling and production programs may not be able to obtain access on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise to truck transportation, pipelines, gas gathering, transmission, storage and processing facilities to market our oil and natural gas production.\nThe marketing of oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the capacity and availability of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities. Access to such facilities is, in many respects, beyond our control. If these facilities were unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely (and expect to rely in the future) on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store, process, transmit and sell our oil and natural gas production. Our plans to develop and sell our oil and natural gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance; excessive pressure; physical damage to the gathering, transportation, refining or processing facilities; or lack of capacity on such facilities. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months and in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration.\nExtreme weather conditions could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in the areas where we operate.\nOur exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the availability of and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and natural gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition. While we do typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2016, 52% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Our approximately 116.2 MMBoe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated $992.1 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The future development of our proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecast as well as access to liquidity sources, such as capital markets, our Revolving Credit Agreement and derivative contracts. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they are related to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing acquisition, development, and exploitation activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Further, the horizontal decline curve we use to project our future production is subject to numerous limitations.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of oil and natural gas sold in interstate commerce. In addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. See \"Business-Oil and Natural Gas Production Prices and Production Costs- Marketing and Customers.\" We cannot assure you that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProperties that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that we decide to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of micro-seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogues we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failure or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of, shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of producing properties or businesses that complement or expand our current business. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022\noperating costs; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain, and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \"as is\" basis. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions.\nWe are subject to complex U.S. federal, state, local and other laws and regulations related to environmental, occupational, health and safety issues that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated drilling activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. In addition, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including any\nevolving interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See \"Business-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have precipitated an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated B3 with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody's\") and B+ with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services. On February 8, 2017, our long term debt was upgraded by Moody's from B3 to B2. Since this date, no changes in our credit ratings have occurred; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital or our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable regulatory agency administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any\nviolation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting requirements. We also must comply with the anti-market manipulation rules enforced by FERC. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Additionally, the FTC has regulations intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry with authority to fine violators of the regulations civil penalties of up to $1 million per day and the CFTC prohibits market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC, including similar anti-manipulation authority with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts as that granted to the CFTC with respect to crude oil purchases and sales. The CFTC rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, as described in \"Business-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry.\"\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. EPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells.\nFurthermore, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rules include first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Compliance with these rules will require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment, such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require additional personnel time to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional cap and trade programs have emerged that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Demand for our products may also be adversely affected by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate change, including plans developed in connection with the recent Paris climate conference agreement reached in December 2015, which entered into force in November 2016. The United States is one of over 70 nations that has ratified or otherwise indicated its intent to comply with the agreement. However, the agreement is not binding on the United States. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common industry practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an\nalleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no further action has been taken. Further, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 prohibiting wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \"under some circumstances,\" noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down these rules, but the decision has been appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. A final decision has not yet been issued.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nFurther regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal, state and local level could subject our operations to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays as well as potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Please read \"Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties and market oil or natural gas.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our assets.\nOur operations and drilling activity are concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area in which industry activity has remained relatively steady despite the downturn in commodity prices since 2014. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in this area and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has continued to be competitive and would be expected to increase substantially in the future if commodity prices rebound. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development activities could result in oil and natural gas production volumes being below our forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nDeclining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the United States financial market have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had, and could in the future have, a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion and have a limited operating history.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years. Our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties:\n\u2022\nincreased responsibilities for our executive level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nincreased capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased organizational challenges common to large, expansive operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties. The historical financial information incorporated herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be realized in the future. In addition, our operating history is limited and the results from our current producing wells are not necessarily indicative of success from our future drilling operations.\nPart of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. As of December 31, 2016, we had drilled and completed 142 gross (132.9 net) horizontal wells and therefore are subject to increased risks associated with horizontal drilling as compared to companies that have greater experience in horizontal drilling activities. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, failing to land our wellbore in the desired drilling zone, not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, not running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, not being able to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations and not successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems and/or commodity prices decline, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these\ndevelopments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in our credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Potential disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, significantly change U.S. tax laws, including certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas companies. Such legislative proposals include, but are not limited to: (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation accompanying lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and natural gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $126.3 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), which begin to expire in 2034. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Section 382\"), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \"ownership change\" (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, subject to certain adjustments. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. We cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change in 2017. However, even if we did have an ownership change, in 2017, we do not believe that the resulting Section 382 annual limitation would prevent our utilization of our NOLs prior to their expiration. Future ownership changes or future regulatory changes could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows if we attain profitability.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. However, Texas has endured severe drought conditions during the past several years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to produce oil and natural gas economically, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and of entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.\nIn October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules also will require us, in connection with certain derivatives activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements). To date, the CFTC has only designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for application of such mandatory clearing and trade-execution requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from such requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into swaps outside of mandatory clearing becomes prohibitive, we may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect of the rules and any additional regulations on our business is uncertain at this time.\nIn addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for swaps outside of mandatory clearing. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce our liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and our ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in cash flows.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us or the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivatives, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less\npredictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on us, our financial condition or our results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nWe may not consummate the Double Eagle Acquisition.\nWe may not consummate the Double Eagle Acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or that the Double Eagle Acquisition will be consummated.\nIf the Double Eagle Acquisition is delayed or terminated, the price of our Class A Common Stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our Class A Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the Double Eagle Acquisition will be consummated on the terms described herein.\nIf the Double Eagle Acquisition is not consummated, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from the February Offering and the New 2025 Notes Offering in ways that you or other stockholders may not approve, and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nIf the Double Eagle Acquisition is consummated, we may be unable to successfully integrate Double Eagle\u2019s operations or to realize anticipated cost savings, revenues or other benefits of the Double Eagle Acquisition.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Double Eagle Acquisition, if consummated, will depend in part upon whether we can integrate Double Eagle\u2019s assets and operations into our existing business in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully. The successful acquisition of producing properties, including those acquired from Double Eagle, requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture natural gas and oil prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of transportation of production to markets;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of drilling equipment and of skilled personnel;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities; and\n\u2022\nregulatory, permitting and similar matters.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we have performed, and will continue to perform, a review of the subject properties, including properties that are subject to certain customary acreage swaps in process, that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections will not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even if problems are identified, the contractual protection provided with respect to all or a portion of the underlying deficiencies may prove ineffective or insufficient. The integration process may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired properties will perform in accordance with our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration or cost savings as a result of the Double Eagle Acquisition will materialize. Significant acquisitions, including the Double Eagle Acquisition, and other strategic transactions may involve other risks that may cause our business to suffer, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe challenge and cost of integrating acquired assets and operations with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business; and\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nWe are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our equity interest in Parsley LLC and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Parsley LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the TRA and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our equity interest in Parsley LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Parsley LLC has available cash, we intend to cause Parsley LLC to make distributions to its unit holders, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates and payments under the TRA and to reimburse us for our corporate and other overhead expenses. We are limited, however, in our ability to cause Parsley LLC and its subsidiaries to make these and other distributions to us due to the restrictions under our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. To the extent that we need funds and Parsley LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur management collectively holds a significant percentage of the voting power of our common stock.\nHolders of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. As of December 31, 2016, our executive officers hold approximately 20.9% of our outstanding equity interests. The existence of this significant management ownership position may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nSo long as our management team continues to control a significant percentage of the voting power of our common stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of our management team may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies, as described under the caption \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence.\"\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating any payments due under our Revolving Credit Agreement and the TRA, and could, in certain defined circumstances, accelerate payments required by the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see \"-In certain cases, payments under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\"\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock, and our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Class A Common Stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your\nClass A Common Stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A Common Stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price at which you purchased your shares of Class A Common Stock.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock in subsequent offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock will have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock.\nOn May 27, 2014, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of 12,727,273 shares of our Class A Common Stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration or waiver of lock-up agreements and the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 are available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nOn March 11, 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-1 providing for the registration of 14,885,797 shares of our Class A Common Stock in connection with a private placement of such Class A Common Stock at a price of $15.50 per share to selected institutional investors. On June 5, 2015, we filed an automatically effective registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 providing for the continued registration of such shares of our Class A Common Stock, which are available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction, as well as the registration of additional shares of our Class A Common Stock and certain other of our securities.\nWe are required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nThe PE Unit Holders generally have the right to exchange their PE Units (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock), for shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Class A Common Stock for each PE Unit (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock) exchanged (subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications), or, if either we or Parsley LLC so elects, cash.\nWe have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with Parsley LLC and the PE Unit Holders and certain other holders of equity interests in us. This agreement generally provides for the payment by us to a TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise tax that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after our IPO as a result of (i) any tax basis increases resulting from the contribution in connection with our IPO by such TRA Holder of all or a portion of its PE Units to us in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) the tax basis increases resulting from the exchange by such TRA Holder of PE Units for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Right (or resulting from an exchange of PE Units for cash pursuant to the Cash Option) and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return.\nFor purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing our actual tax liability to the amount we would have been required to pay had we not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the completion of our IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement by making the termination payment specified in the agreement.\nThe actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of the exchanges of PE Units, the price of Class A Common Stock at the time of each exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest or depletable, depreciable or amortizable basis. We expect that the payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for which we will be dependent on Parsley LLC, could be substantial.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of Parsley LLC. However, we are a holding company with no independent means of generating revenue. Therefore, to the extent Parsley LLC has available cash, we intend to cause Parsley LLC to make distributions to its unit holders, including us, in an amount sufficient to cover all such obligations. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in us.\nIn certain cases, payments under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\nIf we elect to terminate the TRA early or it is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or due to a material breach of the TRA, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits subject to the TRA, for which we would be dependent on Parsley LLC. The calculation of anticipated future tax benefits will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events as set forth in the TRA, including the assumption that we have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize such benefits and that any PE Units that the PE Unit Holders or their permitted transferees own on the termination date are deemed to be exchanged on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future benefits.\nIn these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control due to the additional transaction costs a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. For example, if the TRA were terminated at December 31, 2016, the estimated termination payment would be approximately $322.3 million (calculated using a discount rate equal to LIBOR, plus 300 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of $660.6 million). The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ materially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRA.\nPayments under the TRA will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The holders of rights under the TRA will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the TRA if such basis increases or other benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any such holder will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, to such holder after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A Common Stock.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm issue an attestation report on such internal control. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 14634, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PE"}
