{"cik": "1166380", "company": "QUANTUM FUEL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES WORLDWIDE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThis Annual Report, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We face a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances in the future or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We discuss all known material risks to our business below. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, our financial condition or our results of operations could suffer significantly.\nRisks Related to Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows and we may need to raise additional funds to finance our operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative operating cash flows. We incurred net losses from continuing operations before income taxes of $14.5 million and $20.0 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe have significantly improved our liquidity position over the past couple of months and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover existing operations and obligations through at least December 31, 2015, and a long-term strategy in place that will allow us to operate profitably in the future. However, if we fail to execute our strategy or if there is a change in the market conditions or any other assumptions we used in formulating our liquidity analysis and business strategy, our liquidity analysis may not be accurate and our long-term strategy may not be successful in achieving profitability. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our company and the value of our common stock could decline.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness or refinance or extend such indebtedness, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $16.9 million of principal and interest owing under our debt obligations related to our continuing operations and $19.6 million in debt financing associated with the discontinued operations of Schneider Power's 10.0 MW Zephyr wind farm that is classified as held for sale. Our debt related to our continuing operations includes $1.6 million owed to a finance company that is secured by specific equipment assets, $4.5 million owed to our senior secured lender, which is secured by substantially all of our assets used in continuing operations, and $10.7 million owed to convertible note holders that have a second lien position on substantially all of our assets used in continuing operations.\nIf we do not have sufficient capital to repay these obligations when they become due or if we cannot otherwise refinance these debt obligations prior to their maturity, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to raise capital in the future and our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, if we were to default on the secured debt, the lenders would have the right as secured creditors to foreclose on the assets securing the debt.\nOur revolving line of credit facility with our senior secured lender contains certain affirmative and negative covenants which could restrict the manner in which we conduct business and, if we fail to comply with such covenants, it could restrict our ability to access the full amount available under the credit facility and result in the acceleration of the debt extended, if any, pursuant to such credit facility.\nOur credit facility with our senior secured lender, as last amended on February 10, 2015, provides us with a $7.5 million line of credit and is secured by substantially all of the assets used in our continuing operations, contains certain financial covenants and other restrictions applicable to us which could reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations by limiting our ability to borrow money and may create a risk of default on our debt if we cannot continue to satisfy these covenants.\nIf we default in any of the affirmative or negative covenants applicable to us or otherwise default in the credit facility, the lender could, among other things, declare a default, accelerate the maturity date of any outstanding indebtedness and, if we are unable to repay, exercise its rights under the credit facility to, among other things, foreclose on our assets.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to our Fuel Storage and Systems Segment\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers.\nA large percentage of our revenue is typically derived from a small number of customers. Revenues from our largest customer comprised 28% and 45% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and revenues from our top three customers comprised 51% and 66% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. In the event there is an unfavorable change in our business relationship with our significant customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur business plan is focused on CNG and our expectations regarding revenue growth for calendar 2015 is based on a number of assumptions, which if incorrect, would have a material effect on our actual revenues and our business.\nOur business plan for calendar 2015 is highly focused and dependent on CNG and contemplates that our revenues from CNG fuel storage tanks and fuel module systems will increase significantly from historical levels, and our business strategy contemplates continued growth in the CNG vehicle segment. We are currently estimating that our total revenue for 2015 will exceed our total revenue for 2014 by approximately 40% to 50%. We base our estimate for total revenue on a number of\nassumptions including, without limitation, that market growth for CNG trucks and demand for our CNG fuel storage products will continue to increase, that our relationships with our customers will continue for the foreseeable future, that the cost of natural gas will continue to be lower than gasoline and diesel by an amount that justifies conversion to CNG, the decision by fleet managers to switch to CNG and whether we can maintain a competitive advantage over our competitors. In the event that any of our assumptions are inaccurate, it could have a material effect on our business plan and projected revenues for calendar 2015.\nFuel price differentials are difficult to predict and may be less favorable in the future. If the price of natural gas does not remain sufficiently below the prices of gasoline and diesel, potential customers will have less incentive to purchase natural gas vehicles, which would limit our growth.\nThe growth of the natural gas vehicle market, CNG adoption rates, and our ability to grow the business depends in large part on the price differential between natural gas, diesel and gasoline fuels. Natural gas vehicles cost more than comparable gasoline or diesel powered vehicles because the components needed for a vehicle to use natural gas add to a vehicle\u2019s base cost. If the price of natural gas does not remain sufficiently below the prices of gasoline and diesel, operators may delay the purchase of natural gas vehicles or decide not to convert their existing vehicles to run on natural gas because of a perceived inability to recover the additional costs of acquiring or converting to natural gas vehicles in a timely manner. Natural gas has generally been, and currently is, less expensive than diesel fuel in many jurisdictions; however, the price differential has decreased over the past several months. The price differential is affected by many factors, including changes in domestic and foreign supplies of natural gas and crude oil, availability of shale gas, domestic storage levels, pipeline transportation capacity for natural gas, refining capacity for crude oil, weather conditions, level of consumer demand, economic conditions, and domestic and foreign government regulations (including, without limitation, excise and fuel tax policies) and political conditions. There can be no assurance that natural gas will remain less expensive than diesel and gasoline fuels. Any decrease in the cost savings offered by the use of natural gas vehicles could result in fewer purchases of or conversions to natural gas vehicles, which would cause our customer base and our sales of fuel storage systems and services to decrease and our business to suffer.\nAdvanced Green Innovations, LLC (\u201cAGI\u201d) and its affiliate ZHRO Solutions, LLC (\u201cZHRO\u201d) recent default in the terms of a Debt Repayment Agreement could materially affect our business and financial results.\nAGI, and its affiliate, ZHRO owe us approximately $2.8 million for engineering, design and development services as of December 31, 2014, of which $2.2 million was invoiced by us through October 3, 2014, and $0.6 million represented unbilled receivables as of October 3, 2014. On December 11, 2014, we, AGI, ZHRO and their affiliate, Advanced Green Technologies, LLC (\u201cAGT\u201d), entered into a Debt Repayment Agreement and Pledge Agreement with respect to the $2.2 million of billed receivables. AGI and ZHRO are currently in default of the terms of the Debt Repayment Agreement due to their failure to timely make the $300,000 payment due on December 25, 2014, the $200,000 payment due on January 31, 2015, and the $200,000 payment due on February 28, 2015. To date, AGI and ZHRO have paid us $150,000 of the $700,000 due under the Debt Repayment Agreement.\nWhile we continue to believe that AGI will be able to raise sufficient capital to continue their operations and pay the amounts owed to us or that we will be able to recover all or a substantial portion of the amount owed to us by AGI and ZHRO from the collateral securing the obligation, if they are unsuccessful in raising sufficient capital or if we are unable to sell or otherwise realize an amount on the collateral sufficient to repay the amount owed to us, we may have to specifically reserve and/or write-off amounts owed to us if we determine in the future that the amounts may not be fully realizable and such write-off would have a material impact on our liquidity. The collateral that we received to secure AGI\u2019s and ZHRO\u2019s performance of their obligations under the Debt Repayment Agreement is comprised of all of AGI\u2019s and AGT\u2019s ownership interests in East Camelback, LLC, consisting of 510 voting units (51.0%), 474 non-voting units and 47.5% of the participation rights in East Camelback, LLC. East Camelback, LLC indirectly owns 100% of a commercial building, consisting of approximately 23,700 square feet of office space, located in Phoenix, Arizona. Given the nature of the collateral, if we foreclose on the collateral, we cannot provide any assurance of when we would be able to sell or otherwise monetize the foreclosed collateral or how much we would be able to realize upon the sale of such collateral. In addition, if AGI or ZHRO were to become subject to bankruptcy proceedings, our preference in the collateral could be avoided, and we could lose the benefit of the security on the collateral.\nIf Iroquois Master Fund\u2019s appeal is successful, we may have to pay them additional damages and legal fees.\nOn December 15, 2014, Iroquois Master Fund (\u201cIroquois\u201d) filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Although we believe that we will prevail on appeal, we can provide no assurance that the Second Circuit will uphold District Court\u2019s judgment. If the Second Circuit were to reverse the District Court\u2019s decision, then we may have to pay Iroquois additional damages and reimburse them for their reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the appeal.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for the supply of materials and components used in our products and storage systems, some of which are single sourced. An interruption in this supply or switching to an alternative material or component could adversely affect our ability to deliver our storage systems and tanks.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for the supply of materials and components. Certain of these suppliers are single source. Any significant change in a material or component could require us to revalidate a tank or storage system which would cause delays due to re-validation or re-certification of the storage system. In the event these delays are lengthy and that the cost of these materials and/or components increase or our suppliers experience production delays or constraints, it could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to design and manufacture fuel systems that can be integrated into vehicle platforms is critical to our business.\nWe are currently manufacturing, integrating or developing CNG fuel storage systems for production vehicles and aftermarket programs. These CNG fuel storage systems are engineered to meet strict design, performance and packaging requirements of our customers. Customers for these systems require that these products meet either their strict design standards or original equipment manufacturer level standards that can vary by jurisdiction. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in increased development, manufacturing, warranty and administrative costs. A significant increase in these costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to meet original equipment manufacturer or customer specifications on a timely basis, our existing or future relationships with our original equipment manufacturers and other customers may be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA mass market for our CNG systems may never develop or may take longer to develop than anticipated.\nCNG systems represent emerging technologies, and we do not know whether users will adopt these technologies on a large scale or whether original equipment manufacturers will incorporate these technologies into their products. In particular, if a mass market fails to develop, or develops more slowly than anticipated, for CNG and other alternative fuel propulsion systems in vehicle applications, we may be unable to recover our expenditures to develop our fuel systems and may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability, any of which could negatively impact our business. Many factors that are beyond our control may have a negative effect on the development of a mass market for CNG and our fuel systems for CNG applications.\nThese factors include the following:\n\u2022\ncost competitiveness, especially with fluctuating oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nconsumer acceptance of CNG fuel products;\n\u2022\ngovernment funding and support for the development of CNG and related fueling infrastructure;\n\u2022\nconsumer adoption levels of CNG compared to liquid natural gas (LNG) as a preferred natural gas fuel choice;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of original equipment manufacturers and after-market integrators and customers to replace current technology;\n\u2022\nconsumer perceptions of CNG;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nemergence of newer, breakthrough technologies and products within the vehicle industry.\nEvolving customer design requirements, product specifications and testing procedures could cause order delays or cancellations.\nWe have experienced delays in shipping our products in the past as a result of changing customer specifications and testing procedures. Due to the dynamic nature of the technologies used in our products, changes in specifications are common and may result in delayed shipments, order cancellations or higher production costs. Evolving design requirements or product specifications may adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing fuel systems on a large scale basis.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing CNG and other alternative fuel systems in high volumes. In order to produce our CNG and other alternative fuel propulsion systems at affordable prices on a large scale basis, we will have to continue to enhance and automate our manufacturing processes. We do not know whether we, or our suppliers, will be able to develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capability and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, or production volumes required to successfully mass market our products. Even if we, or our suppliers, are successful in developing our high volume manufacturing capability and processes, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in time to meet our product commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of our customers. Our failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not meet our product development and commercialization milestones.\nWe have certain product development programs that are in the pre-commercial stage. The success of each product development program is highly dependent on our correct interpretation of commercial market requirements, and our translation of those requirements into applicable product specifications and appropriate development milestones. If we have misinterpreted market requirements, or if the requirements of the market change, we may develop a product that does not meet the cost and performance requirements for a successful commercial product. In addition, if we do not meet the required development milestones, our commercialization schedules could be delayed, which could result in potential purchasers of these products declining to purchase additional systems or choosing to purchase alternative technologies. Delayed commercialization schedules may also impact our cash flow, which could require increased funding.\nWe may be subject to warranty claims, and our provision for warranty costs may not be sufficient.\nWe may be subject to increased warranty claims for our products due to increased levels of our products that are in use and subject to existing warranty provisions and due to longer warranty periods. In response to consumer demand, vehicle manufacturers have been providing, and may continue to provide, increasingly longer warranty periods for their products. As a consequence, these manufacturers may require their suppliers, such as us, to provide correspondingly longer product warranties. As a result, we could incur substantially greater warranty claims in the future.\nOur business may be subject to product liability claims or product recalls, which could be expensive and could result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nThe automotive industry experiences significant product liability claims. As a supplier of products and systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket system integrators, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products, or the equipment into which our products are incorporated, malfunction and result in personal injury or death. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our systems or components caused the accidents. Product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages. The sale of systems and components for the transportation industry entails a high risk of these claims. In addition, we may be required to participate in recalls involving these systems if any of our systems prove to be defective, or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships. Our other products may also be subject to product liability claims or recalls. We cannot assure you that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur business may become subject to stricter product certification regulations, which may impair our ability to market and sell our products.\nWe must meet product certification requirements from regulated agencies such as NGV2 and other governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, and comply with requirements from the U.S. Department of Transportation, in order to sell certain of our products in the United States and internationally. A significant portion of our future sales will depend upon sales of fuel system products that are certified to meet existing on-board fuel storage safety codes and standards. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to meet these specifications and standards. The failure to comply with these certification and safety requirements and standards could result in the recall of our products or in civil or criminal penalties.\nAny new government regulation that affects our advanced fuel technologies, whether at the foreign, federal, state or local level, including any regulations relating to installation and servicing of these systems, may increase our costs and the price of our systems. As a result, these regulations may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental policies could hurt the market for our products and our renewable energy projects.\nThe market for natural gas, plug-in electric hybrid, fuel cell, hybrid and other forms of alternative fuel vehicles and equipment and the demand for our products are driven, to a significant degree, by local, state and federal regulations that relate to air quality, greenhouse gases and pollutants, and that require the purchase of motor vehicles and equipment operating on alternative fuels or fuel cells. Similarly, foreign governmental regulations also affect our international business. These laws and regulations may change, which could result in transportation or equipment manufacturers abandoning or delaying their interest in alternative fuel and fuel cell powered vehicles or equipment. In addition, a failure by authorities to enforce current domestic and foreign laws or to adopt additional environmental laws could limit the demand for our products.\nAlthough many governments have identified as a significant priority the development of alternative energy sources, and fuel cells in particular, we cannot assure you that governments will not change their priorities or that any change they make would not materially affect our revenue or the development of our products.\nFailure to comply with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and harm our results of operations.\nWe use hazardous materials in our research and development and manufacturing processes, and as a result are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and hazardous waste products that we generate. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, including a discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our insurance and other resources. We have also incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to compliance with environmental laws. Such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that the cost of complying with these laws and regulations will not materially increase in the future.\nWe are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including new or revised safety or environmental standards, could give rise to significant liability and require us to incur substantial expenses and could materially harm our results of operations.\nWe currently face, and will continue to face, significant competition, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe currently compete with companies that have or may have greater economic resources, name recognition, larger customer bases, broader global reach and a wider array of product lines. We are also subject to competition from other alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), synthetic fuel, methanol, ethanol, hydraulic hybrid, hybrid, hybrid electric and fuel cells, and we cannot assure you that such technologies will not be favored over gaseous fuel technologies in the future. We also cannot assure you that our competitors will not create new and improved innovative gaseous fuel technologies. Increases in the market for alternative fuel vehicles may cause automobile or engine manufacturers to develop and produce their own fuel conversion or fuel management equipment rather than purchasing the equipment from suppliers such as us or to employ competing technologies. Further, greater acceptance of alternative fuel engines may result in new competitors. Should any of these events occur, either alone or in combination, the total potential demand for, and pricing of, our products could be negatively affected and cause us to lose business, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nNew competitors and new technologies are emerging and could negatively impact our market sure and prospects for future business.\nNew emerging competitors and developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete. A range of other technologies could compete with and/or replace our CNG, hydrogen and hybrid electric products and technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to design, develop and market new or modified CNG and hydrogen products and systems. Our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies, conform to increasingly stringent emission standards and performance requirements and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position. New product development or modification is costly, involves significant research, development, time and expense and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products.\nRisks Related to Investments and our Renewable Energy Segment\nWe may be unable to effectuate a sale of Schneider Power assets in a timely manner or receive consideration that exceeds the carrying value of the assets that are currently held for sale.\nOn August 9, 2012, we committed to a formal plan to sell the assets and operations of our Schneider Power business and initiated steps to locate a buyer. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in selling the assets or operations for a price in excess of the carrying value of the assets that are currently classified as \u201cheld for sale,\u201d if at all. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $0.9 million of impairment charges related to Schneider Power\u2019s assets that are held for sale. In the event we are unable to sell Schneider Power for a price at least equal to the remaining carrying value of the assets, then we will have to record additional charges and the amount of the charges could be material.\nOur Renewable Energy business segment has a substantial amount of debt and Schneider Power has pledged all of its ownership interests in Zephyr Farms Limited to secure project related debt.\nThe $19.6 million in project debt financing associated with the discontinued operations of Schneider Power that is classified as held for sale represents term debt principal and accrued interest owed by Zephyr Farms Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, to Samsung Heavy Industries Ltd (The Samsung Debt). The Samsung Debt is secured by substantially all of Zephyr Farm Limited\u2019s assets and guaranteed by Schneider Power, the parent company of Zephyr Farms Limited, pursuant to the terms of a limited nonrecourse guarantee. Schneider Power\u2019s guarantee of the Samsung Debt is secured by a pledge of all of the shares of Zephyr Farms Limited pursuant to the terms of a Pledge Agreement. If the Zephyr Wind Farm does not generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to service the Samsung Debt, Samsung would have the rights of a secured creditor to foreclose on the project assets and/or take ownership of the project. If Zephyr Farms Limited were to default on the Samsung Debt and Samsung were to exercise its rights as a secured creditor, it would have a material adverse effect on Schneider Power and our Renewable Energy business segment.\nSchneider Power's 10.0 MW Zephyr Wind Farm could generate less return than anticipated.\nWe have experienced delays and difficulties in bringing the Zephyr Wind Farm project\u2019s energy generation capabilities up to full utilization. If difficulties are encountered in the future, the levels of energy generated over the expected life of the project\u2019s assets could be significantly less than expected, the operating results of the renewable energy segment could be negatively impacted, our ability to meet or restructure the Samsung Debt could be impaired, and we may not be able to realize the level of proceeds that we anticipate from a sale of the Zephyr Wind Farm.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success.\nOur failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of our competitive advantage or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation, and/or be enjoined from using such intellectual property.\nWe have not conducted formal evaluations to confirm that our technology and products do not or will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we cannot be certain that our technology and products do not or will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. If infringement were to occur, our development, manufacturing, sales and distribution of such technology or products may be disrupted.\nWe rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any of the patents we have filed or other patents that third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable, or licensed to others or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage we seek, if issued at all.\nEffective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries. For instance, it may be difficult for us to enforce certain of our intellectual property rights against third parties who may have inappropriately acquired interests in our intellectual property rights by filing unauthorized trademark applications in foreign countries to register our marks because of their familiarity with our business in the United States.\nSome of our proprietary intellectual property is not protected by any patent, copyright or patent or copyright applications, and, despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use such intellectual property without authorization. We have generally sought to protect such proprietary intellectual property in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with strategic partners and employees, although such agreements have not been put in place in every instance. We cannot guarantee that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property or proprietary rights. In addition, we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships. Furthermore, the steps we have taken and may take in the future may not prevent\nmisappropriation of our solutions or technologies, particularly in respect of officers and employees who are no longer employed by us or in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and maintain key personnel.\nOur future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including engineers, technicians, machinists and management personnel. For example, our research and development efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers. Competition for highly skilled engineers is extremely intense, and we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified engineers in many areas of our business. Our future also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel, could delay product development cycles or otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient.\nWe carry insurance that we consider adequate in regard to the nature of the covered risks and the costs of coverage. We are not fully insured against all possible risks, nor are all such risks insurable.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls.\nAny failure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and the NASDAQ Capital Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nKevin Douglas and his affiliates could have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 13, 2015, Kevin Douglas and his affiliates (the \u201cDouglas Family\u201d) held convertible notes and warrants entitling them to purchase up to 7,298,575 shares of our common stock (without taking into account any beneficial ownership limitations provisions contained in the convertible notes and warrants held by the Douglas Family), which represents approximately 20.7% on an \"as-if converted\" basis and 17.8% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. The conversion price for the convertible notes is $2.3824 per share and the exercise price for the warrants is $2.30 per share. If the Douglas Family were to convert its convertible notes and/or exercise its warrants, it would have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of the Douglas Family. In addition, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders that have the ability to exercise significant control.\nOur stockholders are subject to significant dilution upon the occurrence of certain events which could result in a decrease in our stock price.\nAs of March 13, 2015, we had 4,396,823 shares reserved for issuance upon the conversion of convertible notes with a conversion price of $2.3824 per share, 451,976 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options with exercise prices ranging from $2.23 to $178.40 per share and 8,327,405 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of warrants with exercise prices ranging from $2.30 to $154.40 per share, respectively. The issuance of shares upon conversion of the convertible notes exercise of the warrants and/or options will be dilutive to our stockholders, and any sales of such shares could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been volatile. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors described in this report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance. In recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the market price and trading volume of our common stock. Prices for our common stock may also be influenced by the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock, investor perceptions about us and our business, our future financial results, the absence of cash dividends on our common stock and general economic and market conditions. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management and other resources.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on your investment.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and payment of cash dividends on our common stock, if any, will also depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of our credit facility, as amended, with our senior secured lender we are prohibited from declaring or making any dividends as long as the credit facility remains in effect. Accordingly, the success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares, and you may not realize a return on your investment in our securities.\nProvisions of Delaware law and of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may make a takeover or change in control more difficult.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and of Delaware corporate law, may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that our management and board of directors oppose. Public stockholders that might desire to participate in one of these transactions may not have an opportunity to do so. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide for the following:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors, which makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of the board of directors to change the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board of directors, which could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock, which could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to obtain voting control of us;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations or other proposals at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which could delay a third party from pursuing an acquisition; and\n\u2022\nrequiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock to amend certain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and requiring the affirmative vote of 80% of our outstanding voting stock to amend certain other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which could make it more difficult for a third party to remove the provisions we have included to prevent or delay a change of control.", "PERMNO": 89452, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "QTWWQ"}
