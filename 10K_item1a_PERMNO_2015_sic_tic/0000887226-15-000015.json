{"cik": "887226", "company": "PERCEPTRON INC/MI", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks. Any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that adversely affect our business in the future. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties we face are as follows:\nOur revenues are highly influenced by the sale of products for use in the global automotive market, particularly by manufacturers based in the United States, China, and Western Europe. These manufacturers have experienced periodic downturns in their businesses that could adversely affect their level of purchases of our products.\nDue to our significant revenue from the automotive industry, our ability to sell our systems and solutions to automotive manufacturers and suppliers is affected by periodic downturns in the global automotive industry, such as those that occurred in 2009-2010 in the United States automotive industry.\nNew vehicle tooling programs are the most important selling opportunity for our automotive-related sales. The number and timing of new vehicle tooling programs can be influenced by a number of economic factors. Our customers only launch a limited number of new car programs in any given year because of the time and financial resources required. From a macro perspective we continue to assess the global economy and its likely effect on our automotive customers and markets served. We continue to view the automotive industry\u2019s focus on introducing new vehicles more frequently to satisfy their customers\u2019 changing requirements, as well as their continuing focus on improved quality, as positive indicators for new business. However, because of periodic economic downturns experienced by our customers, our customers could determine to reduce their number of new car programs. The automobile industry is a very cost competitive industry. Pricing pressures could adversely affect the margins we realize on the sale of our products, and ultimately, our profitability.\nThe Company has embarked on a strategy to grow its business through diversification into other non-automotive manufacturing sectors where the Company believes significant opportunity exists for the Company\u2019s existing and new products. Because of the inherent difficulties in diversification, the Company may not be successful in its efforts. See \u201cOur future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy.\u201d\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur revenue levels are impacted by global economic conditions, as we have a significant business in many countries throughout the world. In fiscal 2015, 38% of sales were generated in North America and as a result, a significant decline in global economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCurrent levels of market volatility adversely impact the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. During such a period, the volatility and disruption could reach unprecedented levels, which would exert downward pressures on stock prices, including the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy.\nOur future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term strategy that includes growing our customer base in the automotive market and expanding into new markets. We have embarked on a diversification strategy to expand into non-automotive markets through our existing and new products. However, there are a number of uncertainties involved in our long-term strategy over which we have no or limited control, including:\n\u2022The quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future.\n\u2022The level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in our existing and new products and technologies.\n\u2022Our ability to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies.\n\u2022Our ability to identify and satisfy market needs.\n\u2022Our ability to identify satisfactory distribution networks.\n\u2022General product development and commercialization difficulties.\n\u2022Rapid or unexpected technological changes.\n\u2022General product demand and market acceptance risks.\n\u2022Our ability to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies.\n\u2022Our ability to attract the appropriate personnel to effectively represent, install and service our products.\n\u2022The effect of economic conditions.\nEven if we are able to expand our customer base and markets, the new revenues we derive may not offset declines in revenues from our current products. We also may not be able to generate profits from these new customers or markets at the same level as we generate from our current business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our customer base and markets or successfully execute our strategies in a fashion to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.\nA significant percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of customers, so that the loss of any one of these customers could result in a significant reduction in our revenues and profits.\nA majority of our revenues in fiscal 2015 were derived from the sale of systems and solutions to a small number of customers that consist primarily of automotive manufacturers and suppliers in North America, Western Europe and Asia.\nWith such a large percentage of our revenues coming from such a small and highly concentrated group of customers, we are susceptible to a substantial risk of losing revenues if these customers stop purchasing our products or reduce their purchases of our products. In addition, we have no control over whether these customers will continue to purchase our products, systems and solutions in volumes or at prices sufficient to generate profits for us.\nOur future commercial success depends upon our ability to maintain a competitive technological position in our markets, which are characterized by continual technological change.\nTechnology plays a key role in the systems and solutions that we produce. Our ability to sell our products to customers is directly influenced by the technology used in our systems and solutions. With the rapid pace at which technology is changing, there is a possibility that our customers may require more technologically advanced systems and solutions than what we may be capable of producing.\nTechnological developments could render actual and proposed products or technologies of ours uneconomical or obsolete. There also is a possibility that we may not be able to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 products. In that case, our competitors may make technological improvements to their products that make them more desirable than our products.\nOur growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products that include the latest technological advances and customer requirements. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or achieve market acceptance for such products. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, we believe that our future commercial success will depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce new cost-effective products and maintain a competitive technological position.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology. If our competitors develop competing products that do not violate our intellectual property rights or successfully challenge those rights, our revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur products contain features that are protected by patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and contractual rights. Despite these protections, there is still a chance that competitors may use these protected features in their products as a result of our inability to keep our trade secrets confidential, or in violation of our intellectual property rights or following a successful challenge to those rights. The prosecution of infringement claims against third parties and the defense of legal actions challenging our intellectual property rights could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations.\nThere also is a chance that competitors may develop technology that performs the same functions as our products without infringing upon our exclusive rights. It is possible that competitors may reverse engineer those features of our products that are not protected by patents, trademarks and trade secrets. If a competitor is able to reverse engineer an unprotected feature successfully, the competitor may gain an understanding of how the feature works and introduce similar products to compete with our products.\nBecause our products are sold globally, we are at risk of competitors misappropriating our intellectual property included in those products or reverse engineering those products. As a result, we may have a more limited ability, and significantly greater costs, to enforce our intellectual property rights in those products. Constant technological improvement of those products will be particularly important to keep the products competitive in their markets.\nFrom time to time, we make \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d regarding our business, including our future revenues, order bookings, backlog and operating results. Because these \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d are based on estimates and assumptions, actual results could be materially different.\nFrom time to time, we make \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our expectations as to its future new order bookings, revenue, expenses, net income and backlog levels, trends affecting our future revenue levels, the rate of new orders, the timing of revenue and income from new products which we have recently released or have not yet released, and the timing of the introduction of new products. When we use words such as \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprospects\u201d, \u201coutlook\u201d or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for our forward-looking statements. While we believe that our forward-looking statements are reasonable, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.\nBecause these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different. Factors that might cause such a difference include, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those listed in \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. Other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Except as required by applicable law, we do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to publicly update or alter our statements whether as a result of new information, events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or otherwise.\nOur expectations regarding future bookings and revenues are projections developed based upon information from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, customer data and discussions. These projections are subject to change based upon a wide variety of factors. Certain of these new orders have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future. Because our products are typically integrated into larger systems or lines, the timing of new orders is dependent on the timing of completion of the overall system or line. In addition, because our products have shorter lead times than other components and are required later in the process, orders for products tend to be given later in the integration process.\nA significant portion of our projected revenues and net income depends upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products, expand into new geographic markets, successfully negotiate new sales or supply agreements with new customers and otherwise continue sales with current and new customers.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies and are translated for financial reporting purposes into U.S. dollars, the level of our reported new order bookings, revenues, operating profits, net income and order backlog are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, principally between the U.S. Dollar, euro, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen. Currency exchange rates are subject to significant fluctuations, due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions in the United States and other countries. Because our expectations regarding future revenues, order bookings, backlog and operating results are based upon assumptions as to the levels of such currency exchange rates, actual results could differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to lawsuits and other claims arising out of our business operations. Adverse judgments in one or more of these lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts. The outcome of lawsuits is inherently uncertain and typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated or accrued by us relating to lawsuits. Accordingly, if the outcome of a legal proceeding is adverse to the Company, we would have to record a charge for the matter at the time the legal proceeding is resolved and generally in the full amount at which it is resolved. In addition, the expenses related to these lawsuits may be significant. Lawsuits can have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, particularly where we have not established an accrual or a sufficient accrual for damages, settlements, or expenses. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Litigation and Other Contingencies\u201d below for a discussion of the Company\u2019s policies in accounting for lawsuits and other claims.\nWe could become involved in costly litigation alleging patent infringement.\nIn the past, we had been informed that certain of our customers have received allegations of possible patent infringement involving processes and methods used in our products. Certain of these customers, including one customer who was a party to a patent infringement suit relating to this matter, settled such claims. We believe that the processes used in our products were independently developed without utilizing any\nprevious patented process or technology. However, it is possible that in the future we or our customers could receive allegations of possible patent infringement or could be parties to patent infringement litigation relating to our products.\nThe defense of patent infringement litigation could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations.\nThere are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices.\nWe are aware of a number of companies in our markets selling products using similar or alternative technologies and methods. We believe that there may be other companies, some of whom may be substantially larger and have substantially greater resources than us, which may be engaged in the development of technology and products for some of our markets that could prove to be competitive with ours. We believe that the principal competitive factor in our markets is the total capability that a product offers. In some markets, a competitive price for the level of functionality and reliability provided are the principal competitive factors. While we believe that our products compete favorably, it is possible that these competitors could capture some of our sales opportunities or force us to reduce prices in order to complete the sale.\nWe believe that certain existing and potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology. This could cause a decline in sales of our products to those customers.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends in large part upon the continued service of our executives and key employees, including those in engineering, technical, sales and marketing positions, as well as our ability to attract such additional employees in the future. At times and in certain geographic markets, competition for the type of highly skilled employees we require can be significant. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract new qualified key employees could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to increase sales of our new product lines depends on our ability to successfully expand our distribution channels.\nWith the acquisition of Coord3 and NMS in fiscal 2015, we expanded our product lines to include the design, manufacture and sale of CMMs. We market our line of CMMs directly to end users and through distributors and resellers. Growth of our sales of this product line will depend upon our ability to expand our distribution channels by identifying, developing and maintaining relationships with distributors and resellers. In addition, our distributors and resellers can potentially sell products offered by our competitors. If we are not able to successfully expand our distribution channels for our CMM products, or if our distributors or resellers do not or are not able to successfully sell our CMM products, our strategic plan to expand our revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to complete business opportunities and acquisitions and our profits could be negatively affected if we do not successfully operate those that we do complete.\nWe will evaluate from time to time business opportunities that fit our strategic plans. There can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or will be able to enter into agreements with identified business opportunities on terms acceptable to us. The Company may incur significant due diligence and legal costs with no assurance that an acquisition or business opportunity will be consummated after incurring these costs. If we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions that fit our strategic plans, we may not be able to fully implement our expansion plans for the Company.\nThere is also no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate businesses that we may acquire due to the significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel, product lines, technologies and operations in a timely and efficient manner. The integration process may require significant attention from management and devotion of resources. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations and impair our relationships with current employees and customers.\nWe intend to finance any such business opportunities from available cash on hand, existing credit facilities, issuance of additional stock or additional sources of financing, as circumstances warrant. We could use a significant portion of our available cash on hand and incur substantial debt or other contingent liabilities in connection with these acquisition opportunities. The issuance of additional equity securities to finance an acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs, debt service requirements or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets. In addition, if the business opportunities do not perform as expected, we could incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles acquired by us. If we are not successful in generating additional profits from these transactions, this dilution and these additional costs could cause our Common Stock price to drop.\nWe are expanding our foreign operations, increasing the possibility that our business could be adversely affected by risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States and are currently implementing a strategy to expand our global operations.\nOur foreign operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in such foreign operations. For instance, we may encounter fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, differences in the level of protection available for our intellectual property, the impact of differences in language and local business and social customs on our ability to market and sell our products in these markets, the inability to recruit qualified personnel in a specific country or region, more stringent employment regulations and local labor conditions and difficulties in repatriating\ncash earned in other countries back to the United States. In addition, we may be affected by U.S. laws and policies that impact foreign trade and investment. Finally, we may be adversely affected by laws and policies imposed by foreign governments in the countries where we have business operations or sell our products. These laws and policies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nBecause of our significant foreign operations, our revenues and profits can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign currencies.\nProducts that we sell in foreign markets are sometimes priced in currency of the country where the customer is located. To the extent that the dollar fluctuates against these foreign currencies, the prices of our products in U.S. dollars also will fluctuate. As a result, our return on the sale of our products may vary based on these fluctuations. Accordingly, we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe face various risks arising from the legal, regulatory and tax requirements imposed on our operations in the various countries in which we conduct our business operations.\nWe are subject to various risks relating to our compliance with existing and new laws, rules and regulations implemented in the countries in which we conduct our business operations, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery, tax, material composition of our products, such as restrictions on lead and other substances, environmental, safety and export control regulations.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or other benefits. As a result of our foreign operations, we may have contact with persons who are considered foreign officials under the FCPA, putting us at an increased risk of potential FCPA violations.\nOur failure or inability to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures or financial or regulatory obligations that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, reputation or ability to conduct business. We may receive audit notices or other inquiries from governmental or regulatory authorities, and we may participate in voluntary disclosure programs, related to legal, regulatory or tax compliance matters. These audits, inquiries or disclosure programs or any non-compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations could result in our incurring material expense, including investigation costs, defense costs, assessments and penalties, or other consequences that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, reputation or ability to conduct business.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy or data protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or many not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state or international privacy or data protection related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection could adversely affect our reputation and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nForeign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. The European Union, for example, traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under its laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection than the United States. Individual European Union member countries have discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of these laws and the penalties for breach and have their own regulators with differing attitudes towards enforcement, which results in varying privacy standards and enforcement risk from country to country.\nBecause a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders, our revenues and profits may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nA large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders that are placed by a small number of customers. If the timing of these orders is delayed from one quarter to the next or from one year to the next, we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results. Because our order terms vary from project to project, the application of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies to those orders can cause the timing for our recognition of revenue from an order to vary significantly between orders. This may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nThe amount of revenues that we earn in any given quarter may vary based in part on the timing of new vehicle programs in the global automotive industry. In contrast, many of our operating expenses are fixed and will not vary from quarter to quarter. As a result, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.\nWe could experience losses in connection with sales of our investments.\nThe Company has a long-term investment that was exchanged for preferred stock of a reinsurance company. This investment has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. The issuer of this security is not obligated to register the security. There is no regular trading market for these securities. As a result, we will have limited ability to liquidate the investment. This lack of liquidity, as well as negative changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security and credit rating, has adversely impacted the value of the security. In the event that the financial condition of the issuer should continue to deteriorate, we may have to record additional impairment charges relating to the security, which would negatively impact our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income. See Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nA significant amount of our assets represents goodwill and intangible assets, and our net income would be reduced if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nAs of June 30, 2015, we had $7.5 million of net goodwill and $6.7 million of net intangible assets. The Company\u2019s acquisition of Coord3 and NMS resulted in goodwill as the cost exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to an impairment analysis at least annually based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Intangible assets relate primarily to trademarks, customer relationships, and software acquired and are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of the intangible asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that any intangible assets or goodwill is impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe trading price of our stock has been volatile.\nThe following factors may affect the market price of our Common Stock, which can vary widely over time:\n\u2022announcements of new products by us;\n\u2022announcements of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022variations in our operating results;\n\u2022market conditions in the electronic and sensing industry and/or automotive industry;\n\u2022market conditions and stock prices in general; and\n\u2022the volume of our Common Stock traded.\nBecause of the limited trading in our Common Stock, it may be difficult for shareholders to dispose of a large number of shares of our Common Stock in a short period of time or at then current prices.\nBecause of the limited number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding and the limited number of holders of our Common Stock, only a limited number of shares of our Common Stock trade on a daily basis. This limited trading in our Common Stock makes it difficult to dispose of a large number of shares in a short period of time. In addition, it is likely that the sale by a shareholder of a large number of shares of our Common Stock over an extended period would depress the price of our Common Stock.\nAs permitted under Michigan law, our directors are not liable to Perceptron for monetary damages resulting from their actions or inactions.\nUnder our articles of incorporation, as permitted under the Michigan Business Corporation Act, members of our Board of Directors are not liable for monetary damages for any negligent or grossly negligent action that the director takes, or for any negligent or grossly negligent failure of a director to take any action. However, a director will remain liable for:\n\u2022intentionally inflicting harm on the Company or its shareholders;\n\u2022distributions that the director makes in violation of the Michigan Business Corporation Act; and\n\u2022intentional criminal acts that the director commits.\nHowever, we or our shareholders may seek an injunction, or other appropriate equitable relief, against a director. Finally, liability may be imposed against members of the Board of Directors under the federal securities laws.\nWe are required to indemnify our officers and directors if they are involved in litigation as a result of their serving as officers or directors of the Company or as officers or directors of other corporations at our behest, which could reduce our profits and cash available to operate our business.\nOur by-laws require us to indemnify our officers and directors. We may be required to pay judgments, fines and expenses incurred by an officer or director, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, as a result of actions or proceedings in which such officers or directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of the Company or other corporations at our behest.\nFunds paid in satisfaction of judgments, fines and expenses would reduce our profits and may be funds we need for the operation of our business and the development of products. This could cause our stock price to drop.\nA change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the future valuation of our deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the United States and are dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the United States; the geographic composition of our pre-tax income and the various tax rates in those countries; changes in available tax credits, changes in tax laws and rates, and the repatriation of earnings from outside the United States for which we have not previously provided for United States taxes. A change in our effective tax rate can adversely impact our net income.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including Germany, Italy and China. In determining our provisions for income taxes, we make judgments regarding various tax positions reported on our tax returns. As a result, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax returns are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Because of these uncertain tax positions, the final determination of these tax audits could be materially different than is reflected in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our provisions for income taxes, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur profits could be reduced as a result of our compliance with SEC rules relating to our internal control over financial reporting.\nCurrent SEC rules require our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements to provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports.\nFor the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Company was not required to have an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls. Because the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $75 million at December 31, 2013, we have to comply with these requirements in fiscal year 2014 and thereafter. We may have to expend significant resources in future fiscal years in connection with ongoing compliance with these requirements, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIf management is not able to provide a positive report on our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is not able to provide an unqualified opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting, shareholders and others may lose confidence in our financial statements, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nBecause of our relatively small size, we are unable to have financial personnel in positions that are devoted solely to internal controls over financial reporting. However, management has had a continuous program in effect to evaluate and test internal controls through the utilization of outside, independent accountants.\nIn fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2015, management provided positive reports on our internal control over financial reporting and we received in fiscal 2008, 2014 and 2015 an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2013, our auditors were not required to give an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting following SEC rules for companies that had a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates that was less than $75 million as of the companies\u2019 second fiscal quarter in any given fiscal year. The Company\u2019s Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $75 million at December 31, 2013. Accordingly, we have complied with these requirements beginning in fiscal year 2014.\nIn fiscal 2016, we will have to begin to comply with these requirements for our newly acquired subsidiaries, Coord3 and NMS, which could result in additional expenses if this involves more effort or outside resources than is currently expected.\nThere can be no positive assurance that, in the future, management will provide a positive report on our internal control over financial reporting. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could cause our stock price to drop.\nOur operations could be disrupted and our profits reduced as a result of difficulties encountered in the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system.\nThe Company is in the process of implementing a global ERP system that is planned to be completed in phases. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects. The Company\u2019s ERP implementation requires substantial internal resources and involves expenditures for software and external consulting activities. During the conversion period, the Company may encounter difficulties that could disrupt our operations, including the ability to timely ship customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage the supply chain, and otherwise adequately service customers. If these difficulties were encountered, the implementation could require significantly more management time and higher implementation costs than currently estimated and our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf the subcontractors we rely on for component parts or products delay deliveries or fail to deliver parts or products meeting our requirements, we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion and our revenues and profits could be reduced.\nWe rely on subcontractors for certain components of our products, including outside subcontracting assembly houses to produce the circuit boards that we use in our products. As a result, we have limited control over the quality and the delivery schedules of components or products\npurchased from third parties. In addition, we purchase a number of component parts from single source suppliers. If our supplies of component parts or products meeting our requirements are significantly delayed or interrupted, or our subcontractors choose to terminate their supply contracts, we may not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion. This could result in a reduction in revenues and profits for these periods. The termination of or material change in the purchase terms of any single source supplier could have a similar impact on us. It is also possible, if our delay in delivering products to our customer is too long, the customer could cancel its order, resulting in a permanent loss of revenue and profit from that sale. Although we have not experienced significant supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years, from time to time, we have experienced significant delays in the receipt of certain components.\nFinally, although we believe that alternative suppliers are available, difficulties or delays may arise if we shift manufacturing capacity to new suppliers.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to disclose whether our products contain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (\u201cDRC\u201d), whether or not the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. In 2014, to meet the initial disclosure requirements, we began due diligence to determine the sources of the conflict minerals in our products. Because our supply chain is very complex, we may not be able to verify all the metals used in our products or the origin of all metals used in our products. The pricing, sourcing and availability of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products could be impacted by these new requirements. There are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of all conflict metals used in our products and confirm that they are DRC conflict mineral free, which may adversely affect our reputations with our customers and shareholders.\nOur failure to accurately forecast customer demand could result in excess or obsolete inventory and related write-downs or charges.\nFrom time to time, we may strategically enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for our products in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about long lead times for components used in our products that are purchased from third parties. Our failure to accurately forecast customer demand has led to, and may again in the future lead to, an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory. This could result in write-downs of inventory and other related charges that would negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of business system disruptions or information security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nTo our knowledge, we have not been subject to information security breaches; however, many other companies have experienced such breaches because of illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. While we have implemented security measures to protect against such breaches, it is possible that our security measures may not detect or prevent such breaches. Any such compromise to our information security could result in an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data, the violation of privacy or other laws, and the exposure to litigation, any of which could harm our business and operating results. A disruption to our management information systems could cause significant disruption to our business, including our ability to receive and ship orders, receive and process payments and timely report our financial results. Any disruption occurring with these systems may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Board of Directors has the right to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further action by shareholders. The issuance of those shares could cause the market price of our Common Stock to drop significantly and could be used to prevent or frustrate shareholders\u2019 attempts to replace or remove current management.\nAlthough no preferred stock currently is outstanding, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors, without further action by shareholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), the dividends payable thereon, liquidation payments, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights and redemption rights. In the event that preferred stock is issued, the rights of the common stockholders may be adversely affected. This could result in a reduction in the value of our Common Stock.\nThe preferred stock could be issued to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. This may be beneficial to our management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt.\nOur rights plan could be used to discourage hostile tender offers.\nWe maintain a rights plan. Under the plan, if any person acquires 20% or more of our outstanding Common Stock, our shareholders, other than the acquirer, will have the right to purchase shares of our Common Stock at half their market price. The rights plan discourages potential acquirers from initiating tender offers for our Common Stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. This may be beneficial to our management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 77868, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "PRCP"}
