{"cik": "708818", "company": "NEXTGEN HEALTHCARE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these known or unknown risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could in the future, adversely affect our business and the business of our customers and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic and continuing efforts to control its spread or the resurgence thereof has had a significant, ongoing impact on our operations (including in India) and the operations of our healthcare clients. For example, declines in patient volumes at the onset of the pandemic negatively impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, most notably for purchases of software and hardware. The impact of the disruption also impacted the first half of fiscal 2021, primarily in managed services and EDI, which are volume driven.\nWe may experience further negative financial impact due to a number of factors, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nSocial, economic, and labor instability in India which continues to experience a severe COVID-19 resurgence and where we have operations;\n\u2022\nA general decline in business activity including the impact of our clients\u2019 office closures;\n\u2022\nA disproportionate impact on the healthcare groups and other healthcare professionals with whom we contract;\n\u2022\nFinancial pressures on our clients, which may in turn result in their deferment of purchase decisions, or a delay in collections or non-payment;\n\u2022\nDeclines in new business bookings as our clients reduce or delay purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nExtensions of the length of sales and implementation cycles;\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our supply chains and our third-party vendors, partners, and suppliers; and\n\u2022\nThe potential negative impact on the health or productivity of employees, especially if a significant number of them are impacted.\nThe magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic, resurgences or additional \u201cwaves\u201d of outbreaks of the virus in various jurisdictions (including new strains or mutations of the virus), the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, the actions taken by health authorities and policy makers to contain its impacts on public health and the global economy, and the effectiveness of vaccines. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business because of the global or U.S. economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and may adversely impact our ability to access capital markets. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face significant, evolving competition which, if we fail to properly address, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and price of our stock. The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive and subject to evolving technology, solution standards and user needs. We face significant competition from various sources and several of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial, technical, product development and marketing resources than we do. Some of our larger competitors, who have greater scale than we do, have, and may continue to become more active in our markets both through internal development and acquisitions. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase because of government programs and consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures that we face will not materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Transaction induced and other competitive pressures and factors, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to develop and market new products to respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards and our clients may not accept our products or services. There can be no assurance that we will be successful\nin developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to user needs, changing market conditions or client requirements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, there can be no assurance that our applications will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other available software products. If we fail to distinguish our offerings from other options available to healthcare providers, the demand for and market share of our offerings may decrease. In response to increasing market demand, we are currently developing new generations of targeted software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these new software products or that these products will operate successfully, or that any such development, even if successful, will be completed concurrently with or prior to introduction of competing products. Any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nSaturation or consolidation in the healthcare industry could result in the loss of existing clients, a reduction in our potential client base and downward pressure on the prices for our products and services. As the healthcare information systems market continues to evolve, saturation of this market with our products or our competitors' products could limit our revenues and opportunities for growth. There has also been increasing consolidation amongst healthcare industry participants in recent years, creating integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, the number of market participants decreases, the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key industry participants increases, and competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense. Consolidation of management and billing services may lead integrated delivery systems to require newly acquired physician practices to replace their products with that already in use in the larger enterprise. Our inability to make initial sales of our systems to, or maintain relationships with, newly formed groups and/or healthcare providers that are replacing or substantially modifying their healthcare information systems, or, if we were forced to reduce our prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur relationships with strategic partners may fail to benefit us as expected. We face risk and/or the possibility of claims from activities related to strategic partners, which could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We rely on third parties to provide certain services for our business. These third parties could raise their prices and/or be acquired by our competitors, which could potentially create short and long-term disruptions to our business, negatively impacting our revenue, profit and/or stock price. We also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenue. Due to these third-party relationships, we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities, products, or services of these third-party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. In addition, our strategic partners may compete with us in some or all of the markets in which we operate. If we lose any of these third-party relationships or fail to establish additional relationships, or if our relationships fail to benefit us as expected, this could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are dependent on our license rights and other services from third parties, which may cause us to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments. We depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products as well as other services from third parties. Our remote hosting and cloud services businesses also rely on a limited number of software and services suppliers for certain functions of these businesses. Most of these arrangements can be continued/renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated for any number of reasons. We may not be able to continue using the products or services made available to us under these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product development or services provided until we can obtain equivalent technology or services. Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the business elements covered by these arrangements and use these elements to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue providing their technology or services in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products.\nWe have acquired companies, and may engage in future acquisitions, which may be expensive, time consuming, subject to inherent risks and from which we may not realize anticipated benefits. Historically, we have acquired numerous businesses, technologies, and products. We may acquire additional businesses, technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses, technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals. Acquisitions have inherent risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not limited to the following: (i) failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets; (ii) potentially dilutive issuances of our securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; (iii) using cash as acquisition currency may adversely affect interest or investment income, which may in turn adversely affect our earnings and /or earnings per share; (iv) unanticipated expenses or difficulty in fully or effectively integrating or retaining the acquired technologies, software products, services, business practices, management teams or personnel, which would prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the acquisition; (v) failure to maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures across acquired businesses; (vi) difficulty in predicting and\nresponding to issues related to product transition such as development, distribution and client support; (vii) the assumption of known and unknown liabilities; (viii) the possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality, product architecture, product development, intellectual property issues, regulatory risks, compliance risks, key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies, including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies; and (ix) the possibility that acquired assets become impaired, or that acquired assets lead us to determine that existing assets become impaired, requiring us to take a charge to earnings which could be significant. A failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology could, for any of these reasons, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel. If such personnel were to leave unexpectedly, we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key development, client service and senior management personnel and successful recruitment of new talent. These personnel have specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business and our industry. The industry in which we operate is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us. Loss of services of key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to grant additional equity incentives to key employees and provide other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel. Equity incentives may be dilutive to our per share financial performance. Failure to provide such types of incentive compensation could jeopardize our recruitment and retention capabilities.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, including in the new markets we may enter, our business and financial results could suffer. We have in the past experienced periods of growth which have placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our non-cash resources. We have also expanded our overall software development, marketing, sales, client management and implementation and training capacity, and may do so in the future. In the event we are unable to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals in such capacities within a reasonable timeframe, such failure could have an adverse effect on the operation of our business. In addition, our future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our business in new markets that we may enter. We are engaging in the strategic identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities in new markets or offerings, including but not limited to the areas of interoperability, patient engagements, data analytics and population health. We may also expand our global sales efforts. In addition, as clients move from fee-for-service to fee-for-value reimbursement strategies in conjunction with the adoption of population health business models, we may not make appropriate and timely changes to our service offerings consistent with shifts in market demands and expectations. In order to successfully execute on our growth initiatives, we will need to, among other things, manage changing business conditions, anticipate and react to changes in the regulatory environment, and develop expertise in areas outside of our business's traditional core competencies. Difficulties in managing future growth, including in new markets, could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in developing or launching our new software products and services, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We invest significant resources in the research and development of new and enhanced software products and services. Over the last few years, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant internal research and development expenses, a portion of which have been and may continue to be recorded as capitalized software costs. We cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to plan, develop, sell or implement new software products that meet client expectations, which could result in an impairment of the value of the related capitalized software costs, an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results and a negative impact the future of our business. Additionally, we cannot be assured that we will continue to capitalize software development costs to the same extent as we have done to date, as the result of changes in development methodologies and other factors. To the extent that we capitalize a lower percentage of total software development costs, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe have substantial development and other operations in India, and we use offshore third-party partners located in India and other countries, that subject us to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties and to laws applicable to U.S. companies operating overseas and other risks of global operations. We are subject to several risks associated with having a portion of our assets and operations located in India and by using third party service providers in India and other countries. Many U.S. companies have benefited from many policies of the Government of India and the Indian state governments in the states in which we operate, which are designed to promote foreign investment generally and the business process services industry in particular, including significant tax incentives, relaxation of regulatory restrictions, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. There is no assurance that such policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current Government of India, could trigger significant changes in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. In addition, our financial performance and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In particular, India has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years, but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education. Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, develop and operate our captive facility could be adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these challenges. In addition, U.S. governing authorities may pressure us to perform work domestically rather than using\noffshore resources. Furthermore, local laws and customs in India may differ from those in the U.S. For example, it may be a local custom for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies from giving or offering money, gifts, or anything of value to a foreign official to obtain or retain business and requires businesses to make and keep accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. We cannot guarantee that our employees, contractors, and agents will comply with all of our FCPA compliance policies and procedures. If we or our employees, contractors, or agents fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation and investigations, which may adversely impact our marketing, distract management and have a negative impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face the risks associated with litigation and investigations concerning the operation of our business, including claims by clients regarding product and contract disputes, by other third parties asserting infringement of intellectual property rights, by current and former employees regarding certain employment matters, by certain shareholders, and by governmental and regulatory bodies for failures to comply with applicable laws. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved disputes may have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, such disputes could impair our relationships with existing clients and our ability to obtain new clients. Defending litigation and investigative matters may require substantial cost and may result in a diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCommencing in April 2017, we have received requests for documents and information from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont and other government agencies in connection with an investigation concerning the certification we obtained for our software under the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program. The requests for information relate to, among other things: (a) data used to determine objectives and measures under the Meaningful Use (MU) and the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) programs, (b) our EHR product and its performance, including defects that relate to patient safety or meaningful use certifications, (c) the software code used in certifying our EHR software and information, and (d) marketing programs and payments provided for the referral of EHR business. We continue to respond to the government\u2019s request. Requests and investigations of this nature may lead to future requests for information and ultimately the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us, which themselves may lead to material fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, our responses to these and any future requests require time and effort, which can result in additional cost to us. At this time, we are unable to estimate the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. However, the unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nRequests and investigations of this nature may lead to future requests for information and ultimately the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us, which themselves may lead to material fines, penalties or other material liabilities. In addition, our responses to these and any future requests require time and effort, which can result in additional cost to us. Given the highly-regulated nature of our industry, we may, from time to time, be subject to subpoenas, requests for information, or investigations from various government agencies. It is our practice to respond to such matters in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. There can be no assurance that such litigation and investigations will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, any enforcement action by a government agency may result in fines, damage awards, regulatory consequences or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect, individually or collectively, on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face risks related to litigation advanced by a former director and shareholder of ours. On October 7, 2013, a complaint was filed against our Company and certain of our officers and directors in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Orange, captioned Ahmed D. Hussein v. Sheldon Razin, Steven Plochocki, Quality Systems, Inc. and Does 1-10, inclusive, No. 30-2013-00679600-CU-NP-CJC, by Ahmed Hussein, a former director and significant shareholder of our Company. The amended complaint generally alleges fraud and deceit, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with statements made to our shareholders regarding our financial condition and projected future performance. The amended complaint seeks actual damages, exemplary and punitive damages and costs. Trial commenced on July 6, 2021. On July 29, 2021, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Company and Messrs. Razin and Plochocki on all counts. See Note 22, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information. The plaintiff could appeal the verdict. Although we believe the claim to be without merit, the unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Operations, Products and Services\nWe could fail to maintain and expand our business with our existing clients or effectively transition our clients to newer products. We believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our systems has been our ability to meet the needs of users of healthcare information systems. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients through the timely development and successful introduction of new and enhanced versions of our systems and other complementary products, as well as our ability to provide high quality implementation, training and support services for our products. We have historically expended a significant percentage of our net revenue on product development and believe that significant continuing product development efforts will be required to retain our existing clients and sustain our growth. Continued investment in our sales staff and our client implementation, training and support staffs will also be required to retain and grow our client base. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our client satisfaction or product development efforts, that the market will continue to accept our existing products and services, or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner, meet the requirements of healthcare providers, or achieve market acceptance.\nWe may be subject to claims for system errors and warranties or incur substantial costs related to product and service-related liabilities. Our products and services, or the third-party software products or services incorporated therein, may contain defects or errors, including errors in the design, coding, implementation or configuration, which could create vulnerabilities and affect the ability of our products and services to properly function, integrate or operate with other offerings, or achieve market acceptance. If we detect errors before we introduce new products or services or enhancements to existing products or services, we may have to delay deployment for an extended period while we address the problem. If we do not discover errors until after product deployment, we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors. Remediating product defects and errors could consume our development and management resources. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to maintain high-quality and highly-responsive client support could harm our reputation. Quality or performance issues with our products and services may result in product-related liabilities, unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors, harm to our reputation, lost sales, delays in commercial releases, delays in or loss of market acceptance of our solutions, license termination or renegotiations, and privacy or security vulnerabilities. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our reputation as well as our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, our clients may use our products or services together with products or services from other companies or those that they have developed internally. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.\nWe may be liable for use of content we provide. We provide content for use by healthcare providers in treating patients. Certain of the content is provided by third-party content suppliers. In addition, certain of our solutions provide applications that relate to patient clinical information. If this content is incorrect or incomplete, adverse consequences may occur and give rise to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our website by us or third parties, including content providers or users. We could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our website or third-party websites linked from our website or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms, bulletin boards or on websites created by professionals using our applications. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims for system errors, warranties, or product liability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software solutions and services are very complex and may contain design, coding or other errors which could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other offerings, create vulnerabilities, and adversely affect market acceptance. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own solutions and services. Our software solutions are intended for use in collecting, storing and displaying clinical and healthcare-related information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients and in related healthcare settings such as admissions and billing. Therefore, users of our software solutions have a greater sensitivity to errors than the market for software products generally. Any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information concerning patients, their medication, treatment and health status, generally, could result in claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance, industry reputation and ability to market new system sales. In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed practitioners, or delivery of information by a third-party site that a consumer accesses through our websites, exposes us to assertions of malpractice, other personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery/handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end-user agreements, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us. A successful claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources.\nCertain healthcare professionals who use our SaaS products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, the common law and contractual obligations, govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information, including: (i) state and federal privacy and confidentiality laws; (ii) our contracts with clients and partners; (iii) state laws regulating healthcare professionals; (iv) Medicaid laws; (v) HIPAA and related rules proposed by CMS; (vi) CMS standards for internet transmission of health data and (vii); and The 21st Century Cures Act.\nHIPAA establishes elements including, but not limited to, federal privacy and security standards for the use and protection of Protected Health Information. Any failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us.\nWe face risks related to the periodic maintenance and upgrades that need to be made to our products. As we continue to develop and improve upon our technology and offerings, we need to periodically upgrade and maintain the products deployed to our clients. This process can require a significant amount of our internal time and resources and can be complicated and time consuming for our clients. Certain upgrades may also pose the risk of system delays or failure. If our periodic upgrades and maintenance cause disruptions to our clients, we may lose revenue-generating transactions, our clients may elect to use other solutions and we may also be the subject of negative publicity that may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct which we cannot control and accordingly, there is no assurance that revenue for our services will continue at historic levels. We offer certain electronic claims submission products and services as part of our product line. In addition, we offer revenue cycle management services that includes manual and electronic processing and submission of medical claims by physicians to patients\u2019 payers for approval and reimbursement. While we have implemented policies, procedures and certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete, these policies, procedures and features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers by our system or through our services. Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may be subject to liability claims.\nElectronic data transmission services are offered by certain payers to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payer. This process reduces revenue to third party electronic data interchange (\u201cEDI\u201d) service providers such as us. As a result of this, and other market factors, we are unable to ensure that we will continue to generate revenue at or in excess of prior levels for such services. A significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could adversely affect our transaction volume and financial results. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payers or develop new connections on terms that are economically satisfactory to us, if at all.\nWe may experience interruption at our data centers or client support facilities. We perform data center and/or hosting services for certain clients, including the storage of critical patient and administrative data at company-owned facilities and through third party hosting arrangements. In addition, we provide support services to our clients through various client support facilities. We have invested in reliability features such as multiple power feeds, multiple backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines, as well as technical (such as multiple overlapping security applications, access control and other countermeasures) and physical security safeguards and structured our operations to reduce the likelihood of disruptions. However, complete failure of all local public power and backup generators, impairment of all telecommunications lines, a concerted denial of service cyber-attack, a significant data breach, damage, injury or impairment (environmental, accidental, intentional or pandemic) to the buildings, the equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers, the personnel operating such facilities or the client data contained therein, or errors by the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact clients who depend on us for data center and system support services. Likewise, our use of a single cloud vendor could increase our exposure to interruptions if the vendor were to experience a catastrophic event impacting its service offering. Any interruption in operations at our data centers and/or client support facilities could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients, hurt our ability to obtain new clients, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities for our clients and us and increase insurance and other operating costs.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a client\u2019s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, clients may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities. Our services involve the storage, transmission and processing of clients\u2019 proprietary information and protected health information of patients. Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences. We rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data. On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities. Failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation even though our policy is to enter into business associate agreements with our clients. Although we train and monitor our employees, it is possible\nthat our employees may, intentionally or unintentionally, breach security measures. Moreover, third parties with whom we do not have business associate agreements may breach the privacy and security of patient information, potentially causing us reputational damage and exposing us to liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients. In addition, our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.\nViolations of state or federal privacy laws may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business. Certain health privacy laws, data breach notification laws and consumer protection laws may apply directly to our business and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our collection, use and dissemination of individuals\u2019 health information. Patients about whom we obtain health information, as well as the healthcare services clients who share this information with us, may have statutory or contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, violated applicable privacy laws and regulations or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. This could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that are beneficial to our business. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches. In the course of our business operations, we store, process, compile and transmit confidential information, including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive information. We also use third-party contractors to provide certain of these services, such as the service provides that host our technology platform. Although we train and monitor our employees and have systems in place that we believe are reasonably designed to prevent and detect security breaches, we have no guarantee that these programs and controls will be adequate to prevent all possible security threats. it is possible that our own employees, or that of our clients and vendors, may engage in conduct that compromises security or privacy. Unauthorized access to our computer systems or data, or to the computer systems or data of our contractors, could result in the misappropriation or loss of assets or the disclosure of sensitive information, the corruption of data, disruption of our business operations, damage our reputation, reduce demand for our services, require us to devote financial and other resources to mitigate these breaches, subject us to litigation from our clients or shareholders, as well as actions by regulatory agencies, and result in damages being assessed against us. In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, malware, programming errors, or similar disruptive problems. The effect of these security breaches and related issues could also disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services. Accordingly, we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures, although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach. Maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future.\nThe success of our strategy to offer our EDI services and SaaS solutions depends on the confidence of our clients in our ability to securely transmit confidential information. Our EDI services and SaaS solutions rely on encryption, authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. We may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our clients. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our, or our clients\u2019, operations. In addition, our EDI and SaaS solutions may be vulnerable to viruses, malware, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nHigh-profile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attacks targeting information technology products and businesses. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects other software and hardware companies, we may be targeted by computer hackers because we are a prominent healthcare information technology company and have high profile clients. These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings, store and process increasingly large amounts of our clients\u2019 confidential data, including personal health information, and host or manage parts of our clients\u2019 businesses in cloud-based/multi-tenant information technology environments. We use third party cloud providers in connection with our cloud-based offerings or third-party providers to host our own data, in which case we may have to rely on the processes, controls and security such third parties have in place to protect the infrastructure. Moreover, unauthorized access, use or disclosure of such sensitive information, including any resulting from the incidents described above, could result in civil or criminal liability or regulatory action, including potential fines and penalties. The costs we would incur to address any security incidents would increase our expenses, and our efforts to resolve these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential clients that may impede our sales, development of solutions, provision of services, or other critical functions. If a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our clients\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 data, our own data, or our information technology systems, or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. This could lead to fewer clients using our products or services and make it more difficult for us to obtain new clients, resulting in reduced revenue and earnings. These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and claims, and increased legal liability.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and we rely on bandwidth providers, data center providers, and other third parties over which we exercise limited control. We deliver products and services that are dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. Any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems, or any failure of or by third-party providers\u2019 systems or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use, could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over our third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing services, which could result in substantial costs to remedy those problems or negatively impact our relationship with our clients, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThere is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate, and the current governmental laws and regulations as well as any future modifications to the regulatory environment, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic, legal, and regulatory influences that may affect our business, the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities and our costs to deliver products and services that enable our clients to meet their compliance requirements. As a participant in the healthcare industry, our business, and that of our clients, is subject to a wide array of complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws, regulations, and industry initiatives, including in the areas of information sharing, electronic health record and interoperability standards, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, security and privacy of patient data, and healthcare fraud, including laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims which apply to healthcare providers and others that make, offer, seek or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and, in some instances, any private program. These laws are complex and their application to our specific services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have recently increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other healthcare reimbursement laws and rules.\nDuring the past several years, the healthcare industry has also been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of, among other things, reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures.\nHIPAA continues to have a direct impact on the health care industry by requiring national provider identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets, operating rules and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the appropriate level of privacy of protected health information. These regulatory factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of health care organizations.\nThe PPACA included provisions to control health care costs, improve health care quality, and expand access to affordable health insurance. MACRA, which became law in 2015, repealed the sustainable growth rate formula and created two new value-based payment systems for Medicare physicians. Together with ongoing statutory and budgetary policy developments at a federal level, these health care reform laws include changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment policies and other health care delivery administrative reforms that could potentially negatively impact our business and the business of our clients. Because of a factitious legislative environment at the federal level, and because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health programs, the full impact of the health care reform legislation and of further statutory actions to reform healthcare payment on our business is unknown, and there can be no assurances that health care reform legislation will not adversely impact either our operational results or the way we operate our business. Healthcare industry\nparticipants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.\nRegulations around electronic prescribing impose certain requirements which can be burdensome and evolve regularly and may adversely affect our business model.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed several laws in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Included in these laws are a series of rules and orders to offer healthcare providers flexibility or waivers from certain regulatory requirements during the PHE that are still in effect today. For example, changes were made through waivers and other regulatory authority to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond the PHE period.\nHealthcare providers may react to these laws and any future proposals, and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals, by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products and services. Cost-containment measures instituted by healthcare providers because of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds. Such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our solutions and services. On the other hand, changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost-effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs existing regulations mature and become better defined, we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services, but we cannot fully predict the effect at this time. We have taken steps to modify our products, services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with the regulations, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner. Achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management\u2019s attention and divert other company resources, and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nHealth Reform. The health reform laws discussed above and that may be enacted in the future contain and may contain various provisions which may impact us and our clients. Some of these provisions may have a positive impact, by expanding the use of electronic health records and other health information technology solutions in certain federal programs, for example, while others, such as reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers, may have a negative impact due to fewer available resources. Increases in fraud and abuse penalties may also adversely affect participants in the health care sector, including us.\nDevelopments of additional federal and state regulations and policies have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business.\nOther specific risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to:\nPrivacy and Security of Patient Information. As part of the operation of our business, we and our third-party service providers collect, process and store significant amounts of sensitive, confidential and proprietary information, including personally identifiable information, such as payment data and protected health information. U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign legislation govern the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security and privacy measures.\nHIPAA regulations apply national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions to ensure the integrity, security and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information and require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients and vendors. Failure by us to enter into adequate business associate agreements with any client or vendor would place us in violation of applicable standards and requirements and could expose us to liability. We and our clients are also subject to evolving state laws regarding the privacy and security of healthcare information and personal information generally. These rules, and any future changes to privacy and security rules, may increase the cost of compliance and could subject us to additional enforcement actions, which could further increase our costs and adversely affect the way in which we do business.\nData protection regulations impact how businesses, including both us and our clients, can collect and process the personal data of individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies, or modifications thereto, that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we incur development, resource, and capital costs in delivering, updating, and supporting products and services to enable our clients to comply with these varying and evolving standards. U.S. federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental enforcement personnel have substantial powers and remedies, particularly in the EU, to pursue suspected or perceived violations. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil penalties, sanctions and contract liability and could otherwise damage our reputation. Enforcement investigations, even if meritless, could have a negative impact on our reputation, cause us to lose existing clients or limit our ability to attract new clients.\nInteroperability and Other Regulatory Standards. Our clients are concerned with and often require that our software solutions and health care devices be interoperable with other third-party health care information technology suppliers. With the passing of the MACRA in 2015, the U.S. Congress declared it a national objective to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified EHR technology nationwide by December 31, 2018. The Cures Act includes numerous provisions intended to encourage this nationwide interoperability. In March 2020, the ONC finalized additional regulations under the Cures Act to enforce the Act\u2019s policy directives relating to data sharing and interoperability. Specifically, it calls on developers of certified EHRs and health IT products to adopt standardized application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d), which will help allow individuals to securely and easily access structured and unstructured EHI formats using smartphones and other mobile devices. This provision and others included in the rule create a lengthy list of new certification and maintenance of certification requirements that developers of EHRs and other health IT products must meet in order to maintain approved federal government certification status. Meeting and maintaining this certification status will require additional development costs.\nThe ONC rule also implements the information blocking provisions of the Cures Act, including identifying reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. Under the Cures Act, the HHS has the regulatory authority to investigate and assess civil monetary penalties of up to $1,000,000 against certified health IT developers found to be in violation of \u201cinformation blocking\u201d prohibitions. This new oversight and authority to investigate claims of information blocking creates significant risks for us and our clients and could potentially create substantial new compliance costs.\nOther regulatory provisions included in the Cures Act could create compliance costs and/or regulatory risks for the company. Because these regulations are subject to future changes and/or significant enforcement discretion by federal agencies, the ultimate impact of these regulations is unknown. Market forces or governmental authorities could continue to create software interoperability or other regulatory standards that could apply to our solutions, and if our applicable products or services are not consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs. If our applicable products or services are not consistent with these varying and evolving standards or do not support our clients in their efforts to meet new certification requirements, our market position and sales could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nFederal Requirements for the Use of Interoperable and Certified Health Information Technology. Various federal and state laws governing the use and content of EHRs may affect the design of such technology. As such, our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients\u2019 compliance with these laws. In 2009, the United States federal government enacted the HITECH Act, which authorized the ONC to establish the functionality that EHR products must meet for our technologies to be considered certified. Although the incentive programs available to healthcare providers who implemented EHRs and demonstrated meaningful use has since expired, the requirements associated with certification and privacy remain in effect. In the last several years, participation in Medicare's \"alternative payment models\" to replace traditional \"fee for service\" payments with quality and risk-sharing payment models has been conditioned on the adoption of certified electronic health record technology (\u201cCEHRT\u201d). The Cures Act has tied CEHRT to certain of its policy goals, and participation in Medicare\u2019s alternative payment models has also been conditioned on the adoption of CEHRT. Along with recent CMS actions taken for Medicare and Medicaid, these regulations will also mandate adoption of updated and expanded certified capabilities of CEHRT that our clients must adopt to remain able to participate in the federal programs mentioned earlier. In addition, the ONC has increased its surveillance activities concerning vendor compliance relative to CEHRT.\nWhere clients have relied on our software as being certified according to applicable HITECH Act technical standards, we may face liability related to any incentive that the physicians received in reliance upon such certification if this certification were to be challenged. Failure to maintain this certification under the HITECH Act could also jeopardize our relationships with customers who are relying upon us to provide certified software and will make our products and services less attractive to customers than the offerings of other EHR vendors who maintain certification of their products. If our clients do not receive or lose expected payments from other incentive pay for value programs this could harm or delay their willingness to purchase future products or upgrades. We also cannot predict the speed at which healthcare providers will participate in the relevant programs or whether healthcare providers will select our products and services at all.\nIt is also possible that additional regulations or government programs related to electronic health records, amendment or repeal of current healthcare laws and regulations or the delay in regulatory implementation could require us to undertake additional efforts to meet expanded CEHRT standards, materially impact our ability to compete in the evolving healthcare IT market, materially impact healthcare providers' decisions to implement electronic health records systems or have other impacts that would be unfavorable to our business. The costs of achieving and maintaining CEHRT are also significant and because the definition of CEHRT and its use requirements for clients are subject to regulatory changes. We cannot predict the content or effect of possible changes to these laws or new federal and state laws that might govern these systems and services. Our inability to design our systems and services in a manner that facilitates our clients\u2019 compliance with these laws could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to false or fraudulent claim laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any failure of our revenue cycle management services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including, but not limited to, criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Errors by us or our systems with\nrespect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers and have an adverse effect on our business. Determination by a court that we have violated the FCA may subject us to treble damages, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation. It is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our revenue cycle management services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services. To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims. CMS has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.\nA portion of our business involves billing of Medicare claims on behalf of its clients. In an effort to combat fraudulent Medicare claims, the federal government offers rewards for reporting of Medicare fraud which could encourage others to subject us to a charge of fraudulent claims, including charges that are ultimately proven to be without merit.\nAdditionally, under the FCA, the federal government allows private individuals to file a complaint or otherwise report actions alleging the defrauding of the federal government by an entity. These suits, known as qui tam actions or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits may be brought by, with only a few exceptions, any private citizen who believes that he has material information of a false claim that has not been previously disclosed. If the federal government intervenes, the individual that filed the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the federal government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue its allegation independently. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Qui tam actions under the FCA and similar state laws may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from Medicare or other federal or state healthcare programs, which could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations\nWe are susceptible to evolving government and industry standards and regulations. United States healthcare system reform at both the federal and state level could increase government involvement in healthcare, reconfigure reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, financial condition or operating results. Our clients and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products and services.\nWe may experience reduced revenues and/or be forced to reduce our prices in response to changes to the healthcare regulatory landscape. We may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales arising from various sources, including among other things, government action affecting reimbursement levels. Our clients and the other entities with which we have business relationships are affected by changes in statutes, regulations, and limitations on government spending for Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. Recent government actions and future legislative and administrative changes could limit government spending for Medicare and Medicaid programs, limit payments to healthcare providers, increase emphasis on competition, impose price controls, initiate new and expanded value-based reimbursement programs and create other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our business. If we experience significant downward pricing pressure, our revenues may decline along with our ability to absorb overhead costs, which may leave our business less profitable.\nFDA Regulation of Software as a Medical Device. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) may in the future determine that our technology solutions are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The December 2016 Cures Act clarified the definition of a medical device to exclude certain health information technology such as EHRs; however, the legislation did leave the opportunity for that designation to be revisited if determined to be necessary by changing industry and technological dynamics. As a result, our software may potentially be subject to regulation by the FDA as a medical device. Such regulation could require the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products, application of detailed record-keeping and manufacturing standards, application of the medical device excise tax, and FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. An approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing, and the FDA could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications, the result of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital and Credit Risks\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. If we fail to meet our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. On March 12, 2021, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various lenders, secured by substantially all of our and our material domestic subsidiaries\u2019 existing and future property. The credit agreement and potential subsequent amendments may include certain customary covenants that impose restrictions on our business and financing activities that could limit our operations or flexibility to take certain actions. The credit agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants requiring us to maintain specified levels of financial performance. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events that could be beyond our control. A breach of these covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable, which in turn could result in material adverse consequences that negatively impact our business, the market price for our common stock, and our ability to obtain financing in the future. In addition, our credit agreement\u2019s covenants, consent requirements, and other provisions may limit our flexibility to pursue or fund strategic initiatives or acquisitions that might be in the long-term interests of our Company and shareholders.\nUncertainty in global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, operating results or financial condition. Global economic and political uncertainty have caused in the past, and may cause in the future, unfavorable business conditions such as a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. Instability can make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause constrained spending on our products and services, delays and a lengthening of our sales cycles and/or difficulty in collection of our accounts receivable. Current or potential clients may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. Our clients may cease business operations or conduct business on a greatly reduced basis. Bankruptcies or similar insolvency events affecting our clients may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically anticipated. Further, economic instability could limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing business conditions or new opportunities. Finally, our investment portfolio is generally subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by these and global financial conditions and other geopolitical factors, including as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and continuing uncertainty surrounding the effects of Covid-19. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected as well. In addition, our compliance with complex foreign and United States laws and regulations that apply to our global operations and sales efforts increases our cost of doing business.\nTax, Finance and Accounting Related Risks\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, one or more of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue, results of operations, and debt covenant compliance. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Commission, we believe our current business arrangements, transactions, and related estimates and disclosures have been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. In addition, changes in accounting rules could alter the application of certain terms in our credit agreement, thereby impacting our ability to comply with our debt covenants.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business, and our per share price may be adversely affected. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, we are required to include in our Form 10-K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management.\nAs part of the evaluation undertaken by management and our independent registered public accountants pursuant to Section 404, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of our most recent fiscal year end. However, if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses that we would then be required to disclose. Any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results, and we might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nNo evaluation process can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect and correct all failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, if we continue to expand, through either organic growth or through acquisitions (or both), the challenges involved in implementing appropriate controls will increase and may require that we evolve some or all of our internal control processes.\nIt is also possible that the overall scope of Section 404 may be revised in the future, thereby causing ourselves to review, revise or reevaluate our internal control processes which may result in the expenditure of additional human and financial resources.\nOur software products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly, we have historically operated with a minimal backlog of license fees. As a result, a portion of our revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and is not predictable with any degree of certainty. Furthermore, our systems can be relatively large and expensive, and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such sale can adversely affect our quarterly revenue and profitability. Clients often defer systems purchases until our quarter end, so quarterly revenue from system sales generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until after the quarter has concluded. Our sales are dependent upon clients\u2019 initial decisions to replace or substantially modify their existing information systems, and subsequently, their decision concerning which products and services to purchase. These are major decisions for healthcare providers and, accordingly, the sales cycle for our systems can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution/shipment. Because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, a variation in the timing of systems sales, implementations and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period. We currently recognize revenue in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance as defined by the FASB. There can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of these pronouncements will not further modify our revenue recognition policies, or that such modifications would not adversely affect our operating results reported in any particular quarter or year. Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe unpredictability of our quarterly operating results may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline. Our revenue may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period, as a result of a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of orders from clients;\n\u2022\nthe specific mix of software, hardware and services in client orders;\n\u2022\nthe length of sales cycles and installation processes;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our clients to obtain financing for the purchase of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") or other rule-making bodies;\n\u2022\nchanges in government healthcare policies and regulations, such as the shift from fee-for-service reimbursement to value-based reimbursement;\n\u2022\naccounting policies concerning the timing of the recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of system components;\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of clients;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new products, applications and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nour success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\ndeferrals of client orders in anticipation of new products, applications, product enhancements, or public/private sector initiatives;\n\u2022\nexecution of or changes to our strategy;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market/economic factors.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us. Volatility may be caused by several factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nrumors about our performance, software solutions, or merger and acquisition activity;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulatory action;\n\u2022\nhealth care reform measures;\n\u2022\nclient relationship developments;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of company stock;\n\u2022\nactivities by one or more of our major shareholders concerning our policies and operations;\n\u2022\nchanges occurring in the markets in general;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and internationally; and\n\u2022\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, healthcare and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nMoreover, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur intellectual property rights may be infringed or misappropriated by others and our proprietary technology may be subject to claims for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights of others. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality practices and policies, contractual terms and technical security measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of our proprietary information. We also rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to adequately protect against theft, copying, reverse engineering, misappropriation, infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, we are occasionally involved in intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims. These claims, even if unmeritorious, are expensive to defend and are often incapable of prompt resolution. If we are unsuccessful in defending these claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, develop alternative technology, obtain a license or cease using, selling, offering for sale, licensing, implementing, or supporting the applicable technology. In addition, claims may be brought against third parties from which we purchase software, and such claims could adversely affect our ability to access third party software for our systems. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the United States.", "PERMNO": 64961, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NXGN"}
