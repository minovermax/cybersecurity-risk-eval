{"cik": "1080056", "company": "THESTREET, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Report, before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of any of these risks, and you could lose part or all of your investment in our Common Stock. When deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock, you should also refer to the other information in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Report entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Please also refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate and our future revenue is difficult to forecast.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 the level of interest and investment in individual stocks versus index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) by both individual and institutional investors, which can impact our ability to sell premium subscription products and to sell advertising;\n\u00b7 the overall willingness of potential and existing customers to pay for content distributed over the Internet, where a large quantity of content is available for free;\n\u00b7 demand and pricing for advertising on our Websites, which is affected by advertising budget cycles of our customers, general economic conditions, demand for advertising on the Internet generally, the supply of advertising inventory in the market and actions by our competitors;\n\u00b7 subscription price reductions attributable to decreased demand or increased competition;\n\u00b7 the value to potential and existing customers of the investing ideas we offer in our subscription services and the performance of those ideas relative to appropriate benchmarks;\n\u00b7 new products or services introduced by our competitors;\n\u00b7 content production, specifically video, traffic acquisition costs, and/or other costs;\n\u00b7 for our business-to-business products such as The Deal, BoardEx and Private Raise, the volatility in mergers and acquisitions, restructuring and financing activities;\n\u00b7 for RateWatch, the volatility of interest rates and bank fees and the underlying demand for banking products by consumers;\n\u00b7 costs or lost revenue associated with system downtime affecting the Internet generally or our Websites in particular;\n\u00b7 general economic and financial market conditions; and\n\u00b7 our ability to attract and retain editorial and managerial talent.\nWe had a net loss in each of our last three fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, and have incurred net losses for most years of our history. We may not generate net income in future periods. We forecast our current and future expense levels based on expected revenue and our operating plans, and expect to increase our investments in our business this year with significant strategic investments in technology, marketing and content. These investments are intended to improve our products offered to both consumers and businesses but may not have the desired effect or impact. Because of the above factors, as well as other material risks we face, as described elsewhere in this Report, our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters. In such an event, the price of our Common Stock is likely to decline.\nKey content contributors, particularly James J. Cramer, are important to our current retail investor product offerings.\nSome of our products, particularly our editorial subscription products, reflect the talents, efforts, personalities, investing skills and portfolio returns, and reputations of their respective writers. As a result, the services of these key content contributors, including our co-founder James J. Cramer, form an essential element of our subscription revenue.\nIn November 2013, we entered into a new four-year employment agreement with Mr. Cramer, our founder and chief markets commentator, which will expire on December 31, 2017, unless renewed. This employment agreement provides for higher payments than the previous one, including a payment of royalties tied to products associated with Mr. Cramer, and includes a minimum guarantee of $2.5 million per year, a licensing fee of $300,000 per year, as well as reimbursement for certain expenses annually. In addition to his content contributions, we benefit from Mr. Cramer\u2019s popularity and visibility, which have provided public awareness of our services and introduced our content to new audiences. For example, Mr. Cramer hosts CNBC\u2019s finance television show, Mad Money. If, however, Mr. Cramer no longer appeared on the show or the program was cancelled for any reason, it could negatively impact his public profile and visibility, and in turn, our subscription products. Further, the continued value of Mr. Cramer\u2019s contributions could be materially adversely affected if Mr. Cramer were to otherwise lose popularity with the public. While we believe we greatly benefit from Mr. Cramer\u2019s contributions and his media exposure for other companies, we can give no assurance that our relationship with Mr. Cramer will lead to higher revenues from our subscription products or improve our organic growth.\nIn addition to Mr. Cramer, we seek to compensate and provide incentives for key content contributors through competitive salaries, stock ownership and bonus plans and/or royalty arrangements, and we have entered into employment or contributor agreements with certain of them. If we are unable to retain key content contributors, or, should we lose the services of one or more of our key content contributors to death, disability, loss of reputation or other reason, or should their popularity diminish or their investing returns and investing ideas fail to meet or exceed benchmarks and investor expectations, we may fail to attract new content contributors acceptable to readers of our collection of Websites and editorial subscription products. Thus, the loss of services of one or more of our key content contributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently experienced several changes in our management team and will need to recruit, hire and retain additional executive talent which may cause disruption in our business.\nWe have recently had significant changes in executive leadership. In February 2016, Elisabeth DeMarse resigned as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with Ms. DeMarse\u2019s resignation, Lawrence S. Kramer, the Chairman of our Board of Directors who had recently joined the Board in October 2015 and was named Chairman in December 2015, was appointed as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer in February 2016. We are currently conducting a search for a full-time replacement. Additionally, in January 2016, Eric Lundberg joined the Company as Chief Financial Officer, filling the role vacated by John C. Ferrara in October 2015. Other recent departures at the end of 2015 include our Chief Business Officer, Erwin Eichmann, and our General Counsel, Vanessa J. Soman.\nThese changes and the short time interval in which they have occurred have been disruptive to our employees and may add to the risk of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Additionally, it may take time to hire new executives and for the new management team to become sufficiently familiar with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. Accordingly, disruption to our organization as a result of executive management transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to company strategy, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult and tension can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result. In addition, uncertainty regarding the timing or effectiveness of our management transition process may also harm our reputation and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining capable management and operating personnel.\nOur ability to compete in the marketplace depends upon our ability to recruit and retain other key employees, including executives to operate our business, technology personnel to run our publishing, commerce, communications, video and other systems, direct marketers to sell subscriptions to our premium services and salespersons to sell our advertising inventory and subscriptions.\nSeveral, but not all, of our key employees are bound by agreements containing non-competition provisions. There can be no assurances that these arrangements with key employees will provide adequate protections to us or will not result in further management changes that would have material adverse impact on us. In addition, we may incur increased costs to continue to compensate our key executives, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries, stock ownership and bonus plans. Nevertheless, we can make no assurances that these programs will allow us to retain our management or key employees or hire new employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, or our inability to attract experienced and qualified replacements, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe terms of our Series B Preferred Stock include a substantial liquidation preference, as well as significant control rights.\nTCV VI, L.P. and TCV Member Fund, L.P., (together \u201cTCV\u201d) hold all of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d), which were originally issued in a November 2007 private placement. These shares are convertible into an aggregate of 3,856,942 shares of our Common Stock, at a conversion price of $14.26 per share, or approximately 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. However, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to a $55 million liquidation preference upon liquidation or dissolution of the Company or upon any change of control event. Accordingly, unless otherwise agreed to by TCV, the liquidation preference entitles the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock to a substantial premium in the event of a sale of the Company, which not only makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, but also may result in the holders of our Common Stock receiving significantly less than their pro rata share of the proceeds in the event we are acquired.\nThe holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the right to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company and are entitled to vote that number of votes equal to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such holders\u2019 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, TCV has the right to appoint one person to our board of directors, although they are not currently exercising this right.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of Series B Preferred Stock is necessary for the Company to take any of the following actions: (i) authorize, create or issue any class or classes of our capital stock ranking senior to, or on a parity with (as to dividends or upon a liquidation event) the Series B Preferred Stock or any securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, any now or hereafter authorized capital stock ranking senior to, or on a parity with (as to dividends or upon a liquidation event) the Series B Preferred Stock; (ii) approve any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock; (iii) approve any amendment, waiver, alteration or repeal of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws in a way that adversely affects the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series B Preferred Stock; (iv) authorize the payment of any dividends (other than dividends paid in capital stock of us or any of our subsidiaries) in excess of $0.10 per share per annum of our Common Stock unless after the payment of such dividends we have unrestricted cash (net of all indebtedness for borrowed money, purchase money obligations, promissory notes or bonds) in an amount equal to at least two times the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at the time such dividend is paid by the liquidation preference; and (v) authorize the purchase or redemption of: (A) any Common Stock (except for the purchase or redemption from employees, directors and consultants pursuant to agreements providing us with repurchase rights upon termination of their service with us) unless after such purchase or redemption we have unrestricted cash (net of all indebtedness for borrowed money, purchase money obligations, promissory notes or bonds) equal to at least two times the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at the time such dividend is paid by the liquidation preference; or (B) any class or series of now or hereafter authorized capital stock of ours that ranks junior to (upon a liquidation event) the Series B Preferred Stock.\nAs a result of the foregoing, TCV may be able to block the proposed approval of any of the above actions, which blockage may prevent us from achieving strategic or other goals dependent on such actions, including without limitation additional capital raising, certain dividend increases and the repurchase of outstanding Common Stock. All of the foregoing rights may limit our ability to take certain actions deemed in the interests of all of our stockholders but as to which the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have control rights.\nWe expect to make significant investments in our business in 2016 to increase organic growth, which will reduce our cash and require time to translate to revenue.\nFollowing several years of cost-cutting measures, we intend to make significant investments in our business this year, including launching new versions of our products and unveiling a newly expanded news operation intended to serve all of our businesses. We also intend to make additional strategic investments in technology, marketing and content. These investments may not be successful and will reduce our available cash to spend on other initiatives such as acquisitions of complementary products and services or distributions to our stockholders. In addition, these investments will take some time to translate into increased revenues or may never translate into revenue growth.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining or increasing our advertising revenue, a significant portion of which is concentrated among our top advertisers and subject to industry and other factors.\nAlthough our reliance on advertising has decreased as an overall component of our revenues, it remains important to our growth. Our ability to maintain or increase our advertising revenue may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include general market conditions, seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage, our ability to maintain or increase our unique visitors, page view inventory and user engagement, our ability to attract audiences possessing demographic characteristics most desired by our advertisers, and our ability to retain existing advertisers and win new advertisers in a number of advertising categories from other Websites, television, newspapers, magazines, newsletters or other new media.\nAs a general matter, the continued fragmentation of digital media has intensified competition for advertising revenues. Advertising revenue could decline if the relationships we have with high-traffic Websites are adversely affected. In addition, our advertising revenue may decline as a result of pricing pressures on Internet advertising rates due to industry developments, changes in consumer interest in the financial media and other factors in and outside of our control, including in particular as a result of any significant or prolonged downturn in, or periods of extreme volatility of, the financial markets. As the use of mobile accelerates as the \u201cgo-to\u201d method of consuming digital content, our ability to monetize mobile content, for which CPMs are lower, is increasingly important. Also, our advertising revenue would be adversely affected if advertisers sought to use third-party networks to attempt to reach our audience while they visit third-party sites instead of purchasing advertising from us to reach our audience on our own sites. Further, any advertising revenue that is performance-based may be adversely impacted by the foregoing and other factors. If our advertising revenue significantly decreases, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to the headwinds facing digital media advertising, general economic weakness and uncertainty in the United States and globally, while improved, continue to adversely affect and may continue to adversely affect our advertising revenues.\nFinally, our top five advertisers accounted for approximately 38% of our total media revenue in 2015. Furthermore, although we have advertisers from outside the financial services industry, such as travel, automotive and technology, a large proportion of our top advertisers are concentrated in financial services, particularly in the online brokerage business. Recent consolidation of financial institutions and other factors could cause us to lose a number of our top advertisers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As is typical in the advertising industry, generally, our advertising contracts have short notice cancellation provisions.\nMany individuals are increasingly using mobile devices rather than personal computers to access news and other online services. If we are unable to effectively provide our content and subscription products to users of these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access news and other online services through mobile devices continues to increase at a rapid rate. To date, we have not been able to generate revenue from advertising or content delivered to mobile devices as effectively as we have for advertising or content delivered to personal computers. As our members increasingly use mobile devices to access our online services, if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our content on mobile devices, if these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected. Additionally, as new devices, such as wearables, and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such new services and products.\nRisks associated with our strategic acquisitions could adversely affect our business.\nWe have completed several acquisitions in recent years, and we may make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and services of the acquired companies as well as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, there are expenses incurred in connection with these acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of operations and services, as well as the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our operations or that we will be able to realize the benefits intended in such acquisitions. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will complete any future acquisitions or that acquisitions will contribute favorably to our operations and financial condition. For example, in October 2014 we acquired Management Diagnostics Limited (\u201cMDL\u201d), a relationship capital management company that offers BoardEx and is headquartered in the U.K. with locations in New York, New York and Chennai, India. This acquisition has helped us expand internationally and is helping to accelerate our transition from primarily serving retail investors to also becoming an indispensable data, news and information source for institutional clients, but we can provide no assurances that our long term strategic objectives will be attained.\nAlthough due diligence and detailed analysis is conducted before these acquisitions are completed, there can be no assurance that such steps can or will fully expose all hidden problems that the acquired company may have. In addition, our valuations and analyses are based on numerous assumptions, and there can be no assurance that those assumptions will be proven correct or appropriate. Relevant facts and circumstances of our analyses could have changed over time, and new facts and circumstances may come to light as to render the previous assumptions and the valuations and analyses based thereon incorrect.\nOur foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of MDL in October 2014 significantly increased the importance of foreign markets to our future operations and growth and also exposes us to a number of additional risks. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our data collection, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. We may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad. Since approximately half of MDL\u2019s revenues are generated outside of the United States, the Company\u2019s acquisition of MDL significantly increases our exposure to these risks.\nWe are now subject to the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) regulations relating to privacy, including the EU Directive on Data Protection, which imposes significant restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that are more stringent and impose greater burdens on businesses than current privacy standards in the United States. One such burden is a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. The United States is one such country and this prohibition and the fact we are subject to the EU regulations may impact on our ability to carry out certain aspects of our business in the United States. The EU has recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which will result in greater compliance burdens for companies with users and operations in Europe over the next two years. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nForeign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. The U.K. Bribery Act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the U.K. Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill and other intangibles becomes impaired, we may be required to record a reduction in such amount which would negatively impact our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $43.3 million and net intangible assets of $18.7 million. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. Under the provisions of ASC 350, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. We perform our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of October 1 each year. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceed their implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. In the past we recorded impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. Although currently we do not anticipate any impairment, we may have to record additional impairments in the future which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSystem failure or interruption may result in reduced traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation.\nOur ability to provide timely, updated information depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. Similarly, our ability to track, measure and report the delivery of advertisements on our Websites depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of third-party systems. Our operations depend in part on the protection of our data systems and those of our third-party providers against damage from human error, natural disasters, fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, terrorist acts, vandalism, sabotage, and other adverse events. Although we utilize the services of third-party cloud computing providers, specifically Amazon Web Services with procedural security systems and have put in place certain other disaster recovery measures, including offsite storage of backup data, these disaster recovery measures currently may not be comprehensive enough and there is no guarantee that our Internet access and other data operations will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Any system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness of our Websites could result in reduced traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation, brand and relations with our advertisers and strategic partners. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for such losses. In such event, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Ratings models, purchased from a third party, were written in legacy technologies that do not have robust backup or recovery provisions. The ongoing production of valid ratings data is based upon the successful continued migration of these legacy systems to more robust and current systems. The hardware platforms upon which these applications run have been migrated to more modern equipment within our multi-redundant hosting facilities; however, many of the core application code remains in production. Migration of such complex applications is time consuming, resource intensive and can pose considerable risk.\nDisruptions to our third-party technology providers and management systems could harm our business and lead to loss of customers and advertisers.\nWe depend on third-party technology providers and management systems to distribute our content and process transactions. For example, we use Fastly and Amazon Web Services to help us efficiently distribute our content to customers. We also use a third party vendor to process credit cards for our subscriptions. We exercise no control over our third-party vendors, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays in their operations. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could have significant adverse impacts on our business reputation, advertiser and customer relations and operating results. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nWe may face liability for, or incur costs to defend, information published in our services.\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims for defamation, libel, copyright or trademark infringement, fraud or negligence, or other theories of liability, in each case relating to the articles, commentary, investment recommendations, ratings, or other information we provide through our services. We maintain insurance to provide coverage with respect to such claims, but our insurance may not adequately protect us against these claims. For example, from time to time, actions filed against us include claims for punitive damages, which are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies.\nFailure to establish and maintain successful strategic relationships with other companies could decrease our subscriber and user base.\nWe rely in part on establishing and maintaining successful strategic relationships with other companies to attract and retain a portion of our current subscriber and reader base and to enhance public awareness of our brands. In particular, our relationships with Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money and CNN Money, which index our headlines and/or host our content including our video offerings, have been important components of our effort to enhance public awareness of our brands, which awareness we believe also is enhanced by the public appearances of James J. Cramer, in particular on his \u201cMad Money\u201d television program and on \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d, both of which are telecast by CNBC. If we do not successfully establish and maintain our strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if these relationships do not attract significant revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nDifficulties associated with our brand development may harm our ability to attract subscribers to our paid services and users to our advertising-supported services.\nWe believe that maintaining and growing awareness about our services is an important aspect of our efforts to continue to attract users. Our efforts to build brand awareness may not be cost effective or successful in reaching potential users, and some potential users may not be receptive to our marketing efforts or advertising campaigns. Accordingly, we can make no assurances that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of our brands or in persuading potential users to subscribe to or use our services.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain subscribers to our subscription services may be affected by the perceived quality of the content, including the performance of investment ideas we publish, and other factors.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain subscribers to our subscription services depends on the quality of the content of the services, including the performance of any investment ideas published in the services. To the extent the returns on such portfolios fail to meet or exceed the expectations of our subscribers or the performance of relevant benchmarks, our ability to attract new subscribers or retain existing subscribers to such services will be adversely affected. Additionally, factors such as the expiration of temporary product promotions, changes in our renewal policies or practices for subscribers to our subscription services, or changes in the degree of credit card failures could have a material impact on customer retention.\nFailure to maintain our reputation for trustworthiness may harm our business.\nOur brand is based upon the integrity of our editorial content. We are proud of the trust and reputation for quality we have developed over the course of 20 years and we seek to renew and deepen that trust continually. We require all of our content contributors, whether employees or outside contributors, to adhere to strict standards of integrity, including standards that are designed to prevent any actual or potential conflict of interest, and to comply with all applicable laws, including securities laws. The occurrence of events such as our misreporting a news story, the non-disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of our content contributors, the manipulation of a security by one or more of our content contributors, or any other breach of our compliance policies, could harm our reputation for trustworthiness and reduce readership. In addition, in the event the reputation of any of our directors, officers, key contributors, writers or editorial staff were harmed for any other reason, we could suffer as result of our association with the individual, and also could suffer if the quantity or value of future services we received from the individual was diminished. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected if the securities markets and/or mergers and acquisitions activity decline, are stagnant or experience extreme volatility.\nOur results of operations, particularly related to subscription revenue, are affected by certain economic factors, including the performance of the securities markets and mergers and acquisitions activity. While we believe investors and dealmakers are seeking more information related to the financial markets and mergers and acquisitions from trusted sources, the existence of adverse or stagnant securities markets conditions and lack of investor confidence could result in investors decreasing their interest in investor-related and deal-related publications, which could adversely affect the subscription revenue we derive from our subscription based Websites and newsletters.\nWe may not adequately protect our own intellectual property and may incur costs to defend against, or face liability for, intellectual property infringement claims of others.\nTo protect our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d), we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patent protection, confidentiality agreements and various other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, customers, strategic partners and others. We own several trademark registrations and copyrights, and have pending trademark and patent applications, in the United States. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, employee handbook, and other internal policies seek to protect our IP against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We also utilize various tools to police the Internet to monitor piracy and unauthorized use of our content. Finally, whether we are contracting out our IP or licensing third-party content and/or technology, we incorporate contractual provisions to protect our IP and seek indemnification for any third-party infringement claims.\nHowever, we cannot provide any guarantee that the foregoing provisions will be adequate to protect us from third-party claims or that these provisions will prevent the theft of our IP, as we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our IP rights. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, any infringement claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm our business.\nOur services face intense competition from other providers of business, personal finance, investing and ratings content, including:\n\u00b7 online services or Websites focused on business, personal finance or investing, such as The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, CNN Money, Forbes.com, Reuters.com, Bloomberg.com, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider and CNBC.com, as well as financial portals such as Yahoo! Finance, AOL Daily Finance and MSN Money;\n\u00b7 publishers and distributors of traditional media focused on business, personal finance or investing, including print and radio, such as The Wall Street Journal and financial talk radio programs, and business television networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC and the Fox Business Channel;\n\u00b7 investment newsletter publishers, such as The Motley Fool, Stansberry & Associates Investment Research and Investor Place Media;\n\u00b7 other providers of business intelligence on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and financings, such as Bloomberg and Mergermarket Group;\n\u00b7 established ratings services, such as Standard & Poor\u2019s, Morningstar and Lipper, with respect to our Ratings products, and rate database providers such as Informa and SNL Kagan, with respect to our RateWatch products; and\n\u00b7 other providers of director, officer and dealmaker data, including Bloomberg, S&P Capital IQ, Dow Jones, The New York Stock Exchange, LexisNexis, Relationship Science, and Thomson Reuters.\nAdditionally, advances in technology have reduced the cost of production and online distribution of print, audio and video content, which has resulted in the proliferation of providers of free content. We compete with these other publications and services for customers, including subscribers, readers and viewers of our video content, for advertising revenue, and for employees and contributors to our services. Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the quality, originality, timeliness, insightfulness and trustworthiness of our content and that of our competitors, the popularity and performance of our contributors, the success of our recommendations and research, our ability to introduce products and services that keep pace with new investing trends, our ability to adopt and deploy new technologies for running our business, the ease of use of services developed either by us or our competitors and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, media technologies and platforms are rapidly evolving and the rate of consumption of media on various platforms may shift rapidly. If we fail to offer our content through the platforms in which our audience desires to consume it, or if we do not have offerings on such platforms that are as compelling as those of our competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, the economics of distributing content through new platforms may be materially different from the economics of distributing content through our current platforms and any such difference may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face government regulation and legal uncertainties.\nWe are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly-owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, including privacy regulations and taxes levied adopted at the local, state, national and international levels. In recent years, consumer protection regulations, particularly in connection with the Internet, have become more aggressive, and we expect that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business due to increased compliance costs.\nForeign exchange variability could adversely affect our consolidated operating results\nOur growth strategy contemplates increased services to foreign and domestic customers. As a consequence of expanding the footprint of the Company to markets outside of the United States, in particular the United Kingdom, we will be exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We do not engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk. Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies, principally the British pound, decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income would likely be offset in part by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken against the British pound, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Also, by virtue of our cross-border operations, we will be subject to the risks normally associated with such activities, including those relating to delayed payments from customers in some countries or difficulties in the collection of receivables generally.\nIn addition, we will be exposed to the risk of changes in social, political and economic conditions in the countries where we engage in business. Political and economic instability in these countries could adversely affect our business activities and operations. Unexpected changes in local regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers and price or exchange controls could limit operations and make the repatriation of profits difficult. In addition, the uncertainty of differing legal environments could limit our ability to effectively enforce our rights in some markets.\nAny failure of our internal security measures or breach of our privacy protections could cause us to lose users and subject us to liability.\nUsers who subscribe to our paid subscription services are required to furnish certain personal information (including name, mailing address, phone number, email address and credit card information), which we use to administer our services. We also require users of some of our free services and features to provide us with some personal information during the membership registration process. Additionally, we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real-time credit card authorization and verification, and at times rely on third parties, including technology consulting firms, to help protect our infrastructure from security threats. We may have to continue to expend capital and other resources on the hardware and software infrastructure that provides security for our processing, storage and transmission of personal information.\nIn this regard, our users depend on us to keep their personal information safe and private and not to disclose it to third parties or permit our security to be breached. However, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments, including improper acts by third parties, may result in a compromise or breach of the security measures we use to protect the personal information of our users. If a party were to compromise or breach our information security measures or those of our agents, such party could misappropriate the personal information of our users, cause interruptions in our operations, expose us to significant liabilities and reporting obligations, damage our reputation and discourage potential users from registering to use our Websites or other services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize various third parties to assist with various aspects of our business. Some of these partnerships require the exchange of user information. This is required because some features of our Websites may be hosted by these third parties. While we take significant measures to guarantee the security of our customer data and require such third parties to comply with our privacy and security policies as well as generally be contractually bound to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to any claims related to any breach of relevant privacy laws related to the service provider, we are still at risk if any of these third-party systems are breached or compromised and may in such event suffer a material adverse effect to business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022 providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022 not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 permitting an amendment of our certificate of incorporation only through a super-majority vote of the stockholders;\n\u2022 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022 require that, to the fullest extent permitted by law and unless we consent to an alternate forum, certain proceedings against or involving us or our directors, officers, or employees be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware;\n\u2022 limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022 requiring advance notification for stockholder director nominations and other proposals.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIf our ability to use our tax operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes is limited, we may not receive the benefit of those assets.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $154 million as of December 31, 2015, available to offset future taxable income through 2035. These net operating losses date back to December 1999 and will begin expiring in 2019. Our ability to fully utilize these net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of the carryforward period attributable to these net operating losses. Furthermore, as a result of prior ownership changes under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, approximately $123 million of these net operating losses will be subject to certain limitations.\nInvestment of our cash carries risks.\nFinancial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. We maintain all of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in seven financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions. No assurances can be made that the third-party institutions will retain acceptable credit ratings or investment practices. Investment decisions of third parties and market conditions may adversely affect our cash balances and financial condition. While we believe our investment policy is conservative, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses on any of our investments.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nAs a Public Company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have evaluated and tested our internal controls in order to allow management to report on our internal controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we are not able to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we would be required to disclose material weaknesses if they develop or are uncovered and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such action could negatively impact the perception of us in the financial market and our business.\nIn addition, our internal controls may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements, we may be notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance. Our common stock recently closed below $1.00 per share on February 25, 2016 and has been closing at or below $1.00 per share since that date and through the filing of this report. If the price per share of our common stock were to fall below NASDAQ listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. If we are notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, we would regain compliance if our common stock trades above $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days during the 180 days following notice of non-compliance. We may also be permitted to transfer our listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would provide us an additional 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement. If our common stock is delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock could be limited. In addition, our common stock could be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutional investor interest.", "PERMNO": 86924, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TST"}
