In evaluating our business, investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all other information included in this Annual Report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. These risk factors contain, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. The order in which the following risks are presented is not intended to reflect the magnitude of the risks described. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nWe have incurred net operating losses throughout our history. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception in February 1995, except for 2013, including net losses of $16.3 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.7 million. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our discovery and development activities. We anticipate that our operating losses will continue over the next several years. While we reported net income in 2013, we do not anticipate that we will have net income again in the foreseeable future.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of future expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale, and to date we have not generated any product revenue. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, upfront and milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements, government grants and capital lease and equipment financing. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth or contraction of our expenses and the level and rate of growth, if any, of our revenues. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our products successfully, obtain the required regulatory approvals, manufacture and market our proposed products successfully or have such products manufactured and marketed by others, and gain market acceptance for such products. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability. We may never be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to cover our expenses. Our plans to advance our own product candidates are dependent on receiving additional financing, which may include milestone payments from our collaboration agreements, public or private equity or debt financings, new collaborative relationships, or other available financing transactions.\nWe will require substantial additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nDevelopment of our Tarmogen product candidates will require substantial additional funds to conduct research, development and clinical trials necessary to bring such product candidates to market and to establish manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our preclinical and non-clinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress and costs of our manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;\n\u00b7\nthe cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory proceedings, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, review of any BLA that we submit;\n\u00b7\npayments required with respect to development milestones we achieve under our in-licensing agreements, including any such payments to University of Colorado or the National Institutes of Health, pursuant to our license agreements with them;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u00b7\ncompeting technological efforts and market developments;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our existing research relationships;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish collaborative arrangements to the extent necessary;\n\u00b7\nrevenues received from any future products;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to achieve and receive milestone payments for products licensed to collaborators; and\n\u00b7\npayments received under any future strategic collaborations.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to complete our clinical trial programs for our product candidates, build commercial capabilities, develop our pipeline and expand our corporate infrastructure. We believe that based on our current operations, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents will allow us to fund our operating plan through 2015. Our plans to advance our own product candidates are dependent on receiving additional financing, which may include milestone payments from our collaboration agreements, public or private equity or debt financings, new collaborative relationships, or other available financing transactions. However, our operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital faster or slower than we currently anticipate or to alter our operations. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect.\nThere can be no assurance that our revenue and expense forecasts will prove to be accurate, and any change in the foregoing assumptions could require us to obtain additional financing earlier than anticipated. There is a risk of delay or failure at any stage of developing a product candidate, and the time required and costs involved in successfully accomplishing our objectives cannot be accurately predicted. Actual drug research and development costs could substantially exceed budgeted amounts, which could force us to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs.\nWe may never be able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to cover our expenses. Until we do, we expect to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative relationships, or other available financing transactions. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and such financings could be dilutive to existing security holders. Moreover, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborators, such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs. Our failure to obtain adequate financing when needed and on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nRisks Relating to Clinical Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we, or our collaborators, Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and the NCI, fail to successfully complete clinical trials, fail to obtain regulatory approval or fail to successfully commercialize our Tarmogen product candidates, our business would be harmed and the value of our securities would decline.\nInvestors should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting a pre-commercial biopharmaceutical company. We have not completed clinical development for any of our product candidates. Our lead Tarmogen product candidate is GS-4774, which has been exclusively licensed to Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, and which is in Phase 2 clinical testing. The GI-6300 program, including GI-6301, our oncology product targeting cancers expressing the brachyury protein, have been exclusively licensed to Celgene, which is planning a Phase 2 clinical trial in chordoma.\nGilead is responsible for the clinical development and any future commercialization activities for GS-4774. The GI-6300 program, including GI-6301, which is being developed for the treatment of Brachyury-expressing cancers, was exclusively licensed to Celgene. Celgene will lead future clinical development and any future commercialization activities for GI-6301. As a result, we are completely dependent on their ability and willingness to fund and execute clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities. The Phase 2 program for GI-6301 in chordoma will be run at NCI. We will have no control over the execution of this trial, including the rate of and completion of enrollment of the trial. We have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that Celgene and Gilead dedicate to the development of our product candidates, potentially negatively impacting the likelihood of clinical or commercial success for these products candidates.\nRegulatory agencies, including the FDA, must approve GS-4774, GI-6301, GI-4000 and any of our other product candidates before they can be marketed or sold. The approval process is lengthy, requires significant capital expenditures, and the outcome is uncertain. Our, or our collaborator\u2019s, ability to obtain regulatory approval of any Tarmogen product candidate depends on, among other things, completion of additional clinical trials, whether such clinical trials demonstrate statistically significant efficacy with safety issues that do not potentially outweigh the therapeutic benefit of the product candidates, and whether the regulatory agencies agree that the data from our future clinical trials are sufficient to support approval for any of our product candidates. The final results of our current and future clinical trials may not meet FDA or other regulatory agencies\u2019 requirements to approve a product candidate for marketing, and the regulatory agencies may otherwise determine that our manufacturing processes or facilities are insufficient to support approval. We or our collaborators may need to conduct more clinical trials than we currently anticipate. Even if we do receive FDA or other regulatory agency approval, we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing approved product candidates. If any of these events occur, our business could be materially harmed and the value of our securities would decline.\nWe, or our collaborators, may face delays in completing our clinical trials, and may not be able to complete them at all.\nClinical trials necessary to support an application for approval to market any Tarmogen product candidates have not been completed. Our, or our collaborators\u2019, current and future clinical trials may be delayed, unsuccessful, or terminated as a result of many factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndelays in designing an appropriate clinical trial protocol and reaching agreement on trial design with investigators and regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or changes in regulatory requirements, policy or guidelines;\n\u00b7\ndelays in establishing necessary clinical trial sites or the need to establish new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nthe actual performance of CROs and clinical trial sites in ensuring the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndeveloping and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects experienced by subjects in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidates at the sufficient level of quality for use in clinical trials; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in achieving study endpoints and completing data analysis for a trial.\nIn addition to these factors, our trials may be delayed, unsuccessful or terminated because:\n\u00b7\nregulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, may not authorize us to commence or continue a clinical trial, including the protocol for the Phase 2 chordoma trial of GI-6301 under review by the NCI IRB. The NCI IRB may recommend changes, or not approve the protocol at all;\n\u00b7\nregulators or IRBs may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about patient safety;\n\u00b7\nwe may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if we believe that they expose the participating patients to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\npatients may not complete clinical trials due to safety issues, side effects, such as injection site discomfort, a belief that they are receiving placebo instead of our product candidates, the length of follow-up periods, or other reasons;\n\u00b7\npatients with serious diseases included in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse medical events for reasons that may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nin those trials where our product candidate is being tested in combination with one or more other therapies, deaths may occur that may be attributable to the other therapies;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after administration of our Tarmogen product candidates, preventing us from collecting the data required by our study protocol;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates may demonstrate a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays in manufacture may delay or hinder completely ongoing or future clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndiagnostic tests we or our collaborators develop, such as the BDX-001 diagnostic for a potential future GI-4000 clinical trial in pancreas cancer patients, may not effectively identify patients that respond to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty in finding suitable patients to participate in our, or our collaborators\u2019, clinical trials due to a number of factors, including competing clinical trials, a limited number of clinical trial sites, or the inability to identify a sufficient number of patients that meet trial eligibility criteria, including any diagnostic tests being developed by us or our collaborators, including the BDX-001 diagnostic;\n\u00b7\npersonnel conducting clinical trials may fail to properly administer our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nour collaborators may decide not to pursue further clinical trials, or may allocate resources to other clinical trials, including clinical trials of competitor product candidates.\nWe could encounter delays if our clinical trials are suspended or terminated by us, by IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Boards for such trials or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including potential for unacceptable safety risks to patients, inspection of the clinical trial operation or trial site, changes in government regulations or administrative actions.\nIn addition, we rely on academic institutions, physician practices and CROs to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. For example several of our other trials are being conducted by the NCI, including GI-6207-02 for MTC, the GI-6301-01 Phase 1 trial and the planned GI-6301 Phase 2 trial in chordoma. We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations. We also may rely on CROs to perform our data management and analysis. They may not provide these services as required or in a timely or compliant manner, and we may be held legally responsible for any or all of their performance failures or inadequacies.\nMoreover, our development costs will increase because we will be required to complete additional or larger clinical trials for our Tarmogen product candidates prior to FDA or other regulatory approval. If we or our collaborators experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nClinical trials for our product candidates require us to identify and enroll a large number of patients with the disease under investigation. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics, in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by factors including:\n\u00b7\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u00b7\ndesign of the trial protocol;\n\u00b7\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u00b7\neligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u00b7\nlack of a sufficient number of patients who meet the enrollment criteria for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays required to characterize tumor types to allow us to select the proper product candidate, which may lead patients to seek to enroll in other clinical trials or seek alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u00b7\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians;\n\u00b7\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after administration of our Tarmogen product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndiagnostic tests we or our collaborators develop may not effectively identify patients that respond to our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nWe have experienced difficulties enrolling patients in our smaller clinical trials due to lack of referrals and may experience similar difficulties in the future. For example, the GI-4000-05 trial conducted at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University commenced enrollment in August 2010. Eleven subjects were enrolled as of December 31, 2014. This enrollment rate was slower than we had anticipated and enrollment has been discontinued.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number or diversity of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, either of which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Tarmogen product candidates are based on a novel technology, which may raise development issues we may not be able to resolve, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may keep us from being able to develop our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are based on our novel Tarmogen technology platform. There can be no assurance that development problems related to our novel technology will not arise in the future that cause significant delays or that we are not able to resolve.\nRegulatory approval of novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. The novelty of our platform may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. For example, the FDA could require additional studies or characterization related to our use of heat-inactivated yeast that may be difficult to perform.\nThe novel nature of our product candidates also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel, particularly for research, development, commercial and manufacturing positions. For example, study personnel may administer the wrong version of our product candidates or assign study therapy to the wrong study group, resulting in potential disqualification of subjects from data analysis. These factors could potentially cause a trial to fail for a reason unrelated to the efficacy of our product candidates. If we are unable to hire and retain the necessary personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited. Any such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to use molecular profiling of patients to target our Tarmogen product candidates to those patients we believe may be most likely to benefit from them, including profiling necessary to determine which version of our GI-4000 series should be given to a patient with Ras mutated cancer and determining which patients should be enrolled in our GI-4000 pancreas cancer trials based on the BDX-001 proteomic signature. The BDX-001 test is controlled by Biodesix, Inc. and we may not be able to obtain rights to use the test on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain rights to BDX-001, we will not be able to use it in clinical development or commercialization. If we do not have access to BDX-001, our GI-4000 trials may not be successful and we may never obtain approval to market GI-4000. There has been limited experience in our industry in prospective development of companion diagnostics required to perform the required testing. To be successful, we will need to address a number of scientific, technical and logistical challenges related to the use of companion diagnostics in the development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States regulate companion diagnostics. Companion diagnostics require separate or coordinated regulatory approval prior to commercialization of the therapeutic product. The regulatory pathway for co-development of therapeutics and companion diagnostics could delay our development programs or delay or prevent eventual marketing approval for our product candidates that may otherwise be approvable. For our oncology product candidate, GI-4000 we may require in vitro companion diagnostics that will help identify pancreas cancer patients we believe may be likely to benefit from our product candidates. In vitro diagnostics are tests used on specimens taken from the patient being tested.\nThe FDA may limit our ability to use retrospective data, otherwise disagree with our approaches to trial design, biomarker qualification, clinical and analytical validity, and clinical utility, or make us repeat aspects of a trial or initiate new trials in order to obtain approval of our therapeutic and companion diagnostic product candidates.\nAssays that can be used as companion diagnostics for detecting Ras mutations are commercially available, but in some cases they do not yet have regulatory approval for use as companion diagnostics. In future clinical trials, we may use commercially available companion diagnostics or we may co-develop companion diagnostics ourselves or with collaborators. We have limited experience in the development of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing necessary diagnostics to pair with those product candidates that require a companion diagnostic.\nCertain proteomic analyses have been performed on plasma samples from 90 of the subjects from the GI-4000-02 trial, potentially identifying a patient selection test named BDX-001 for future trials. Proteomic analyses were not specified in the original trial protocol for GI-4000-02 and the predictive value of the proteomic analyses will need to be validated in another clinical trial. We were only able to review a limited number of samples from the subjects in the trial and future analysis may not confirm the analytical results we have observed to date. Future testing with a companion diagnostic designed to detect the specific protein pattern identified by the initial proteomic testing may show a different proportion of the specific protein signatures which were correlated with later recurrence of the cancer and it may also fail to show the specific protein signature is predictive of the response to GI-4000.\nGiven our limited experience in developing diagnostics, we expect to rely in part on third parties for their design and manufacture. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our product candidates that require such diagnostics, or experience delays in doing so, the development of our product candidates may be adversely affected, our product candidates may not receive marketing approval and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any products that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business could be materially harmed.\nResults of earlier studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the design or results of later-stage clinical trials. The positive results generated to date in clinical trials for our Tarmogen product candidates do not ensure that later clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. While we have observed statistically significant improvements in the outcomes of some of our clinical trials, many of the improvements we have seen have not reached statistical significance. The test for the specific proteomic signature, called BDX-001, which we have identified through proteomic testing of subjects from our GI-4000-02 trial, may fail to predict which subjects respond to GI-4000 in our future pancreas cancer clinical trials. Statistical significance is a statistical term that means that an effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In order to be approved, product candidates must demonstrate that their effect on patients\u2019 diseases in the trial is statistically significant. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Early clinical trials frequently enroll patient populations that are different from the patient populations in later trials, resulting in different outcomes in later clinical trials from those in earlier stage clinical trials. In addition, adverse events may not occur in early clinical trials and only emerge in larger, late-stage clinical trials or after commercialization. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials. If later stage clinical trials do not demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates we will not be able to market them and our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have not completed clinical development of any of our product candidates and do not have any products approved for sale by the FDA or any other regulatory bodies. Regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.\nWe have discussions with and obtain guidance from regulatory authorities regarding certain aspects of our clinical development activities. These discussions are not binding commitments on the part of regulatory authorities. Under certain circumstances, regulatory authorities may revise or retract previous guidance during the course of our clinical activities or after the completion of our clinical trials. A regulatory authority may also disqualify a clinical trial in whole or in part from consideration in support of approval of a potential product for commercial sale or otherwise deny approval of that product. Prior to regulatory approval, a regulatory authority may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under a regulatory authority review. In the United States, these outside experts are convened through the FDA\u2019s Advisory Committee process, which would report to the FDA and make recommendations that may ultimately differ from the views of the FDA.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies may delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be considered safe or effective;\n\u00b7\nour manufacturing processes or facilities may not meet the applicable requirements;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the agencies\u2019 approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part, for example, the FDA may require us to submit a separate BLA for each product version of GI-4000;\n\u00b7\ndifferent divisions of the FDA are reviewing different product candidates and those divisions may have different requirements for approval; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory law, FDA or foreign regulatory agency organization, or personnel may result in different requirements for approval than anticipated.\nOur product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or their advisors may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nAny delay in or failure to receive or maintain approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well designed.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations governing clinical studies, or other applicable foreign government guidelines, and are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and may require large numbers of test subjects. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies or us for various reasons, including:\n\u00b7\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u00b7\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\nthe time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected;\n\u00b7\ndeaths or other adverse events arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial administration of our Tarmogen product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies;\n\u00b7\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards; and\n\u00b7\ninsufficient quantities of the product candidate might be available to complete the trials.\nIn addition, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments to our clinical trial protocols may require resubmission to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Due to these and other factors, our Tarmogen product candidates could take longer to gain regulatory approval than we expect or we may never gain approval for any product candidates, which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the commercialization of our Tarmogen product candidates.\nCertain of our product candidates are being and will be studied in clinical trials conducted by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, and in investigator-initiated clinical trials, the conduct of which we do not control.\nEarly clinical studies of our GI-6207 and GI-6301 product candidates are being conducted in collaboration with and under the direction of the NCI. These include a Phase 1 trial of GI-6301 in patients with metastatic cancer and chordoma, a planned Phase 2 trial of GI-6301 in patients with chordoma, and a Phase 2 clinical trial of GI-6207 in patients with medullary thyroid cancer, or MTC. We expect to continue to supply drugs for these trials and otherwise support similar trials in the future. In addition, there is an investigator-initiated clinical trial ongoing with our GI-4000 product candidate, a Phase 2a clinical study in colorectal cancer at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University. We do not control the design protocols, administration or conduct of these trials and, as a result, we are subject to risks associated with the way these types of trials are conducted, in particular should any problems arise. These risks include difficulties or delays in communicating with investigators or administrators, procedural delays and other timing issues, inappropriate trial design or trial protocols and difficulties or differences in interpreting data. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials or the trials not being conducted according to protocols may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business and lead to a decline in the trading price of our securities.\nWe do not control the conduct of certain clinical trials conducted by our collaborators, Gilead and Celgene.\nWe have exclusively licensed two of our Tarmogen product candidates to collaborators for further clinical development and commercialization. GS-4774 is licensed to Gilead and the GI-6300 program, including GI-6301, is licensed to Celgene. Control for the GS-4774 program, including but not limited to future clinical development, regulatory strategy and any commercialization activities, has been transferred to Gilead under the terms of our collaboration agreement. Control of the GI-6300 program, including but not limited to future clinical development, regulatory strategy, and any commercialization activities, has been transferred to Celgene. As a result, we do not have control over the design protocols, administration or conduct for any future trials and we are therefore subject to risks associated with the way these types of trials are conducted, in particular should any problems arise. These risks include difficulties or delays in communicating with investigators or administrators, procedural delays and other timing issues, inappropriate trial design or trial protocols and difficulties or differences in interpreting data. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials or the trials not being conducted according to protocols may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of these product candidates, which would adversely affect our business and lead to a decline in the trading price of our securities.\nAny product candidate for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate that we, or our collaborators obtain marketing approval for, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, post-approval stability data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to ongoing requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, reports, registration and listing and annual payment requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval will be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use. If we market our products outside of their approved indications, we will be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with these products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u00b7\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7\nrecall of products, fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u00b7\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we, or our collaborators, are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we, or our collaborators, are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, any marketing approval that was obtained could be lost, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf we, or our collaborators, are unable to comply with foreign regulatory requirements or obtain foreign regulatory approvals, our ability to develop foreign markets for our products could be impaired.\nSales of our products outside the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials, marketing approval, manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement. These regulatory requirements vary greatly from country to country. As a result, the time required to obtain approvals outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval and we may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities could require additional testing. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products.\nDeveloping product candidates in combination with other therapies may lead to unforeseen side effects or failures in our clinical trials.\nWe, and our collaborators, are studying our product candidates in clinical trials in combination with approved therapies, including chemotherapies and antivirals, and we anticipate that if any Tarmogen product candidates are approved for marketing, they will be approved to be used only in combination with other therapies. Our, and our collaborators\u2019, development programs and planned studies carry all the risks inherent in drug development activities, including the risk that they will fail to demonstrate meaningful efficacy or acceptable safety. In addition, our development programs are subject to additional regulatory, commercial, manufacturing and other risks because of the use of other therapies in combination with our product candidates. For example, the other therapies may lead to toxicities that are improperly attributed to our product candidates or the combination of our product candidates with other therapies may result in toxicities that the product candidate or other therapy does not produce when used alone. The other therapies we are using in combination may be removed from the market and thus be unavailable for testing or commercial use with any of our approved products. The other therapies we are using in combination may be replaced with newer therapies that may be effective without our product candidates or that are not compatible with our product candidates. Testing product candidates in combination with other therapies may increase the risk of significant adverse effects or test failures. The timing, outcome and cost of developing products to be used in combination with other therapies is difficult to predict and dependent on a number of factors that are outside our reasonable control. If any safety or toxicity issues arise in these clinical trials or with any approved products, the products may not be approved, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability.\nCompetitive products for treatment of pancreas cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, MTC, chordoma and chronic hepatitis B infection may reduce or eliminate the commercial opportunity for our Tarmogen product candidates.\nThe clinical and commercial landscape for pancreas cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, MTC, chordoma and chronic hepatitis B infection is rapidly changing. New data from commercial and clinical-stage products continue to emerge. It is possible that these data may alter current standards of care, completely precluding us from further developing our Tarmogen product candidates, or getting them approved by regulatory agencies. Further, it is possible that we may initiate a clinical trial or trials for these product candidates, only to find that data from competing products make it impossible for us to complete enrollment in these trials, resulting in our inability to file for marketing approval with regulatory agencies. Even if these products are approved for marketing in a particular indication or indications, they may have limited sales due to particularly intense competition in these markets.\nWe expect to depend on existing and future collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to complete the development of these product candidates.\nWe currently have a collaboration and option agreement, or Option Agreement, with Celgene for the development of our oncology product candidates. Under the Option Agreement, Celgene has a worldwide exclusive license to the GI-6300 program, including GI-6301. Celgene did not exercise its option to GI-4000 and returned all rights and development responsibility, including any future expenses, to us. Gilead has taken a worldwide exclusive license to all of our hepatitis B virus, or HBV, Tarmogen product candidates. Celgene and Gilead can terminate their respective collaborations with us at any time, subject to certain notice provisions. We plan to seek third-party collaborators for the development of certain other Tarmogen product candidates.\nUnder our current arrangements with Celgene and Gilead, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development of our product candidates. This is also likely to be true for any future collaborations with third parties. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates pose the following risks to us:\n\u00b7\nCelgene may not exercise any more options to any of our oncology product candidates, for example, Celgene did not elect to exercise their option to license GI-4000;\n\u00b7\nCelgene may return all rights to GI-6301 to us;\n\u00b7\nGilead may return all rights to HBV product candidates to us;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources, if any, that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates, such as Celgene not exercising more of its option to any oncology programs other than GI-6301, or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u00b7\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may elect to take over manufacturing, for example, Gilead has elected to take over manufacturing for GS-4774, rather than retain us as the manufacturer. Collaborators may encounter problems in starting up or gaining approval for their manufacturing facility and so be unable to continue development and manufacturing of product candidates;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and management resources in connection with any collaboration;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to issue equity securities to collaborators that would dilute our existing security holders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of our product candidates, limiting our potential revenues from these products; and\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may experience financial difficulties.\nWe face a number of challenges in seeking additional collaborations. The process to establish a collaboration is complex and any potential discussions may not result in a definitive agreement for many reasons. For example, whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors, such as the design or results of our clinical trials, the potential market for our product candidates, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering our product candidates to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to ownership or the coverage of our intellectual property, and industry and market conditions generally. If we were to determine that additional collaborations for our Tarmogen product candidates are necessary and were unable to enter into such collaborations on acceptable terms, we might elect to delay or scale back the development or commercialization of our product candidates in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time to develop the required physical resources and systems and expertise ourselves.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nWe will need to develop or acquire additional manufacturing and distribution capabilities in order to commercialize any product candidates that obtain marketing approval, and we may encounter unexpected costs or difficulties in doing so.\nIf we independently develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, we will need to invest in acquiring or building additional capabilities and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete future research, development and commercialization efforts. We will require additional investment and validation process development in order to qualify our manufacturing process to manufacture clinical trial materials and commercial material if any of our products are approved for marketing. This investment and validation process development may be expensive and time-consuming. We will require additional personnel with experience in commercial-scale manufacturing, managing of large-scale information technology systems and managing a large-scale distribution system. We will need to add personnel and expand our capabilities, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. To do this effectively, we must:\n\u00b7\nrecruit, hire, train, manage and motivate a growing employee base;\n\u00b7\naccurately forecast demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nassemble and manage the supply chain to ensure our ability to meet demand; and\n\u00b7\nexpand existing operational, manufacturing, financial and management information systems.\nWe may seek FDA approval for our production process and facilities simultaneously with seeking approval for sale of our product candidates. Should we not complete the development of adequate capabilities, including manufacturing capacity, or fail to receive timely approval of our manufacturing process and facilities, our ability to supply clinical trial materials for planned clinical trials or supply products following regulatory approval for sale could be delayed, which would further delay our clinical trials or the period of time when we would be able to generate revenues from the sale of such products, if we are even able to obtain approval or generate revenues at all.\nAdditionally, we may decide to outsource some or all of our manufacturing activities to a third party contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. Under any agreement with a CMO, we would have less control over the timing and quality of manufacturing than if we were to perform such manufacturing ourselves. A CMO would be manufacturing other pharmaceutical products in the same facilities as our Tarmogen product candidates, increasing the risk of cross product contamination. Further, there is no guarantee that any CMO will have adequate capacity for meeting all of our product needs, or be able to manufacture products for an adequate price. There is also no guarantee that any CMO will continue their ongoing operations, causing potential delays in product supply, reduced revenues and other liabilities for us. A CMO may also be subject to regulatory holds or production interruptions for a variety of reasons, which could also cause shortfalls or delays in our product supply.\nAny such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, our collaborators, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. To date, patients who have received Tarmogens have experienced drug-related side effects, including local skin reactions and systemic and constitutional symptoms including muscle aches, fever and fatigue. Subjects have also reported developing a taste in their mouths similar to yeast following injection of our product candidates. In one instance, a patient in the GI-6207 clinical trial who had pleural and pericardial metastases, or cancer in the spaces surrounding the heart and lungs, experienced pleural and pericardial effusions, or fluid buildup in those areas of the body, following immunization with GI-6207. GI-6207 had to be discontinued in this patient because of this adverse event. For this reason, we have excluded patients with large pericardial metastases from current and future clinical trials.\nOur Tarmogen product candidates are intended to stimulate the immune system. As such, results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects, including, but not limited to, adverse immune responses that lead to previously unobserved autoimmune complications or yeast allergies. As a result of any side effects, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development, or deny approval, of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we, our collaborators, or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7\nwe may be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny such event noted in this risk factor could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we cannot demonstrate an acceptable toxicity profile for our product candidates in non-clinical studies, we will not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials or obtain approval for our product candidates.\nIn order to move a product candidate into human clinical trials, we must first demonstrate an acceptable toxicity profile in preclinical testing. Furthermore, in order to obtain approval, we must also demonstrate safety in various non-clinical tests. For example, we are conducting preclinical testing for GI-19000 in anticipation of filing an investigational new drug application, or IND, subject to obtaining additional funding. We may not have conducted or may not conduct the types of non-clinical testing required by regulatory authorities, or future non-clinical tests may indicate that our product candidates are not safe for use. Non-clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and has an uncertain outcome. In addition, success in initial non-clinical testing does not ensure that later non-clinical testing will be successful. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the non-clinical testing process, which could delay or prevent our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7\nour non-clinical testing may produce inconclusive or negative safety results, which may require us to conduct additional non-clinical testing or to abandon product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour product candidates may have unfavorable pharmacology or toxicity characteristics;\n\u00b7\nour product candidates may cause undesirable side effects such as negative immune responses that lead to autoimmune complications;\n\u00b7\nour enrolled patients may have yeast allergies that lead to complications after administration of Tarmogen product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that additional safety testing is required.\nAny such events would increase our costs and could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into additional agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales and marketing infrastructure or any experience in the sales, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. We currently have collaboration agreements with Celgene for the development and commercialization of our oncology product candidates, other than GI-4000, and with Gilead for HBV Tarmogens. We may seek additional third-party collaborators for the commercialization of our other product candidates. In the future, we may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote some of our product candidates if and when they are approved, which would be expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, we may elect to outsource these functions to third parties. Either approach carries significant risks. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and, if done improperly, could delay a product launch and result in limited sales. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit, manage and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of marketing personnel to develop effective marketing materials;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nAs a result of our arrangements with Celgene and Gilead, as well as any other arrangements with third parties we may enter into to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into additional arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have limited control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nThe availability and amount of reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for any potential Tarmogen products, are uncertain.\nIn both U.S. and foreign markets, sales of any Tarmogen products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The future magnitude of our revenues and profitability may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. We cannot predict the effect that private sector or governmental health care reforms may have on our business, and there can be no assurance that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in both the United States and elsewhere, sales of prescription drugs are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. The ability to obtain reimbursement of our products from these parties is a critical factor in the commercial success for any of our products. We do not have any personnel with experience in the establishing reimbursement by government or private insurance plans, and we may not be able to effectively recruit such personnel in the future. Failure to obtain reimbursement could result in reduced or no sales of our products.\nThird-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved health care products. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost-effective or that adequate third-party reimbursement will be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before any of our products are approved for marketing. Adoption of such legislation could further limit reimbursement for medical products and services.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our revenues from future sales of our products. Many foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the ACA, a law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA created a new approval pathway for biosimilars intended to encourage competition and lower prices, and it amended Medicare Part B reimbursement rules for physician-administered biologic products by making the purchase of lower cost biosimilars more attractive to providers reimbursed by Medicare Part B. As the FDA approves biosimilars, it is possible that similar rules will be adopted by commercial managed care organizations. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. Notably, a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.\nMoreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products they produce to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug products. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers\u2019 products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. In the European Union, the Falsified Medicines Directive imposes similar requirements, which are expected to add materially to product costs.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our products and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business and the unique properties of our Tarmogen platform, our success is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel, consultants and advisors. We are dependent on the principal members of our scientific and management staff, particularly Dr. Timothy C. Rodell. The loss of Dr. Rodell\u2019s services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives. We currently maintain key-man life insurance on Dr. Rodell. However, we may not continue to maintain such insurance in the future or the proceeds of such insurance may not be adequate.\nWe will need to recruit a significant number of additional personnel in order to achieve our operating goals. In order to pursue our product development and marketing, reimbursement and sales plans, we will need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, government regulation, manufacturing, marketing and sales, which may strain our existing managerial, operational, regulatory compliance, financial and other resources. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist in formulating our research and development strategy and adhering to complex regulatory requirements. We face competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, our facilities are located in Colorado, which may make attracting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel from outside of Colorado difficult. The failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for the indications that we believe are the most scientifically and commercially promising. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable scientific or commercial products or profitable market opportunities. In addition, we may spend valuable time and managerial and financial resources on research programs and product candidates for specific indications that ultimately do not yield any scientifically or commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the scientific and commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in situations where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole rights to development and commercialization.\nRISKS RELATING TO MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our product candidates at commercial scale, and there can be no assurance that our product candidates can be manufactured in compliance with regulations at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. Our manufacturing facility has not been inspected by regulatory agencies and there can be no assurance that it will be acceptable for licensure by regulatory authorities or that we can contract to build acceptable facilities.\nWe have limited experience in commercial-scale manufacturing of Tarmogens. We may develop our manufacturing capacity in part by expanding our current facility or building additional facilities. This activity would require substantial additional funds and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of qualified employees to staff these facilities. We may not be able to develop commercial-scale manufacturing facilities that are adequate to produce materials for additional later-stage clinical trials or commercial use. Since our product candidates are produced by a biological process, we may find that our recombinant yeast strains will not exhibit the same growth characteristics at sites other than our facility, or do not result in a comparable product. All of our manufacturing of Tarmogen product candidates is currently performed in our Colorado facility. Damage to, or other impairment of, this facility could limit or eliminate our ability to manufacture Tarmogens.\nWe currently rely on CMOs for sterile fill and finish of our products, and these contractors currently fill our product candidates at a scale that is not adequate for commercial supply. Failure to find and maintain satisfactory commercial-scale fill and finish contractors could impair our ability to supply product for clinical and commercial needs. Additionally, we may decide to outsource some or all of our bulk product manufacturing activities to a third party CMO. Failure of any of these contractors to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other regulatory and legal requirements could result in a clinical hold on our clinical trials or other government actions that would limit or eliminate clinical trial and commercial product supply. Under any agreement with a CMO, we would have less control over the timing and quality of manufacturing than if we were perform such manufacturing ourselves. A CMO would be manufacturing other pharmaceutical products in the same facilities as our Tarmogen product candidates, increasing the risk of cross product contamination. Further, there is no guarantee that any CMO will have adequate capacity for meeting all of our product needs, or be able to manufacture products for an adequate price. There is also no guarantee that any CMO will continue ongoing operations, causing potential delays in product supply, reduced revenues and other liabilities for us.\nThe equipment and facilities employed in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals are subject to stringent qualification requirements by regulatory agencies, including validation of equipment, systems and processes. We may be subject to lengthy delays and expense in conducting validation studies, if we can meet the requirements at all. Our manufacturing facility has not been inspected by regulatory agencies and there can be no assurance that it will be acceptable for licensure by regulatory authorities.\nIf we are unable to manufacture or contract for a sufficient supply of our product candidates on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our manufacturing processes or our relationships with other manufacturers, our preclinical and clinical testing schedule would be delayed. This in turn would delay the submission of product candidates for regulatory approval and thereby delay the market introduction and subsequent sales of any products that receive regulatory approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of our regulatory approval applications on a timely basis and must adhere to cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory bodies through their facilities inspection programs. If these facilities cannot pass a pre-approval plant inspection, the approval by the FDA or other regulatory bodies of the products will not be granted. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our facilities and processes for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to correct the issues or find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing of our products.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of a product candidate for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our manufacturing facility and our CMOs used for filling and finishing of our bulk product, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished product approved for commercial sale or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of any regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. The regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors or raw material suppliers. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Our third-party contractors or raw material suppliers may refuse to implement remedial measures required by regulatory authorities. Any failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations or failure to implement required remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on relationships with third-party CMOs, which limits our ability to control the availability of, and manufacturing costs for, our product candidates.\nProblems with any of our CMOs\u2019 or raw material suppliers\u2019 facilities or processes, could prevent or delay the production of adequate supplies of finished Tarmogens. This could delay clinical trials or delay and reduce commercial sales and materially harm our business. Any prolonged delay or interruption in the operations of our collaborators\u2019 facilities or CMOs\u2019 facilities could result in cancellation of shipments, loss of components in the process of being manufactured or a shortfall in availability of a product candidate or products. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability of a supplier to provide raw materials;\n\u00b7\nequipment malfunctions or failures at the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nhigh process failure rates;\n\u00b7\ndamage to facilities due to natural or man-made disasters;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our or our collaborators\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\naction by regulatory authorities or by us that results in the halting or slowdown of production of components or finished product at our facilities or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nproblems that delay or prevent manufacturing technology transfer to another facility, contract manufacturer or collaborator with subsequent delay or inability to start up a commercial facility;\n\u00b7\na contract manufacturer or supplier going out of business, undergoing a capacity shortfall or otherwise failing to produce product as contractually required;\n\u00b7\nemployee or contractor misconduct or negligence;\n\u00b7\nshipping delays, losses or interruptions; and\n\u00b7\nother similar factors.\nBecause manufacturing processes are complex and are subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity and sufficiently trained or qualified personnel may not be available on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all. Difficulties or delays in our CMOs\u2019 production of drug substances could delay our clinical trials, increase our costs, damage our reputation and cause us to lose revenue and market share if we are unable to timely meet market demand for any products that are approved for sale.\nThe manufacturing process for our Tarmogen product candidates has several components that are sourced from a single manufacturer. If we utilize an alternative manufacturer or alternative component, we may be required to demonstrate comparability of the drug product before releasing the product for clinical use and we may not be to find an alternative supplier. For example, the stoppers used to seal the vials of our products are made by a single supplier using a proprietary formula and process. Any change to the stopper would require us to carry out lengthy studies to verify that our product remains stable with the replacement stopper. The loss of any of our current suppliers could result in manufacturing delays for the component substitution, and we may need to accept changes in terms or price from our existing supplier in order to avoid such delays.\nFurther, if our CMOs are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post-marketing approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nWe use and generate hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nOur research, development and manufacturing involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, various active microorganisms and volatile organic compounds, and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with numerous laws and regulations. For example, as a pharmacologically-active material, any residual Tarmogen in process-waste streams must be disposed of as hazardous waste. We are subject to laws and regulations enforced by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, foreign health authorities and other regulatory requirements, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of our products, materials used to develop and manufacture our product candidates, and resulting waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials, and for killing any unused microorganisms before disposing of them, comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nWe replicate all yeast cells for our products internally and utilize a single manufacturing site to manufacture our clinical product candidates. Any disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing and would result in increased costs and losses.\nWe grow all yeast cells for our products internally using a complex process. Any disruption of our operations could result in manufacturing delays due to the inability to purchase the cell lines from outside sources. We have only one manufacturing facility in which we can manufacture clinical products. In the event of a physical catastrophe at our manufacturing or laboratory facilities, we could experience costly delays in reestablishing manufacturing capacity due to a lack of redundancy in manufacturing capability.\nConsistent manufacture of our products relies on maintenance of a master yeast bank, or MYB, as an essential starting material for all production. We currently store our MYB in ultra-low temperature freezers at two geographically distinct locations. We may discover storage stability problems that prevent use of the MYB. We may also suffer catastrophic events at the two storage locations that would destroy all available stocks of the MYB. Should we lose the MYB of any of our products we would experience significant delays in producing, characterizing, and gaining regulatory approval to use a replacement MYB. We may not be able to replicate the original MYB with sufficient fidelity to assure regulatory authorities that we are able to produce a comparable product, which could require us to perform clinical trials to gain approval of product made with the replacement MYB. This could result in a lengthy period in which we are unable to manufacture product candidates for clinical trials or, if any of our product candidates are approved, for sale.\nOur manufacturing facility contains specialized equipment and utilizes complicated production processes developed over a number of years, which would be difficult, time-consuming and costly to replace. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture products for clinical testing on our own and would cause us to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs. We may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or any losses may be excluded under our insurance policies. Certain events, such as natural disasters, fire, political disturbances, sabotage or business accidents, which could impact our current or future facilities, could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product development efforts until such time as we are able to repair our facility or put in place third-party CMOs to assume this manufacturing role.\nDuring the course of the product life cycle we will make process changes to scale up manufacturing to commercial manufacture or transfer the production to alternate sites or CMOs. Our ability to successfully implement these changes will depend on our ability to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory agencies that the product made by the new process or at the new site is comparable to the original product.\nIn the event that manufacturing process changes are necessary for the further development of a product candidate, we may not be able to reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for demonstrating comparability to the original product, which would require us to repeat clinical studies performed with the original product. This could result in lengthy delays in implementing the new process or site and substantial lost sales as a result of our inability to meet commercial demand. If we reach agreement with regulatory agencies on the criteria for establishing comparability, we may not be able to meet these criteria or may suffer lengthy delays in meeting these criteria. This may result in significant lost sales due to inability to meet commercial demand with the original product. Furthermore, studies to demonstrate comparability, or any other studies on the new process or site such as validation studies, may uncover findings that result in regulatory agencies delaying or refusing to approve the new process or site.\nRISKS RELATING TO REGULATION OF OUR INDUSTRY\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight in the United States, in addition to approval of products for sale and marketing.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of biopharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.\nThe federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal anti-kickback statute. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRISKS RELATING TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS\nWe compete in an industry characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological progress. New discoveries or commercial developments by our competitors could render our potential products obsolete or non-competitive.\nNew developments occur and are expected to continue to occur at a rapid pace in our industry, and there can be no assurance that discoveries or commercial developments by our competitors will not render some or all of our potential products obsolete or non-competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to compete with fully integrated and well-established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the near- and long-term. Most of these companies have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Such companies may succeed in discovering and developing pharmaceutical products more rapidly than we do or pharmaceutical products that are safer, more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. Such companies also may be more successful than we are in manufacturing, sales and marketing. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct clinical trials, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the development of product candidates.\nWe expect competition among products will be based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price and patent position. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop safer and more effective products, commercialize products earlier or more effectively than we do, or obtain patent protection or intellectual property rights that limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nThere can be no assurance that our issued patents or pending patent applications, if issued, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with proprietary protection or a competitive advantage.\nOur competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or reach the market sooner than our product candidates, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of products for cancer and infectious disease. Given the significant unmet patient need for new therapies, oncology is an area of focus for large and small companies as well as research institutions. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new oncology products. In addition, there are a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same cancer indications as our product candidates, and several large public biopharmaceutical companies have approved or are developing cancer immunotherapy products.\nThere are several immuno-oncology products approved for use by the FDA. The first to be FDA-approved was Dendreon Corporation\u2019s sipuleucel-T, an active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer. In addition, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company has two immunomodulatory products, ipilimumab and nivolumab that are FDA-approved for the treatment of certain melanomas. Nivolumab was also approved for the treatment of advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Merck also has an immunomodulatory drug, pembrolizumab, which has been FDA-approved for the treatment of certain melanomas. Additionally, several public and private biopharmaceutical companies have cancer immunotherapy product candidates in the late stage of development, including Dendreon Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., NewLink Genetics Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Kite Pharma, bluebird bio, Bellicium Pharmaceuticals, Merck KGaA and Sanofi. Further, both large public and smaller private biopharmaceutical companies have competing immunotherapy programs for the treatment of chronic infection include Gilead, LG LifeSciences, Arrowhead Research Corporation, Replicor, Heptara/Myr GmbH, Novira, Isis, GlaxoSmithKline, Romark Laboratories, Tetralogic, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, AiCuris, Agenix, Tekmira, Transgene S.A., Alnylam, Assembly Biosciences and Emergent BioSolutions Inc.\nThere are several marketed products indicated for pancreas cancer, including Astellas Pharma Inc.\u2019s erlotinib, Celgene Corporation\u2019s protein bound paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited\u2019s streptozocin, and gemcitabine, fluorouracil, or 5-FU, and mitomycin that are marketed by several generic pharmaceutical firms. In addition, there are multiple companies or institutions conducting active clinical trials of immunotherapy products in pancreas cancer including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co., Bavarian Nordic, NewLink Genetics Corporation, Aduro BioTech Inc., Advantagene, Inc. AlphaVax, Inc., Duke University, Fukushima Medical University, NCI, Providence Health & Services, University of Pennsylvania, and Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nThere are numerous marketed therapeutics indicated for NSCLC, including Roche Holding AG\u2019s bevacizumab, Eli Lilly\u2019s pemetrexed, Astellas Pharma\u2019s erlotinib, AstraZeneca PLC\u2019s gefitinib, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s nivolumab, as well as generically available gemcitabine, platinum-based chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) and mitotic inhibitors (paclitaxel and vinorelbine), which are marketed by several generic pharmaceutical firms. In addition, there are multiple companies or institutions with active clinical trials of immunotherapy products in late stage lung cancer, including Merck & Co., Bioven Sdn., Heat Biologics, New Link Genetics, NIH/NCI, Kael-GemVax Co., Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Oslo University, University of Pittsburgh, Recombio SL, Shiga University, Transgene SA, UbiVac, and Vaxn Biotech.\nThere are numerous marketed therapeutics indicated for colorectal cancer, including Roche Holding AG\u2019s bevacizumab, Bristol Myers-Squibb\u2019s cetuximab, Amgen\u2019s panitumumab, as well as irinotecan, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU, which are marketed by several generic pharmaceutical firms. In addition, there are multiple companies or institutions with active clinical trials of immunotherapy products in colorectal cancer including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co., Biothera, AlphaVax Inc., Duke University, Immunovative Therapies Ltd., University of Michigan Cancer Center, Instituto Cientifico y Tecnological de Navara, NCI, Radboud University, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and Stanford University.\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vandetanib and Exelixis\u2019 cabozantinib are FDA approved for late-stage, or metastatic, MTC in adult patients who are ineligible for resection. Further, there are several companies or institutions with clinical trials of immunotherapy products generally targeting carcinoembryonic antigen, or CEA, including Bavarian Nordic, Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Radboud University and NCI.\nThere are several marketed therapeutics indicated for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, including Roche Holding AG\u2019s pegylated interferon 2a, Gilead\u2019s tenofovir and adefovir, Bristol Myers-Squibb\u2019s entecavir, Novartis\u2019 telbivudine, and lamivudine, which is marketed by several generic pharmaceutical firms. In addition, there are several companies or institutions with clinical trials of competing immunotherapy products for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, including but not limited to Gilead, LG LifeSciences, Arrowhead Research Corporation, Replicor, Heptara/Myr GmbH, Novira, Isis, GlaxoSmithKline, Romark Laboratories, Tetralogic, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, AiCuris, Agenix, Tekmira, Transgene S.A., Alnylam, Assembly Biosciences and Emergent BioSolutions.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the significant expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nThere are many different approaches to using immunotherapies to treat cancer, including anti-idiotype, whole cell, DNA, peptide/antigen, viral, tumor lysate, immune check-point inhibitors, shed antigens, and modified dendritic cells. Cancer immunotherapies are also distinguished by whether or not they are derived from autologous or allogeneic sources. Each of the various approaches to cancer immunotherapy has potential advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as its immunostimulatory mechanisms, formulation characteristics and manufacturing requirements.\nWe also compete with other clinical-stage companies and institutions for clinical trial participants, which could reduce our ability to recruit participants for our clinical trials. Delay in recruiting clinical trial participants could adversely affect our ability to bring a product to market prior to our competitors. Further, research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render our product candidates obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue.\nIn addition, our competitors may obtain patent protection or FDA approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. If the FDA approves the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have limited or no experience. We expect competition among products will be based on product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, product price, reimbursement coverage by government and private third-party payors, and patent position. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our products receive regulatory approval, but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and commercialized, we may face competition from biosimilars. The route to market for biosimilars was established with the passage of the ACA in March 2010, providing 12 years of marketing exclusivity for reference products and an additional six months of exclusivity if pediatric studies are conducted. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency has issued guidelines for approving products through an abbreviated pathway, and biosimilars have been approved in Europe. If a biosimilar version of one of our potential products were approved in the United States or Europe, it could have a negative effect on sales and gross profits of the potential product and our financial condition.\nEven if we achieve market acceptance for our products, we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our drugs because of generic and biosimilar competition and social pressure to lower the cost of drugs.\nSeveral of the FDA approved products for HBV face patent expiration in the next several years. As a result, generic versions and biosimilars of these drugs and biologicals may become available. We expect to face competition from these products, including price-based competition. Pressure from government and private reimbursement groups, plus patient awareness and other social activist groups to reduce drug prices may also put downward pressure on the prices of drugs, including our product candidates, if they are commercialized. Also, if a biosimilar to any of our product candidates is approved by regulatory agencies, there will be significant pricing pressure on our products, causing us or our collaborators to reduce the sales price of our products.\nOur product candidates may not be accepted in the marketplace; therefore, we may not be able to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven if our Tarmogen product candidates are approved for sale, physicians and the medical community may not ultimately use them or may use them only in applications more restricted than we expect. Our product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with a number of traditional products and immunotherapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies. Our product candidates will also compete with new products currently under development by such companies and others. Physicians will prescribe a product only if they determine, based on experience, clinical data, side effect profiles, reimbursement for their patients and other factors, that it is beneficial as compared to other products currently in use. Many other factors influence the adoption of new products, including marketing and distribution restrictions, course of treatment, adverse publicity, product pricing, the views of thought leaders in the medical community and reimbursement by government and private third-party payors.\nFor our products that are developed in combination with other therapies, changes in standard of care or use patterns could make those combinations obsolete. For example, we are developing GI-4000 for pancreas cancer in combination with gemcitabine. If GI-4000 is approved for marketing in combination with gemcitabine and use of another therapy becomes more prevalent than gemcitabine, sales of the combination of GI-4000 with gemcitabine could be negatively impacted and our financial results and the value of our securities would be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and some of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or we may be delayed in doing so.\nWe often rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our non-clinical studies and clinical trials. For example, the NCI is conducting clinical trials for GI-6207 and GI-6301 and we are supporting the investigator-initiated GI-4000-03 clinical trial in NSCLC at MSKCC. We are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA requires us to comply with Good Laboratory Practice for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, to ensure that data and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with GCP, do not adhere to our clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be more costly than expected or budgeted, extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nFurther, if our CMOs are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post-marketing approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nWe may explore strategic collaborations that may never materialize or may fail.\nWe may, in the future, periodically explore a variety of possible strategic collaborations in an effort to gain access to additional product candidates or resources. At the current time, we cannot predict what form such a strategic collaboration might take. We are likely to face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and these strategic collaborations can be complicated and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional strategic collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic collaborations.\nRISKS RELATING TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and maintain trade secrets, both in the United States and other countries. Patent matters in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, the validity, breadth and enforceability of our patents and the existence of potentially blocking patent rights of others cannot be predicted, either in the United States or in other countries.\nThere can be no assurance that we will discover or develop patentable products or processes or that patents will issue from any of the currently pending patent applications or that claims granted on issued patents will be sufficient to protect our technology or adequately cover the actual products we may actually sell. Potential competitors or other researchers in the field may have filed patent applications, been issued patents, published articles or otherwise created prior art that could restrict or block our efforts to obtain additional patents. There also can be no assurance that our issued patents or pending patent applications, if issued, will not be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented or that the rights granted hereunder will provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. Our patent rights also depend on our compliance with technology and patent licenses upon which our patent rights are based and upon the validity of assignments of patent rights from consultants and other inventors that were, or are, not employed by us.\nIn addition, competitors may manufacture and sell our potential products in those foreign countries where we have not filed for patent protection or where patent protection may be unavailable, not obtainable or ultimately not enforceable. In addition, even where patent protection is obtained, third-party competitors may challenge our patent claims in the various patent offices, for example via opposition in the European Patent Office or reexamination, interpartes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. The ability of such competitors to sell such products in the United States or in foreign countries where we have obtained patents is usually governed by the patent laws of the countries in which the product is sold.\nWe will incur significant ongoing expenses in maintaining our patent portfolio. Should we lack the funds to maintain our patent portfolio or to enforce our rights against infringers, we could be adversely impacted. Even if claims of infringement are without merit, any such action could divert the time and attention of management and impair our ability to access additional capital and/or cost us significant funds to defend.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe or our licensors or strategic collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u00b7\nIssued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u00b7\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u00b7\nThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have only become effective within the last two years. Accordingly, it is yet not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business, our current and pending patent portfolio and future intellectual property strategy. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur success also will depend, in part, on our refraining from infringing patents or otherwise violating intellectual property owned or controlled by others. Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities, research institutions and others may have filed patent applications or have received, or may obtain, issued patents in the United States or elsewhere relating to aspects of our technology. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patents will require us to alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Some third-party applications or patents may conflict with our issued patents or pending applications. Any such conflict could result in a significant reduction of the scope or value of our issued or licensed patents.\nIn addition, if patents issued to other companies contain blocking, dominating or conflicting claims and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology and cease practicing those activities, including potentially manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe those patents. If any licenses are required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all, and if these licenses are not obtained, we might be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of certain of our potential products. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our products on favorable terms may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation, which could result in substantial costs to us (even if determined in our favor), may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The FDA has published draft guidance documents for implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or the BPCIA, under the ACA, related to the development of follow-on biologics (biosimilars), although detailed guidance for patent litigation procedures under this act has not yet been provided.\nIf another company files for approval to market a competing follow-on biologic, and/or if such approval is given to such a company, we may be required to promptly initiate patent litigation to prevent the marketing of such biosimilar version of our product prior to the normal expiration of the patent. There can be no assurance that our issued or licensed patents would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction or that any follow-on biologic would be found to infringe our patents.\nIn addition, if our competitors file or have filed patent applications in the United States that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention. These proceedings, if initiated by the USPTO, could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Such proceedings can be lengthy, are costly to defend and involve complex questions of law and fact, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant review proceedings or third-party ex parte reexamination or inter partes review proceedings under the USPTO. An adverse outcome with respect to a third-party claim or in an interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to license disputed rights from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology, especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable or where patents have not issued. For example, our manufacturing process involves a number of trade secret steps, processes, and conditions. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, with confidentiality agreements and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with our consultants and certain contractors. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. We may fail in certain circumstances to obtain the necessary confidentiality agreements, or their scope or term may not be sufficiently broad to protect our interests.\nIf our trade secrets or other intellectual property become known to our competitors, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates is dependent or may be dependent in the future on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents or product-specific patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. This is the case with our license of patents related to CEA from the National Institutes of Health. In addition, our licensors and/or licensees may have back-up rights to prosecute patent applications in the event that we do not do so or choose not to do so, and our licensees may have the right to assume patent prosecution rights after certain milestones are reached. If any of our licensing collaborators fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR EXPOSURE TO LITIGATION\nWe are exposed to potential product liability or similar claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Clinical trials involve the testing of product candidates on human subjects or volunteers under a research plan, and carry a risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients due to unforeseen adverse side effects, improper administration of the product candidate, or other factors. Many of these patients are already seriously ill and are therefore particularly vulnerable to further illness or death.\nWe currently carry clinical trial liability insurance in the amount of $5 million in the aggregate, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance or that the amount of such insurance will be adequate to cover claims. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim outside the scope of indemnity or insurance coverage, if the indemnity is not performed or enforced in accordance with its terms, or if our liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or that if obtained, the insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities. Similar risks would exist upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or our collaborators.\nRegardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our product;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;\n\u00b7\ncosts of litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management; and\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.\nShould any of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to the Company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and executive officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify other officers, employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and executive officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or executive officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors, (iii) such indemnification is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws.\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nWe may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nAs a result, if we are required to indemnify one or more of our directors or executive officers, it may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us, may reduce the amount of money available to us and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nOur common stock has experienced wide fluctuations, and may continue to experience wide fluctuations, in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the following:\n\u00b7\nnew products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors or our collaborators, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated results from and any delays in our clinical trials as well as results of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nvariations in the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs, including relating to the timing of invoices from, and other billing practices of, our CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the status of our relationships with Celgene, Gilead, NCI and other collaborators;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nactual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nfinancial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u00b7\ndeviations from securities analysts\u2019 estimates or the impact of other analyst ratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to these events;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles or accounting judgments;\n\u00b7\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future and our stockholders may never obtain a return on their investment.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our securities to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our securities in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our securities. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their securities after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our securities.\nOur security holders may be diluted by future issuances of securities by us.\nWe may issue additional securities or security units convertible into or exchangeable for our securities. The issuance of additional securities or security units convertible into or exchangeable for our securities would dilute the ownership of us by existing investors and could adversely affect the value of our securities. In addition, we may issue securities in the future with rights senior to the rights of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We will need to hire additional employees in the future or engage outside consultants to help us comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls due to the fact that we only have one employee in our accounting and finance department. As a result, we were unable to allow for proper segregation of duties and reviews of transactions prior to being entered into our books and records.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure create uncertainty for public companies, increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from our business activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nBeing a public company and the associated public company rules and regulations make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results would be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe will be required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We will also be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. Eventually, after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we may be required to obtain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls due to the fact that we only have one employee in our accounting and finance department. As a result, we were unable to allow for proper segregation of duties and reviews of transactions prior to being entered into our books and records. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or, if when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nAs an emerging growth company, we are subject to reduced reporting obligations and eligible for various exemptions from public reporting obligations which may reduce demand for our common stock.\nFor as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our public filings, periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any date before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or if our annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion, we would cease to be an emerging growth company on the last day of the year in which that occurs. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on the exemptions from certain reporting standards as an emerging growth company. If some investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile or decline.\nNew accounting pronouncements may impact our reported results of operations and financial position.\nThe JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we chose to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new pronouncements or the application of existing pronouncements to changes in our business could significantly alter our reported financial statements and results of operations.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change-of-control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change-of-control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors or amend our bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change-of-control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person that together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of the Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes is limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nSubject to certain limitations, a corporation may offset a net operating loss carryforward against profit earned in a future year to determine its U.S. federal income tax expenses for such year. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 limit a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes (including research credits) to offset future federal taxable income or tax if, in general, the corporation experiences a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over any rolling three year period. State net operating loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) may be similarly limited. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a current state tax liability of $115,765 due to statutory limitations in the use of state net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change can therefore result in significantly greater tax liabilities than a corporation would incur in the absence of such a change and any increased liabilities could adversely affect the corporation\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had available total federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $116.2 million, which expire in the years 2022 through 2034, and federal research credit carryforwards of $7.0 million, which expire in the years 2022 through 2034. Based on an analysis from our inception through December 31, 2013, we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in June 2003 and August 2007. These two ownership changes limit our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) in future years. We have not completed our analysis of any potential Section 382 ownership changes for the year ended December 31, 2014, but we anticipate that such an ownership change may have occurred in July 2014 upon the closing of our IPO which we believe will limit our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards (and certain other tax attributes) that accrued prior to the IPO.\nAdditional ownership changes may occur in the future as a result of additional equity offerings or events over which we will have little or no control, including purchases and sales of our equity by our five-percent security holders, the emergence of new five-percent security holders, redemptions of our securities or certain changes in the ownership of any of our five percent security holders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, or publishes unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14801, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GBIM"}
