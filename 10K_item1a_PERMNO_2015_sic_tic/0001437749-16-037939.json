{"cik": "736822", "company": "IMMUCOR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. - Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect us. We provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business, which we believe are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, or could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nLower blood demand could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur transfusion diagnostics products are used to test blood prior to transfusion. Lower demand for blood in the markets in which we operate could result in lower testing volumes. For example, we believe the U.S. market has been experiencing lower demand for blood in our last six fiscal years. Lower blood demand could result from a variety of factors, such as fewer elective surgeries and more efficient blood utilization by hospitals. Blood is a large expense for hospital laboratories and pressure on hospital budgets due to macroeconomic factors and healthcare reform could force changes in the ways in which blood is used. Lower blood demand could negatively impact our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nA catastrophic event at any of our manufacturing facilities would prevent us from producing many of our reagent products.\nSubstantially all of our diagnostic products are produced at single-sites. While we have reliable supplies of most raw materials, our reagent production is highly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of each facility, and we currently have no plans to develop a third-party reagent manufacturing capability as an alternative source of supply. Therefore, if a catastrophic event occurred at any of our facilities, such as a fire or tornado, many of those products could not be produced until the manufacturing portion of the facility was restored and cleared by the FDA. We maintain a disaster recovery plan to minimize the effects of such a catastrophe, and we have obtained insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses. However, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may not be successful in capitalizing on our acquisitions.\nAcquisitions could cause diversion of management\u2019s time as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration or inadequate management resources available for oversight as well as integration activities. We may face difficulties and inefficiencies in managing and operating businesses in multiple locations or operating businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience today.\nThe long-term success of our acquisitions and any additional acquisitions we may complete in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully grow the acquired businesses as well as realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquired businesses with our business. We may fail to grow these businesses or realize the expected synergies or anticipated growth targets from acquisitions. In addition, it may take longer than expected to achieve those synergies and growth targets. Acquisitions may cause other unexpected costs or liabilities and our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions could harm our business and prospects.\nOur business may be harmed by the contingent earn-out obligations in connection with acquisitions.\nIn connection with some of our acquisitions, we incur obligations to make contingent earn-out payments if certain financial and product development targets of certain acquired businesses are met over specified periods. Contractual provisions relating to the contingent earn-out obligation include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us. These provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the earn-out obligation amount due as well as the operation of the acquired businesses. Such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources. We can give no assurance that our contingent obligations, including the associated covenants relating to the operation of the acquired businesses, will not otherwise adversely affect our business, liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.\nUnforeseen product performance problems could prevent us from selling or result in a recall of the affected products.\nIn the event that we experience a product performance problem with either our instruments or our reagents, we may be required to, or may voluntarily, recall or suspend selling the products until the problem is resolved. We have from time to time initiated voluntary recalls of our products. Depending on the product, as well as the availability of acceptable substitutes, such a product recall or suspension could significantly impact our operating results.\nProduct performance could increase operating costs and result in the loss of current or future customers.\nProduct performance and reliability is a key factor in satisfying current customers and attracting new customers. Poor performance or unreliability of our products would not only increase maintenance costs, in the case of our instruments, but also could result in losing important current customers and an inability to gain new customers which could adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause we sell our U.S. manufactured products internationally, we could be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, revenue outside the U.S. was approximately 37% of total revenue. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar could make our products less competitive and affect our revenue and earnings levels for our international affiliates. An increase in our revenue outside the U.S. would increase this exposure. We have not historically hedged against currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nGross margin volatility may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur gross margin may be volatile from period to period due to various factors, including instrument sales, product mix, geographic mix, and manufacturing costs. As we continue to drive automation in the blood bank marketplace, we may experience increased instrument sales. The probable sales mix (in terms of instrument/reagent sales) could make it difficult for us to sustain the overall gross margins we have generated in the past. The higher margins on the reagents used on our instruments may not be enough to offset the lower margins on the instruments themselves. For our products, margins vary depending upon the type of product. Additionally, market pricing for our products varies by geographic region. Depending upon the product and geographic sales mix, margins could vary significantly from period to period. Our reagent products are manufactured in-house. Margins for these products could be impacted based upon costs of raw materials and labor as well as overhead and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations from period to period. Margins may also be negatively impacted by increased competition. New market entrants or existing market participants seeking to gain market share may foster a competitive environment of pricing pressures and/or increased marketing and other expenditures that could negatively impact profitability.\nIf customers delay integrating our instruments into their operations, the growth of our business could be negatively impacted.\nFrom time to time in the past, some of our customers have experienced significant delays between the purchase of an instrument and the time at which it has been successfully integrated into the customer\u2019s existing operations and is generating reagent revenue at its expected annualized run rate. These delays may be due to a number of factors, including staffing and training issues and difficulties interfacing our instruments with the customer\u2019s computer systems. Because our business operates on a \u201crazor/razor blade\u201d model, such integration delays result in delayed purchases of the reagents used with the instrument. Delays of customers successfully integrating instruments into their operations could adversely impact our future revenues, earnings and cash flow.\nWe may not be successful in capitalizing on acquisitions of former distributors or newly established distribution networks outside the U.S.\nAn integral part of our strategy is to sell our products in additional markets outside North America. To further this strategy, in the past we have either acquired third party distribution businesses or have established our own direct distribution organizations. Our ability to grow successfully in overseas markets depends in part on our ability to achieve product acceptance and customer loyalty in these markets. Additionally, our operations in foreign countries present certain challenges and are subject to certain risks not necessarily present in our domestic operations, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays, changes in applicable laws and regulations and various restrictions on trade. These factors could impact our ability to compete successfully in these markets, which could in turn negatively affect our international expansion goals, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur financial performance is dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new products and services.\nOur financial performance depends in part upon our ability to successfully develop and market next generation automated instruments and other products in a rapidly changing technological and economic environment. Our market share and operating results would be adversely affected if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, or if new products or technology are introduced in the market by competitors that could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, delays in the introduction of new products due to regulatory, developmental, or other obstacles could negatively impact our revenue, earnings and market share.\nIndustry adoption of alternative technology could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully.\nOur products are used to test antibodies and DNA to determine a match prior to a transfusion or a transplant as well as for post-transplant monitoring to aid in the determination of graft rejection. Various advances in the treatment and monitoring of patients could cause lower demand for testing with our products. Additionally, customers could adopt alternative technologies for testing, instead of our technology, which could result in lower demand for our products.\nWe may need to develop new technologies for our products to remain competitive. We may have problems in the process of developing and delivering new products to the market, which could cause our financial performance to be negatively impacted.\nGlobal economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our results.\nWe are a global company with customers around the world. General economic conditions impact our customers, particularly hospitals. For our instruments, reduced capital budgets that result from negative economic conditions, such as a global recession, could result in lower instrument sales, which would negatively impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flow. Additionally, global economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers to access funds to enable them to fund their operating and capital budgets. Budget constraints could slow our progress in driving automation in both our customer base and the blood banking industry as a whole, as well as the adoption of new products, which could negatively impact our future revenues, profitability and cash flow.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and staff, including sales, technical and management personnel, many of whom have very specialized industry and technical expertise that is not easily replaced. If key individuals leave us, we could be adversely affected if suitable replacement personnel are not quickly recruited. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. For example, there is intense competition for medical technologists, and in some markets there is a shortage of qualified personnel in our industry. If we are unable to continue to attract or retain highly qualified personnel, the development, growth and future success of our business could be adversely affected.\nSupply chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nSupply chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. The supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of poor vendor performance or other events outside our control, which may require us, among other things, to identify alternate vendors and could result in lost sales and increased expenses. While such interruption could impact any of our third-party sourced materials, three particular areas of note are our transfusion diagnostic instrument suppliers, our supply sources for rare antibodies or antigen combinations and our supply of raw materials from Luminex, which are described below.\nWe purchase our transfusion diagnostic instruments from single-source suppliers. If the supply of any of our instruments were interrupted, due to the supplier\u2019s financial problems or otherwise, we believe an alternative supplier could be found but that it would take in the range of 18 months to 24 months to transfer the technology and begin production with a new instrument supplier. The disruption of one of these supply relationships could cause us to incur costs associated with the development of an alternative source. Also, we may be required to obtain FDA clearance of the instrument if it is not built to the same specifications as with the previous supplier. The process of changing an instrument supplier could have an adverse impact on future growth opportunities during the transition period if supplies of instruments on hand were insufficient to satisfy demand.\nSome of our reagent products are derived from blood having particular or rare combinations of antibodies or antigens, which are found in a limited number of individuals. If we had difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of such blood and the supply was interrupted, we would need to establish a viable alternative, which may take both time and expense to either identify and/or develop and could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial position.\nLuminex is our technology partner for our HLA products and we secure certain raw materials from Luminex to manufacture our HLA reagents. A disruption in supply of these raw materials could cause us to not be able to supply products to our customers. Additionally, a long-term disruption of supply from Luminex could result in us having to develop an alternate technology platform on which to deliver our HLA products, which could be both costly and result in a loss of revenue until a new product was brought to market.\nInterruptions in our production capabilities could increase our production costs or reduce sales.\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment for which there may be only limited or no production alternatives and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We may experience periods of reduced production as a result of these types of equipment failures, which could cause us to lose or prevent us from taking advantage of various business opportunities or prevent us from responding to competitive pressures.\nClosure of our facility in Stamford, CT could negatively impact our production capabilities of its products at another location.\nWe may face unexpected risks related to the closure of our facility in Stamford, Connecticut. We may not be able to transfer the manufacture of certain products to other facilities without interruptions in supply or difficulties in maintaining the quality of our products. We may have difficulty hiring or retaining the appropriate personnel for the manufacture of Stamford products at another location. We are following a plan for the facility closure to mitigate these risks, but we will not be able to eliminate all the risks related to moving the manufacturing location of some of our products.\nDistribution chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nDistribution chain interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance. Our international affiliates get almost all of their reagent products from our U.S. manufacturing facilities. If circumstances arose that disrupted our distribution of U.S.-sourced products internationally, we would need to establish an alternate distribution channel, which may take both time and expense to establish and could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial position.\nOur molecular diagnostics products may not gain wide commercial acceptance.\nBioArray\u2019s molecular diagnostics products continue to gain commercial traction. In May 2014, the FDA approved our PreciseTypeTM HEA test, and in July 2015, Medicare approved coverage for our product for pretransfusion molecular testing for four designated types of use in the Medicare Administrative Contractor jurisdiction which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and most counties within Virginia. Since then, we have positive payment coverages for approximately 77% of potential Medicare-covered lives. Additionally, we have coverage in a number of states for Medicaid and are expanding coverage among private payers. However, even with regulatory approval, these products are new to the marketplace and we will have to develop the nascent market for these products over time. Our molecular transfusion diagnostic business is also subject to risks associated with reimbursement, cannibalization of a portion of our existing serology business and the same macroeconomic factors, such as lower blood demand, that our serology business faces.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology.\nWe have a substantial patent portfolio of issued patents or pending patent applications supporting our molecular immunohematology offering. We also have patents supporting our transfusion and coagulation products. Our competitiveness depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. Because the law is constantly changing, and unforeseen facts may arise, there is always a risk that patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable. Therefore, there is no absolute certainty as to the exact scope of protection associated with any intellectual property. We believe our patents, together with our trade secrets and know-how, will prevent any current or future competitors from successfully copying and distributing our products. However, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop around the patented aspects of any of our current or proposed products or independently develop technology or know-how that is equivalent to or competitive with our technology and know-how. Any damage to our intellectual property portfolio could result in an adverse effect on our current or proposed products, our revenues and our operations.\nProtecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. We may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third-party claims, which would be expensive and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights infringement claims in the future, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay substantial damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, not only on protecting our own intellectual property but on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Were third parties to claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Our practices, products and technologies, particularly with respect to the field of molecular immunohematology, may not be able to withstand third-party claims, regardless of the merits of such claims.\nAs a result of such potential intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide it is appropriate to discontinue manufacturing, using, or selling particular products subject to infringement claims or develop other technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible. In addition, to the extent potential claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue certain of our practices, products or technologies that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We also may have to seek third-party licenses to continue certain of our existing or planned product lines, thereby incurring substantial costs related to royalty payments for such licenses, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Also, license agreements can be terminated under appropriate circumstances. No assurance can be given that efforts to remediate any infringement would be successful or that licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.\nIn the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products, or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party and we fail to license such technology on acceptable terms and conditions or to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe upgrade of our business information system could pose a risk to our ability to effectively operate and manage our business.\nIn an effort to streamline our processes and gain efficiencies, the Company made the decision to reduce the number of business information systems we operate. We are currently in the process of migrating our existing businesses to a single business information system. The business information system is also being upgraded to the next generation application. The introduction of a new business information system or upgrading existing systems poses multiple risks. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry, and regulatory standards. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could have operational disruptions which could result in inaccurate or untimely reporting of financial and operational results, an inability to effectively manage the ongoing operations of the business, adversely affect our ability to adequately service the needs of our existing customer\u2019s or attract new customers, or suffer other damaging consequences. We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nRisks relating to our industry\nGovernment regulation may delay or prevent new product introduction and affect our ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products.\nOur instruments, reagents and other products are subject to regulation by governmental and private agencies in the U.S. and abroad, which regulate the testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, and marketing of medical supplies and devices. Certain international regulatory bodies also impose import and tax restrictions, tariff regulations, and duties on imported products. Delays in agency review can significantly delay new product introduction and may result in a product becoming \u201coutdated\u201d or losing its market opportunity before it can be introduced. Also, the FDA and international agencies have the authority to require a recall or modification of products in the event of a defect.\nFDA clearance or approval may be required before we can market new instruments or reagents in the U.S. or make significant changes to existing products. The process of obtaining marketing clearances and approvals from regulatory agencies for new products can be time consuming and expensive. There is no assurance that clearances or approvals will be granted or that agency review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nOther governmental regulations may require the redesign and clearance of our products before they can be available in the marketplace. For example, our instruments are subject to \u201cThe Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and Electronic Equipment\u201d (RoHS), which implements European Union Directive 2002/95, and restricts the level of certain hazardous substances, including lead and mercury, in the sale of new electrical and electronic equipment in the EU.\nIf any of our products failed to perform in the manner represented during this clearance or approval process, particularly concerning safety issues, one or more of these agencies could require us to cease manufacturing and selling that product, or even recall previously-placed products, and to resubmit the product for clearance or approval before we could sell it again. Depending on the product, and the availability of acceptable substitutes, such an agency action could result in significantly reduced revenues and earnings for an indefinite period.\nFederal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that regulation of our products will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.\nThe sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities. Our new Immucor DX business introduces new compliance obligations for our business that may not be familiar to our employees. The Immucor DX lab causes us to have greater exposure to risks related to federal reimbursement compliance, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), Stark law and other federal state and local regulations.\nU.S. and foreign governments have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and similar anti-bribery laws. We are expanding internationally into countries that have higher risk profiles for anti-bribery compliance. We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. However, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industry and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively with larger companies with greater financial resources than we have.\nOur industry and the markets we operate in are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, making them better equipped to fund research and development, manufacturing and marketing efforts, or license technologies and intellectual property from third parties. We also face risks related to customers finding alternative methods of testing, which could result in lower demand for our products. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. Although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining these advantages will require us to continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. Sufficient resources to continue to make such investments may not be available, or at such levels that would allow us to be successful in maintaining such advantages.\nIncreased competition in the U.S. could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nWe could face increased competition in the U.S. market, which historically has had a limited number of market participants. For fiscal year 2016, approximately 63% of our revenues were generated in the U.S., and our U.S. operations have higher gross margins than our operations outside the U.S. Additional competition in the U.S. could negatively impact our revenues and/or our profitability.\nChanges in government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in government policy could have a significant impact on our business by increasing the cost of doing business, affecting our ability to sell our products and negatively impacting our profitability. Such changes could include modifications to existing legislation, such as U.S. tax policy, or entirely new legislation.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims resulting from the use of products we sell and distribute.\nAlthough product liability claims in our industry are infrequent, the expansion of our business in an increasingly litigious business environment may expose us to product liability claims related to the products we sell. We maintain insurance that includes product liability coverage, and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate for our business. However, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage for these risks will continue to be available or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will continue to be available at a reasonable cost. A partially or completely uninsured successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. The major components of our debt consist of senior credit facilities (\u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d) and unsecured notes (\u201cNotes\u201d). Our Senior Credit Facilities, as amended, are comprised of: (a) senior secured revolving loan facilities (the \u201cRevolving Facilities\u201d) for $80.0 million which mature on the earlier of (i) February 2020, (ii) May 2018, if the maturity of the Term Loan Facility has not been extended by such date, and (iii) 90 days prior to any maturity date of certain funded material indebtedness (which maturity date shall be no earlier than October 19, 2019) and (b) a $641.8 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) which matures in August 2018. We have $400.0 million in aggregate principal of unsecured 11.125% Notes due in August 2019. As of May 31, 2016, total principal indebtedness outstanding was $1,041.8 million and we had unused commitments of $80.0 million under our Revolving Facilities. The Revolving Facilities includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit and borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swing line loans, in each case, up to $25.0 million, and is available in U.S. dollars, GBP, Euros, Yen, Canadian dollars and in such other currencies as the Company and the Administrative Agent under the Revolving Facilities may agree (subject to a sublimit for such non-U.S. currencies).\nSubject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Notes, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022\npreventing us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all the Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes and cause a cross-default under the Senior Credit Facilities.\nIn addition, the indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, many of which are foreign legal entities and are not guarantors of our debt. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the Notes and the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing the Notes and the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of May 31, 2016, our Senior Credit Facilities had unused revolving debt commitments of $80.0 million. All of those borrowings would be secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we face could intensify.\nThe terms of the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe indenture governing the Notes and the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Facilities portion of our Senior Credit Facilities require us to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio of less than 5.25 to 1.00 to be tested on the last day of each fiscal quarter. Our ability to meet this financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture governing the Notes or under the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our Senior Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming that the entire Revolving Facilities were fully drawn, each one-eighth point change in the LIBOR interest rate above the Term Loan Facility\u2019s LIBOR floor of 1.25% would result in a $0.9 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our Senior Credit Facilities. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.", "PERMNO": 88867, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "BLUD1"}
