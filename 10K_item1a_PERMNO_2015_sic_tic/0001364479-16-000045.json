RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. Any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow and we believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting our company; however, the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly impact us.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur car rental business, which provides the majority of our revenues, is particularly sensitive to reductions in the levels of airline passenger travel, and reductions in air travel could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur results of operations are affected by many economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. At times in the past, the United States and international markets have experienced declines in economic activity that have affected the car rental market, including a tightening of the credit markets, reduced business and leisure travel, reduced government and consumer spending and volatile fuel prices. The car rental industry is particularly affected by reductions in business and leisure travel, especially with respect to levels of airline passenger traffic. Reductions in levels of air travel, whether caused by general economic conditions, airfare increases (such as due to capacity reductions or increases in fuel costs borne by commercial airlines) or other events (such as work stoppages, military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural disasters, epidemic diseases, or the response of governments to any of these events) could materially adversely affect us. In particular, we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues from key leisure destinations, including Florida, Hawaii, California, New York and Texas and the level of travel to these destinations is dependent upon the ability and willingness of consumers to travel on vacation and the effect of economic cycles on consumers' discretionary travel. To the extent travel to these destinations is adversely affected, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We believe that price is one of the primary competitive factors in the car and equipment rental markets and that the internet has enabled cost-conscious customers, including business travelers, to more easily compare rates available from rental companies. If we try to increase our pricing, our competitors, some of whom may have greater resources and better access to capital than us, may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing. In addition, our competitors may reduce prices in order to attempt to gain a competitive advantage, capture market share, or to compensate for declines in rental activity. To the extent we do not match or remain within a reasonable competitive margin of our competitors\u2019 pricing, our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If competitive pressures lead us to match any of our competitors\u2019 downward pricing and we are not able to reduce our operating costs, then our margins, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-U.S. and International Car Rental Operations-Competition\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Business-Worldwide Equipment Rental-Competition\u2019\u2019 in this Annual Report.\nOur business is highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nCertain significant components of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, including minimum concession fees, real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs. Seasonal changes in our revenues do not alter those fixed expenses, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher. The second and third quarters of the year have historically been the strongest quarters for our car rental business due to increased levels of leisure travel and our equipment rental business, especially in the construction industry, has historically experienced decreased levels of business from December until late spring and heightened activity during our third and fourth quarter until December. Any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during these periods could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf our management is unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and adjust the size and mix of our fleet accordingly, our results of operations could suffer.\nBecause fleet costs typically represent our single largest expense and fleet purchases are typically made weeks or months in advance of the expected use of the fleet, our business is dependent upon the ability of our management to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and consumer preferences with respect to the mix of vehicles in our fleet. To the extent we do not purchase sufficient numbers of vehicles, or the right types of vehicles, to meet consumer demand, we may lose revenue to our competitors. If we purchase too many vehicles, our fleet utilization could be adversely affected and we may not be able to dispose of excess vehicles in a timely and cost effective manner. While\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\npurchasing program cars is useful in managing our seasonal peak demand for fleet, program cars typically cost more than non-program cars. As a result, if our management is unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and determine the appropriate mix of vehicles in our fleet, including because of changes in the competitive environment or economic factors outside of our control, our results of operations could suffer.\nIncreased fleet cost due to declines in the value of the non-program cars in our fleet could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 35% and 49%, respectively, of the vehicles purchased for our U.S. car rental fleet were program cars and 59% and 59%, respectively, of the vehicles purchased for our International car rental fleet were program cars.\nManufacturers agree to repurchase program cars at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the cars during a specified time period. To the extent the vehicles in our fleet are non-program cars, we have an increased risk that the market value of a car at the time of its disposition will be less than its estimated residual value at such time. Any decrease in residual values with respect to our non-program cars and equipment could also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe use of program cars enables us to determine our depreciation expense in advance and this is useful to us because depreciation is a significant cost factor in our operations. Using program cars is also useful in managing our seasonal peak demand for fleet, because in certain cases we can sell certain program cars shortly after having acquired them at a higher value than what we could for a similar non-program car at that time. If there were fewer program cars in our fleet, these benefits would diminish and we would bear increased risk related to residual value. In addition, the related depreciation on our car rental fleet and our flexibility to reduce the size of our fleet by returning cars sooner than originally expected without the risk of loss in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand would be reduced.\nWe may fail to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer demands.\nIn recent years our industry has been characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer demands. For example, in recent years, industry participants have taken advantage of new technologies to improve fleet efficiency, decrease customer wait times and improve customer satisfaction. Many industries have also seen the entry of new competitors whose businesses are based on emerging mobile platforms. Our ability to continually improve our current processes and products in response to changes in technology is essential in maintaining our competitive position and maintaining current levels of customer satisfaction. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced product offerings.\nIf we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced cars or equipment and the cost of the cars or equipment we purchase increases, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe price and other terms at which we can acquire cars vary based on market and other conditions. For example, certain car manufacturers have in the past, and may in the future, utilize strategies to de-emphasize sales to the car rental industry, which can negatively impact our ability to obtain cars on competitive terms and conditions. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. Reduced or limited supplies of equipment together with increased prices are risks that we also face in our equipment rental business. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of cars or equipment, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms when we acquire cars or equipment and are unable to pass on any increased costs to our customers, then our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nA material downsizing of our rental car fleet could require us to make additional cash payments for tax liabilities, which could be material.\nWe have maintained like-kind exchange programs for our U.S. car rental business, HERC and Donlen for a number of years. Our like-kind exchange programs allow tax gains on the disposition of vehicles in our car rental fleet to be deferred and have resulted in deferrals of federal and state income taxes for prior years. If a qualified replacement\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nvehicle is not purchased within a specific time period after vehicle disposal, then taxable gain is recognized. A material reduction in the net book value of our car rental fleet, a material and extended reduction in vehicle purchases and/or a material downsizing of our car rental fleet, for any reason, could result in reduced tax deferrals in the future, which in turn could require us to make material cash payments for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities.\nThe failure of a manufacturer of our program cars to fulfill its obligations under a repurchase or guaranteed depreciation program could expose us to loss on those program cars and materially adversely affect certain of our financing arrangements, which could in turn materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any manufacturer of our program cars does not fulfill its obligations under its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreement with us, whether due to default, reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, then we would have to dispose of those program cars without receiving the benefits of the associated programs and we would also be exposed to residual risk with respect to these cars. In addition, we could be left with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with respect to program cars that were sold and returned to the manufacturer but not paid for, or that were sold for less than their agreed repurchase price or guaranteed value.\nThe failure by a manufacturer to pay such amounts could cause a credit enhancement deficiency with respect to our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements, requiring us to either reduce the outstanding principal amount of debt or provide more collateral (in the form of cash, vehicles and/or certain other contractual rights) to the creditors under any such affected arrangement.\nIf one or more manufacturers were to adversely modify or eliminate repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs in the future, our access to and the terms of asset-backed and asset-based debt financing could be adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels for a significant amount of our revenues.\nThird-party distribution channels accounted for a significant amount of our car rental reservations for the year ended December 31, 2015. These third-party distribution channels include traditional and online travel agencies, third-party internet sites, airlines and hotel companies, marketing partners such as credit card companies and membership organizations and global distribution systems that allow travel agents, travel service providers and customers to connect directly to our reservations systems. Loss of access to any of these channels, changes in pricing or commission structures or a reduction in transaction volume could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations, particularly if our customers are unable to access our reservation systems through alternate channels.\nOur equipment rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices we expect.\nThe market value of our equipment at the time of its disposition could be less than its estimated residual value or its depreciated value at such time. A number of factors could affect the value received upon disposition of our equipment, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price for similar new equipment;\n\u2022\nwear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance;\n\u2022\nthe time of year that it is sold;\n\u2022\nthe supply of used equipment relative to the demand for used equipment, including as a result of changes in economic conditions or conditions in the markets that we serve; and\n\u2022\nthe existence and capacities of different sales outlets and our ability to develop and maintain different types of sales outlets.\nSince we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold, a sale of equipment below its depreciated value could adversely affect our income from operations. Accordingly, our ability to reduce the size of our equipment rental fleet in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand is subject to the risk of loss based on the residual value of rental equipment.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWe incur maintenance and repair costs associated with our equipment rental fleet that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in the event these costs are greater than anticipated.\nAs our fleet of rental equipment ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, generally increases. Determining the optimal age at disposition for our rental equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates by management. We have made estimates regarding the relationship between the age of our rental equipment, the maintenance and repair costs and the market value of used equipment, the availability of our fleet and the market value of used equipment. If maintenance and repair costs are higher than estimated or in-service times or market values of used equipment are lower than estimated, our future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur HERC business is cyclical and a slowdown in economic conditions or adverse changes in the economic factors specific to the industries in which HERC operates, such as a decrease in the expected levels of infrastructure spending or the expected levels of rental versus ownership of equipment, could have adverse effects on our liquidity, cash flows and results of operation.\nA substantial portion of HERC\u2019s revenues are derived from the rental of equipment in the non-residential construction and industrial end markets, which are cyclical in nature. The equipment rental industry experienced a decline in construction and industrial activity as a result of the economic downturn that commenced in the latter part of 2008 and continued through 2010. The weakness in HERC\u2019s end markets led to a decrease in the demand for rental equipment and intensifying price competition from other equipment rental industry participants. In addition, other industries in which HERC operates, such as the oil and gas industry and the entertainment industry, may be subject to different factors and economic cycles that could have an effect on demand for our products and services within those industries. Recently, declines in oil prices have led to a significant slowdown in activity in the oil and gas industry, which has negatively affected our rentals to participants in this industry. While many areas of the global economy are improving, a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to North American construction and industrial activities, could have an effect on demand for our products and services within those industries and ultimately could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nThe following factors, among others, may cause weakness in our end markets, either temporarily or long-term:\n\u2022\na decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending;\n\u2022\na decrease in the expected levels of rental versus ownership of equipment;\n\u2022\na lack of availability of credit;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of construction materials;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest rates;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, which may temporarily affect a particular region; or\n\u2022\nterrorism or hostilities involving the United States, Canada or international markets.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategy of further reducing operating costs and our cost reduction initiatives may have adverse consequences.\nWe are continuing to implement initiatives to reduce our operating expenses. These initiatives may include headcount reductions, business process outsourcing, business process re-engineering, internal reorganization and other expense controls. We cannot assure you that our cost reduction initiatives will achieve any further success. Whether or not successful, our cost reduction initiatives involve significant expenses and we expect to incur further expenses associated with these initiatives, some of which may be material in the period in which they are incurred.\nEven if we achieve further success with our cost reduction initiatives, we face risks associated with our initiatives, including declines in employee morale or the level of customer service we provide, the efficiency of our operations or the effectiveness of our internal controls. Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf our new initiatives to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and increase customer loyalty are not successful, our margins may suffer.\nWe have moved aggressively to pursue opportunities to deliver cost savings, increase our efficiency and regain customer loyalty. If we are unsuccessful in taking advantage of these opportunities, we may be unable to align our cost structure to lower levels of demand, which could depress our margins and negatively impact our ability to effectively compete. In addition, some internet travel intermediaries use generic indicators of the type of vehicle (such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201ccompact\u201d) at the expense of brand identification and some intermediaries have launched their own loyalty programs to develop loyalties to their reservation system rather than to our brands. If the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, our business and revenues could be harmed. If our market share suffers due to lower levels of customer loyalty, our financial results could suffer.\nAn impairment of our goodwill or our indefinite lived intangible assets could have a material non-cash adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and at least annually. If economic deterioration occurs, then we may be required to record charges for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairments in the future, which could have a material adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations.\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our annual revenues are generated outside the U.S., and we intend to pursue additional international growth opportunities. Operating in many different countries exposes us to varying risks, which include: (i) multiple, and sometimes conflicting, foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are subject to change and are often much different than the domestic laws in the U.S., including laws relating to taxes, automobile-related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, cost and fee recovery, and the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property; (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation risk, as well as limitations on our ability to repatriate income; (iii) varying tax regimes, including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws; (iv) local ownership or investment requirements, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (v) political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism. Operating in many different countries also increases the risk of a violation, or alleged violation, of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and ability to diversify internationally.\nManufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business.\nOur cars may be subject to safety recalls by their manufacturers. A recall may cause us to retrieve cars from renters and decline to rent recalled cars until we can arrange for the steps described in the recall to be taken. If a large number of cars are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply, we may not be able to rent recalled cars for a significant period of time. Those types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles, and could also result in the loss of business to our competitors. Depending on the severity of any recall, it could materially adversely affect our revenues, create customer service problems, reduce the residual value of the recalled cars and harm our general reputation.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized information technology systems and the concentration of our systems creates risks for us.\nWe rely heavily on communication networks and information technology systems to accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our pricing, manage our fleets of cars and equipment, manage our financing arrangements, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business. Our reliance on these networks and systems exposes us to various risks that could cause a loss of reservations, interfere with our ability to manage our fleet, slow rental and sales processes, adversely affect our ability to comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our major information technology systems, reservations and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations worldwide. Any disruption, termination\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nor substandard provision of these services, whether as the result of localized conditions (such as a fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as an earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and information technology functions or by eliminating access to financing arrangements. Any disruption or poor performance of our systems could lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nFailure to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information technology networks could adversely affect us.\nWe are continuously upgrading and consolidating our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. In particular, we currently have a material weakness in our internal control due, in part, to the weakness in our accounting system. In addition, we have decided to outsource a significant portion of our information technology services. These types of activities subject us to additional costs and inherent risks associated with outsourcing, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to manage our business, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to outsourcing alternatives, new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. Our outsourcing initiatives and system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the implementation of our outsourcing initiatives and new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated and our competitive position may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain systems that allow us to manage our business in a competitive manner.\nThe misuse or theft of information we possess, including as a result of cyber security breaches, could harm our brand, reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities.\nWe regularly possess, store and handle non-public information about millions of individuals and businesses, including both credit and debit card information and other sensitive and confidential personal information. In addition, our customers regularly transmit confidential information to us via the internet and through other electronic means. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception of our employees or contractors. Many of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, including viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, are difficult to anticipate until launched against a target and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. Our failure to maintain the security of that data, whether as the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, result in governmental investigations and give rise to a host of civil or criminal liabilities. Any such failure could lead to lower revenues, increased remediation, prevention and other costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nOur leases and vehicle rental concessions expose us to risks.\nWe maintain a substantial network of car rental locations at a number of airports in the U.S. and internationally. Many of these locations are leased and, in the case of airport car rental locations, the subject of vehicle rental concessions where vehicle rental companies are frequently required to bid periodically for the available locations. If we are unable to continue operating these facilities at their current locations due to the termination of leases or vehicle rental concessions, particularly at airports, which comprise a majority of our revenues, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon the favorable brand recognition that our \"Hertz'', \"Dollar\", \"Thrifty\", and \"Firefly\" brand names have in the markets in which they participate. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as marketing and advertising\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ncampaigns, may not have their desired effects. In addition, although our licensing partners are subject to contractual requirements to protect our brands, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. Any decline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business operations are dependent upon our new senior management team and the ability of our other new employees to learn their new roles.\nWithin the past three years, we have substantially changed our senior management team and have replaced many of the other employees performing key functions at our corporate headquarters. We have a new Chief Executive Officer who started on November 20, 2014, a new Chief Financial Officer who started on December 9, 2013 and many other new members of our senior management team. In addition, in connection with the transition of our corporate headquarters from Park Ridge, New Jersey to Estero, Florida, we have replaced many other employees in other key functions. As new employees gain experience in their roles, we could experience inefficiencies or a lack of business continuity due to loss of historical knowledge and a lack of familiarity of new employees with business processes, operating requirements, policies and procedures, some of which are new, and key information technologies and related infrastructure used in our day-to-day operations and financial reporting and we may experience additional costs as new employees learn their roles and gain necessary experience. It is important to our success that these key employees quickly adapt to and excel in their new roles. If they are unable to do so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we were to lose the services of any one or more key employees, whether due to death, disability or termination of employment, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans, marketing and other objectives, could be significantly impaired.\nWe may face issues with our union employees.\nLabor contracts covering the terms of employment of approximately 6,200 employees in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect under approximately 130 active contracts with local unions, affiliated primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. These contracts are renegotiated periodically. Failure to negotiate a new labor agreement when required could result in a work stoppage. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been good, it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions, or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future. In addition, our non-union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past, and we could be subject to future unionization, which could lead to increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements has been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees and lender and noteholder consent fees, in connection with the restatement of our previously issued financial statements and the ongoing remediation of weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including adding significant internal resources and implemented a number of additional procedures, in order to strengthen our accounting function and attempt to reduce the risk of additional misstatements in our financial statements. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense. Our management\u2019s attention has also been diverted from the operation of our business in connection with the restatements and ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe are also subject to a number of claims, investigations and proceedings arising out of the misstatements in our financial statements, including investigations by the New York Regional Office of the SEC and a state securities regulator. See below under \u201cThe restatement of our previously issued financial results has resulted in government investigations and could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\u201d\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015. The assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We are actively engaged in remediation activities designed to address the material weaknesses, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, it may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional waivers or repay amounts under these financing arrangements earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The next time we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing weaknesses, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms. We may also lose assets if we do not maintain adequate internal controls.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial results has resulted in government investigations and could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to securities class action litigation relating to our previous public disclosures. In addition, the New York Regional Office of the SEC and a state securities regulator are currently investigating the events disclosed in certain of our filings with the SEC. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 16, \"Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We could also become subject to private litigation or investigations, or one or more government enforcement actions, arising out of the misstatements in our previously issued financial statements. Our management may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already expended significant amounts investigating the claims underlying and defending this litigation and expect to continue to need to expend significant amounts to defend this litigation.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nAny future strategic acquisition or disposition of assets or a business could involve numerous risks, including: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; (ii) difficulty integrating the acquired business or segregating assets and operations to be disposed of; (iii) exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition or disposition or against any business we may acquire; (iv) changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences; and (v) the failure to achieve anticipated synergies.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf we enter into significant strategic transactions, the related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of an acquisition. The financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. A material disposition could require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof.\nThe separation of our car and equipment rental businesses into two independent, publicly traded companies will require significant time, resources and attention from management and may not be completed.\nIn March 2014, we announced our intention to separate our car and equipment rental businesses into two independent, publicly traded companies. This separation has been delayed by our thorough review of our historical financial statements and other unanticipated developments could result in further delays. Completing the separation will require significant time, resources and attention from management, which could distract management from the operation of our business and the execution of our other initiatives and we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the separation. If we are unable to complete the separation, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction and if we complete the separation, such transaction may not achieve the intended results. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles pending the completion of the separation. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSome or all of our deferred tax assets could expire if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\").\nAn \"ownership change\" could limit our ability to utilize tax attributes, including net operating losses, capital loss carryovers, excess foreign tax carry forwards, and credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4.1 billion (which begin to expire in 2029). Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382(g) of the Code. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\u2019s ownership (by value) of one or more \"5-percent shareholders\" (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally should be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss carryforward equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation accumulates each year to the extent that there is any unused limitation from a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax losses and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 depends on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \"ownership change\", it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income. Many states adopt the federal section 382 rules and therefore have similar limitations with respect to state tax attributes.\nWe face risks related to liabilities and insurance.\nOur businesses expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of the cars and equipment rented or sold by us, and for employment-related injury claims by our employees. The Company is currently a defendant in numerous actions and has received numerous claims on which actions have not yet been commenced for public liability and property damage arising from the operation of motor vehicles and equipment rented from the Company. Currently, we generally self-insure up to $10 million per occurrence in the U.S. and up to $5 million in Europe for vehicle and general liability exposures, $5 million for employment-related injury claims, and we also maintain insurance with unaffiliated carriers in excess of such levels up to $200 million per occurrence for the current policy year, or in the case of international operations outside of Europe, in such lower amounts as we deem adequate given the risks. We cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our historical levels resulting from multiple payouts or otherwise, that liabilities in respect of existing or future claims will not exceed the level of our insurance, that we will have sufficient capital available to pay any uninsured claims or that insurance with unaffiliated carriers will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Insurance and Risk Management\u2019\u2019 and Note 16, \"Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in multiemployer pension plans or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent and certain multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have underfunded liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe participate in various \"multiemployer\" pension plans. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. Our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 7, \"Employee Retirement Benefits,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any liability or obligation imposed under them, could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and motor and waste oils. We cannot assure you that our tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If leakage or a spill occurs, it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup, investigation and remediation, as well as any resulting fines, could be significant. We cannot assure you that compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\u2019\u2019 in this Annual Report.\nThe U.S. Congress and other legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our fleet and/or other costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to taxes, automobile-related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, automotive retail sales, cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of U.S. laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, including our profitability. Those changes may come about through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nAny new, or change in existing, U.S. law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability. For further discussion regarding how changes in the regulation of insurance intermediaries may affect us, see Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Insurance and Risk Management\u2019\u2019 in this Annual Report. If customers decline\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nto purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment in the areas of customer privacy, data security and cross-border data flow could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities, and the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements. It is also possible that we could face significant liability for failing to comply with any such requirements.\nWe derive revenue through rental activities of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands under franchise and license arrangements. These arrangements are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that impose limitations on our interactions with counter-parties. In addition, the automotive retail industry, including our network of company-operated car sales locations, is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor vehicle sales, retail installment sales and related finance and insurance matters, advertising, licensing, consumer protection and consumer privacy. Changes in these laws and regulations that impact our franchising arrangements or our automotive retail sales could adversely impact our results.\nIn most places where we operate, we pass through various expenses, including the recovery of vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, to our rental customers as separate charges. We believe that our expense pass throughs, where imposed, are properly disclosed and are lawful. However, in the event of incorrect calculations or disclosures with respect to expense pass throughs, or a successful challenge to the methodology we have used for determining our expense pass through treatment, we could be subject to fines or other liabilities. In addition, we may in the future be subject to potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes or actions which could limit, restrict or prohibit our ability to separately state, charge and recover vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations\nCertain new or proposed laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and amendments to Regulation AB, could restrict our access to certain financing arrangements and increase our financing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete in our industry.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had debt outstanding of $15.9 billion. Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect us. For example, it could: (i) make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt securities and to the lenders under our various credit facilities, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration or early amortization of, such indebtedness; (ii) be difficult to refinance or borrow additional funds in the future; (iii) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and investing activities to make payments on our debt, which would reduce our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes; (iv) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions (such as credit-related disruptions), including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are at floating rates of interest and are not hedged against rising interest rates, and the risk that one or more of the financial institutions providing commitments under our revolving credit facilities fails to fund an extension of credit under any such facility, due to insolvency or otherwise, leaving us with less liquidity than expected; (v) place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms; and (vi) limit our ability to react to competitive pressures, or make it difficult for us to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and our efforts to improve operating margins. While the terms of the agreements and instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness contain certain restrictions upon our ability to incur additional indebtedness, they do not fully prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness and do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other obligations are added to our current liability levels without a corresponding refinancing or redemption of our existing indebtedness and obligations, these risks would increase. For a description of the amounts we have available under certain of our debt facilities, see Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Borrowing Capacity and Availability\u201d included in this Annual Report and Note 6,\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\n\"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOur ability to manage these risks depends on financial market conditions as well as our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to a wide range of risks, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d included above in this Annual Report.\nIf our capital resources (including borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and access to other refinancing indebtedness) and operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to do, among other things, one or more of the following: (i) sell certain of our assets; (ii) reduce the size of our rental fleet; (iii) reduce or delay capital expenditures; (iv) obtain additional equity capital; (v) forgo business opportunities, including acquisitions and joint ventures; or (vi) restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will maintain financing activities and cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reliance on asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements to purchase cars subjects us to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe rely significantly on asset-backed and asset-based financing to purchase cars. If we are unable to refinance or replace our existing asset-backed and asset-based financing or continue to finance new car acquisitions through asset- backed or asset-based financing on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, then our costs of financing could increase significantly and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, interest costs, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur asset-backed and asset-based financing capacity could be decreased, our financing costs and interest rates could be increased, or our future access to the financial markets could be limited, as a result of risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements; (ii) the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset-backed indebtedness; (iii) third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements, including increased credit enhancement or required cash collateral and/or other liquid reserves; (iv) the insolvency or deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of our principal car manufacturers; or (v) changes in laws or regulations, including judicial review of issues of first impression, that negatively impact any of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements.\nAny reduction in the value of certain cars in our fleet could effectively increase our car fleet costs, adversely impact our profitability and potentially lead to decreased borrowing base availability in our asset-backed and certain asset-based vehicle financing facilities due to the credit enhancement requirements for such facilities, which could increase if market values for vehicles decrease below net book values for those vehicles. In addition, if disposal of vehicles in the used vehicle marketplace were to become severely limited at a time when required collateral levels were rising and as a result we failed to meet the minimum required collateral levels, the principal under our asset-backed and certain asset-based financing arrangements may be required to be repaid sooner than anticipated with vehicle disposition proceeds and lease payments we make to our special purpose financing subsidiaries. If that were to occur, the holders of our asset-backed and certain asset-based debt may have the ability to exercise their right to direct the trustee or other secured party to foreclose on and sell vehicles to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt.\nThe occurrence of certain events, including those described in the paragraph above, could result in the occurrence of an amortization event pursuant to which the proceeds of sales of cars that collateralize the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be required to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the affected facility or series, rather than being reinvested in our car rental fleet. In the case of our asset-backed financing arrangements, certain other events, including defaults by us and our affiliates in the performance of covenants set forth in the agreements governing certain fleet debt, could result in the occurrence of a liquidation event with the passing of time\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nor immediately pursuant to which the trustee or holders of the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be permitted to require the sale of the assets collateralizing that series. Any of these consequences could affect our liquidity and our ability to maintain sufficient fleet levels to meet customer demands and could trigger cross-defaults under certain of our other financing arrangements.\nAny reduction in the value of the equipment rental fleet of HERC (which could occur due to a reduction in the size of the fleet or the value of the assets within the fleet) could not only effectively increase our equipment rental fleet costs and adversely impact our profitability, but would result in decreased borrowing base availability under certain of our asset-based financing arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets secure certain of our outstanding indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our debt and equity holders and our business.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets, including our car and equipment rental fleets and Donlen's lease portfolio, are subject to security interests or are otherwise encumbered for the lenders under our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements. As a result, the lenders under those facilities would have a prior claim on such assets in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization, and we may not have sufficient funds to pay in full, or at all, all of our creditors or make any amount available to holders of our equity. The same is true with respect to structurally senior obligations: in general, all liabilities and other obligations of a subsidiary must be satisfied before the assets of such subsidiary can be made available to the creditors (or equity holders) of the parent entity.\nBecause substantially all of our assets are encumbered under financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial flexibility and force us to attempt to incur additional unsecured indebtedness, which may not be available to us.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may materially adversely affect our financial flexibility or may have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nCertain of our credit facilities and other asset-based and asset-backed financing arrangements contain covenants that, among other things, restrict Hertz and its subsidiaries' ability to: (i) dispose of assets; (ii) incur additional indebtedness; (iii) incur guarantee obligations; (iv) prepay other indebtedness or amend other financing arrangements; (v) pay dividends; (vi) create liens on assets; (vii) sell assets; (viii) make investments, loans, advances or capital expenditures; (ix) make acquisitions; (x) engage in mergers or consolidations; (xi) change the business conducted by us; and (xii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nOur Senior ABL Facility (as defined in Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d) contains a financial covenant that obligates us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio if we fail to maintain a specified minimum level of liquidity. Our ability to comply with this covenant will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn are subject to, among other things, the risks identified in \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nAdditionally, the documentation of various of our (and/or our special purpose subsidiaries') financing facilities require us to file certain quarterly and annual reports and certain of our subsidiaries to file statutory financial statements within certain time periods.\nThe agreements governing our financing arrangements contain numerous covenants. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the relevant agreement, which could, in turn, cause cross- defaults under our other financing arrangements. In such event, we may be unable to borrow under the Senior ABL Facility and certain of our other financing arrangements and may not be able to repay the amounts due under such arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nAn increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nHertz Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own and depends on its subsidiaries for cash.\nThe operations of Hertz Holdings are conducted nearly entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. However, none of the subsidiaries of Hertz Holdings are obligated to make funds available to Hertz Holdings for the payment of dividends or the service of its debt. In addition, certain states' laws and the terms of certain of our debt agreements significantly restrict, or prohibit, the ability of Hertz and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to Hertz Holdings, including state laws that require dividends to be paid only from surplus. If Hertz Holdings does not receive cash from its subsidiaries, then Hertz Holdings' financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur share price may decline if we issue a large number of new shares or if a holder of a substantial number of shares sells their stock.\nWe have a significant number of authorized but unissued shares, including shares available for issuance pursuant to our various equity plans. In addition, in recent years, several shareholders, most notably affiliates of Carl Icahn, have accumulated significant amounts of Hertz Holdings common stock. A sale of a substantial number of our shares or other equity-related securities in the public market pursuant to new issuances or by these significant shareholders could depress the market price of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any such sale or issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the then-existing stockholders, and could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91575, "SIC": 7350, "TIC": "HRI"}
