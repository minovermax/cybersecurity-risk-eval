RISK FACTORS\nWe wish to caution you that there are many risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this report, particularly found in \"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements.\" The following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties, as it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Unknown or unidentified additional risks and uncertainties could also adversely affect our business. In addition, the risks described below are not listed in order of the likelihood that the risk might occur or the severity of the impact if the risk should occur.\nRisks Associated with our Business Strategy\nAs noted on page 6, our overall business strategy is focused on several initiatives. If we cannot successfully execute our business strategy, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. There are numerous risks associated with this strategy including, but not limited to, the following:\nOur strategy related to the Jos. A. Bank brand may negatively impact our short-term and long-term profitability.\nReengineering the Jos. A. Bank brand to a long-term, sustainable profit model is a key part of our business strategy. There can be no assurance that strategic initiatives being implemented at Jos. A. Bank will favorably impact the Jos. A. Bank's operations or will be successfully executed or executed in the time period projected. Any failure to successfully and timely implement these initiatives can be expected to negatively impact Jos. A. Bank's sales and profitability.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Jos A. Bank, which could adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nWe have devoted and will continue to devote significant managerial attention and resources into the operations of Jos. A. Bank. While we believe that we have sufficient resources to realize the benefits of the acquisition, there are a number of significant risks involved. There can be no assurance that:\n\u2022 the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the acquisition;\n\u2022 litigation relating to the acquisition will not be filed;\n\u2022 we will be able to retain key personnel or that labor issues will not arise; and\n\u2022 the acquisition will not cause disruption to our business, operations and relationships with our customers, employees, suppliers and other important third parties.\nIf we are unable to achieve a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe may not realize the benefits of our profit improvement and store rationalization programs.\nIn March 2016, we announced profit improvement and store rationalization programs. The estimated costs and benefits associated with these programs are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors including: the timing in execution of the programs, outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, inventory levels, and changes in management's assumptions and projections. As a result of these events and circumstances, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all, or any, of the anticipated benefits of these programs.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to meet the changing preferences of our customers and manage merchandise lead times.\nWe believe that men's attire is characterized by infrequent and more predictable fashion changes. Our success, however, is dependent in part upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. As our business is seasonal, we must purchase and carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling seasons.\nWe issue purchase orders for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts. In addition, lead times for many of our purchases are lengthy, which may make it more difficult for us to respond quickly to new or changing merchandise trends or consumer acceptance of our products. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe our overall product mix makes our business less vulnerable to changes in merchandise trends than many fashion-forward and specialty apparel retailers; however, our sales and profitability depend upon our continued ability to effectively manage a variety of competitive challenges, including:\n\u2022 anticipating and quickly responding to changing trends and consumer demands;\n\u2022 maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;\n\u2022 developing innovative, high-quality new products and/or product and brand extensions in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes;\n\u2022 competitively pricing our products and providing superior service and value to our customers;\n\u2022 countering the promotional or other pricing activities of our competitors; and\n\u2022 providing strong and effective marketing support.\nIncreased competition or our failure to meet these competitive challenges could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in omni-channel initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. We continue to explore additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to continue to expand our stores may be limited.\nA large part of our growth has resulted from the addition of new Men's Wearhouse stores and the increased sales volume and profitability provided by these stores. In addition, the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank significantly increased the total number of retail stores we operate. As of January 30, 2016, we operate 713 Men's Wearhouse stores, 625 Jos. A. Bank stores, 124 Moores stores, and 89 K&G stores. We will continue to depend on adding new stores to increase our sales volume and profitability; however, we believe that our ability to increase the number of new stores in the U.S. and Canada may be limited. Therefore, we may not be able to achieve the same rate of growth as we have historically.\nIn addition, our ability to open new stores will depend on our ability to obtain suitable locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, hire qualified personnel and open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis. Continued expansion will place increasing demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively and in turn, could adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. Further, the results achieved by our existing stores may not be indicative of the performance or market acceptance of stores in other locations and the opening of new stores in existing markets may adversely affect sales and profits of established stores in those same markets.\nOur strategy related to shops within Macy's stores may negatively impact our short-term and long-term profitability.\nOn June 10, 2015, we entered into a 10-year agreement with Macy's, Inc. to operate men's tuxedo rental shops inside 300 Macy's department stores. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 12 tuxedo shops within Macy's stores under the name \"The Tuxedo Shop @ Macy's.\" Our shops within Macy's stores use selling space within Macy's and are dependent on the Macy's point-of-sale platform. There can be no assurance that our shops within Macy's stores will be successful. In addition, the Macy's management team, including their strategic and marketing decisions, may have an effect on the success of our shops within Macy's stores. We have limited influence over these factors, and a strategic shift by the Macy's management team or a significant disruption in Macy's operations could adversely affect the results of our shops within Macy's stores.\nCertain of our expansion strategies may present greater risks.\nWe are continuously assessing opportunities to expand store concepts and complementary products and services related to our core business, such as corporate apparel and uniform sales. We may expend both capital and personnel resources on such business opportunities which may or may not be successful. Additionally, any new concept is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation and the ability to obtain suitable sites. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow new concepts to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow.\nAny future acquisitions that we may undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and harm our operating results.\nIn the event we complete one or more new acquisitions, we may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated with an ability to integrate acquired assets, systems or operations into our existing operations, diversion of management's attention from core operational matters, higher costs, or unexpected difficulties or problems with acquired assets or entities, outdated or incompatible technologies, labor difficulties or an inability to realize anticipated synergies and efficiencies, whether within anticipated time frames or at all. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Associated with General Economic Conditions\nNumerous economic conditions, all of which are outside of our control, could negatively affect the level of consumer spending on the merchandise that we offer. If these economic conditions persist for a sustained period, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\nOur business is particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence.\nChanges in U.S., Canadian, UK and global economic and political conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending. The continuation and/or\nrecurrence of these market, political and economic conditions could intensify the adverse effect of such conditions on our revenues and operating results. Consumer confidence may also be adversely affected by national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism, public health events or natural disasters (or the threat of any of these).\nOur business may be adversely affected by a worsening of economic conditions, increases in consumer debt levels and applicable interest rates, uncertainties regarding future economic prospects or a decline in consumer confidence or credit availability. During an actual or perceived economic downturn, fewer customers may shop with us and those who do shop may limit the amounts of their purchases. As a result, we could be required to take significant markdowns and/or increase our marketing and promotional expenses in response to the lower than anticipated levels of demand for our products. In addition, promotional and/or prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, as a result of adverse market, political or economic conditions, customers may delay or postpone indefinitely roll-outs of new corporate wear programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our corporate apparel segment.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our sales and expect our sales to fluctuate in the future.\nWe believe that a variety of factors affect comparable sales results including, but not limited to, consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending, changes in economic conditions and consumer disposable income, spending patterns and debt levels, consumer credit availability, weather conditions, the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, changes in the popularity of a retail center, the timing and level of promotional pricing or markdowns, store closings, relocations and remodels, changes in fashion trends and our merchandise mix or other competitive factors. Comparable sales fluctuations may impact our ability to leverage our fixed direct expenses, including store rent and store asset depreciation, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal.\nOur sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our rental revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is considered the seasonal low point. In addition, Jos. A. Bank has historically experienced increased customer traffic during the holiday season and its increased marketing efforts during the holiday season have historically resulted in sales and net earnings generated in the fourth quarter, which are significantly larger as compared to the other three quarters. This trend did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our decision to change the brand's promotional cadence. We currently expect this trend to resume in the future. With respect to our corporate apparel sales and operating results, seasonal fluctuations are not significant but the acquisition of new customers or existing customer decisions to rebrand or revise their corporate wear programs can cause significant variations in period results. Because of these fluctuations in our sales, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year.\nRisks Associated With Our Sourcing and Distribution Strategies\nOur sourcing and distribution strategies are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nThe loss of, or disruption in, our distribution centers could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores.\nAll retail apparel merchandise for Men's Wearhouse stores is received into our Houston distribution centers, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and either placed in back-stock or shipped to our stores. In the majority of our larger markets, we also have separate hub facilities or space within certain Men's Wearhouse stores used as redistribution facilities for their respective geographical areas. Our rental product is also stored in our Houston distribution center and, to a lesser extent, in five additional distribution facilities located in the U.S. and one in Canada. Merchandise for Jos. A. Bank is received and distributed from our distribution centers in Hampstead and Eldersburg, Maryland, while most merchandise for Moores is distributed from our distribution center in Montreal, Quebec. The majority of merchandise for our K&G stores is direct shipped by vendors to the stores while the remainder is transported to our K&G stores via a third-party logistics firm. All corporate apparel merchandise is received into our distribution facilities located in Houston or California for our U.S. operations and Long Eaton or Glasgow for our UK operations.\nWe depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules, proper functioning of our information technology and inventory control systems and overall effective management of the distribution centers. Events, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, software malfunctions, employee matters or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. For example, given our proximity to the Texas gulf coast, it is possible that a hurricane or tropical storm could damage the Houston distribution centers, result in extended power outages or flood roadways into and around the distribution centers, any of which would disrupt or delay deliveries to the Houston distribution centers and to our stores.\nAlthough we maintain business interruption and property insurance, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be paid timely to us, in the event any of our distribution centers are damaged or shut down for any reason, or if we incur higher costs and longer lead times in connection with a disruption at one or more of our distribution centers.\nOur business is global in scope and can be impacted by factors beyond our control.\nAs a result of our international operations and our sourcing of merchandise and rental product from vendors located outside of the U. S., we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors which are beyond our control. Such factors that could harm our results of operations and financial condition include, among other things:\n\u2022 political instability, civil strife or insurrection, or acts of terrorism, which disrupt trade with the countries where we operate or in which our contractors, suppliers or customers are located;\n\u2022 recessions in foreign economies;\n\u2022 logistic and other challenges in managing our foreign operations;\n\u2022 imposition of new legislation or rules relating to imports that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the U. S. from certain countries or regions;\n\u2022 obligations associated with being an importer of record, including monitoring and complying with all corresponding legal requirements;\n\u2022 imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;\n\u2022 delays in shipping due to port security considerations or labor disputes;\n\u2022 issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity;\n\u2022 migration of our manufacturers, which can affect where our raw materials and/or products are or will be produced;\n\u2022 volatile global economic, market or political environments;\n\u2022 volatile shipping availability, fuel supplies and related costs;\n\u2022 the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies used by our suppliers;\n\u2022 increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u2022 restrictions on the transfer of funds between the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to import risks, including potential disruptions in supply, changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and export restrictions on imported merchandise, and economic, political or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is sourced or imported.\nMany of the products sold in our stores and our corporate apparel operations are sourced from various foreign countries. Political or financial instability, war, civil strife, terrorism, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity limitations, labor disruptions, and other factors relating to international trade are beyond our control and could affect the availability and the price of our inventory.\nWe require our vendors to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal policy requirements. Our business could be adversely affected if our vendors do not comply with applicable legal requirements, our vendor policies and practices generally acceptable in the U. S. regarding social and ethical matters and acceptable labor and sourcing practices (collectively, \"Vendor Requirements\").\nThe violation of our Vendor Requirements by any of our vendors could disrupt our supply chain. In addition, any such violation could damage our reputation, which may result in decreased customer traffic to our stores, websites and call center. In the event of any violations, we may decide that it is necessary or desirable to seek alternative vendors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased costs of the raw materials and other resources that are important to our business.\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. In addition, our transportation and labor costs are subject to price volatility caused by the price of oil, supply of labor, governmental regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. Increases in demand for, or the price of, raw materials, distribution services and labor, including federal and state minimum wage rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe increase in the costs of wool and other raw materials significant to the manufacturer of apparel and the costs of manufacturing could materially affect our results of operations to the extent they cannot be mitigated through price increases and relocation to lower cost sources of supply or other cost reductions.\nThese increased costs could particularly impact our managed contract corporate wear business which tends to have more long term contractually committed customer sales arrangements with limited price flexibility.\nAny significant interruption in raw materials could cause interruptions at our U.S. tailored clothing factory.\nThe principal raw material used by our U.S. tailored clothing factory is fabric. Most of the factory's supply arrangements are seasonal. The factory does not have any long-term agreements in place with its fabric suppliers; therefore, there can be no assurance that any of such suppliers will continue to do business with us in the future. If a particular mill were to experience a delay due to fire or natural disaster and become unable to meet the factory's supply needs, it could take a period of up to several months for us to arrange for and receive an alternate supply of such fabric. In addition, import and export delays caused, for example, by an extended strike at the port of entry, could prevent the factory from receiving fabric or other raw materials shipped by its suppliers. Therefore, there could be a negative effect on the ability of the factory to meet its production goals if there is an unexpected loss of a supplier of fabric or other raw materials or a long interruption in shipments from any fabric or other raw material supplier.\nLabor union disputes could impact our business.\nApproximately 700 of our employees at the factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts that manufactures our Joseph Abboud clothing are members of Unite Here, a New England based labor union. Also, approximately 290 employees working in the Jos. A. Bank Hampstead, Maryland tailoring overflow shop and distribution centers are represented by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Joint Board, Local 806 and, approximately 120 Jos. A. Bank sales associates in New York City and four surrounding New York counties are represented by Local 340, New York New Jersey Regional Joint Board, Workers United. Should a labor dispute arise, we could experience shortages in product to sell in our stores or disruptions in services provided at our Jos. A. Bank stores.\nRisks Associated with Our Information Technology Systems\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. Information technology systems are subject to numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of the systems that operate as anticipated, reliance on third-party computer hardware, network and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, computer hackers and other similar disruptions, any of which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIf we are unable to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively, our business could be disrupted or our sales or profitability could be reduced.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and successfully implement new technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. We also maintain multiple internet websites in the U.S. and a number of other countries. In addition, we must protect the confidentiality of our and our customers' data. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability.\nWe are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes, and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, exfiltration, or damage. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential\ninformation about our customers as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. While we have implemented measures reasonably designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our systems or our third-party service providers' systems may still be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents including attacks by unauthorized users, corruption by computer viruses or other malicious software code, emerging cybersecurity risks, inadvertent or intentional release of confidential or proprietary information, or other similar events. The occurrence of any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information about us or our customers, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could, among other things:\n\u2022 cause damage to our reputation;\n\u2022 allow competitors access to our proprietary business information;\n\u2022 subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard customer data;\n\u2022 subject us to financial and legal risks, including regulatory action or litigation;\n\u2022 impact our ability to process credit card transactions; and\n\u2022 require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.\nIn this respect, credit card companies required businesses that accept their credit cards to implement chip card recognition systems by October 2015. Because of delays caused by vendor software and the certification process of chip technology, we expect to complete the implementation of the chip technology during 2016. As a result, in the event of a data breach before we have the technology in place, we may face liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the storage and transmission of such data is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or our employees fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to fines, penalties, administrative orders and other legal risks as a result of a breach or non-compliance.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous other risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nWe may be negatively impacted by competition.\nBoth the men's retail and the corporate apparel industries are highly competitive with numerous participants. We compete with traditional department stores, other specialty men's clothing stores, online retailers, online tuxedo rental providers, off-price retailers, manufacturer-owned and independently-owned outlet stores and their e-commerce channels, independently owned tuxedo rental stores and other corporate apparel providers. In addition, some of our primary competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls or retail centers as our stores, which results in competition for favorable site locations and lease terms in these shopping malls and retail centers. Increased competition or our failure to meet these competitive challenges could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success significantly depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team and other key personnel. Although we believe we have a strong management team with significant industry expertise, we face intense competition in hiring and retaining these personnel and the extended loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, our continued success and the achievement of our expansion goals are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees. If we are unable to retain and motivate our current personnel and attract talented new personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe occurrence of an event that impacts our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brands. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity and customer service. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Public perception about our company as a whole, our products or our stores, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls and provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to prevent security breaches could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional time and resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWar, acts of terrorism, public health crises, or weather catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the event of war, acts of terrorism or the threat of terrorist attacks, public health crises, or weather catastrophes, consumer spending could significantly decrease for a sustained period. In addition, local authorities or shopping center management could close in response to any immediate security concern, public health concern or weather catastrophe such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Similarly, war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorist attacks, or a weather catastrophe could severely and adversely affect our offices, distribution centers, or our entire supply chain.\nFluctuations in exchange rates may cause us to experience currency exchange losses.\nMoores, our Canadian subsidiary, conducts most of its business in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\") but purchases a significant portion of its merchandise in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between CAD and U.S. dollars has fluctuated historically. Recently, the value of the CAD against the U.S. dollar has weakened. If this valuation does not improve, then the revenues and earnings of our Canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to U.S. dollars. Also, the value of our Canadian net assets as expressed in U.S. dollars may decline. Moores utilizes foreign currency hedging contracts related to its merchandise purchases to limit exposure to changes in U.S. dollar/CAD exchange rates; however, these hedging activities may not adequately protect our Canadian operations from exchange rate risk.\nDimensions and Alexandra, our UK-based operations, sell their products and conduct their business primarily in pounds Sterling (\"GBP\") but purchase most of their merchandise in U.S. dollars or Euros. The exchange rate between the GBP, Euro and U.S. dollar has fluctuated historically. A decline in the value of the GBP as compared to the Euro or U.S. dollar may adversely impact our UK operating results as the cost of merchandise purchases will increase, particularly in relation to longer term customer\ncontracts that have little or no pricing adjustment provisions, and the revenues and earnings of our UK operations will be reduced when they are translated to U.S. dollars. Also, the value of our UK net assets as expressed in U.S. dollars may decline. Dimensions and Alexandra may, from time to time, utilize foreign currency hedging contracts as well as price renegotiations to limit exposure to some of this risk; however, these activities may not adequately protect our UK operations from exchange rate risk.\nCompliance with changing regulations and standards for accounting, corporate governance, tax and employment laws could result in increased administrative expenses or litigation and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and reported financial results.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC and the NYSE, as well as applicable employment laws and the health care reform legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act. In addition, our business is subject to rules issued by the payment card industry (PCI), and laws, rules and regulations promulgated by international, national, state and local authorities, including laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy, use of consumer information, credit cards and advertising. All of these laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation thereof are subject to change and often application thereof may be unclear. As a result, from time to time, we are subject to inquiries, investigations, and/or litigation, including class action lawsuits, and administrative actions related to compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nShareholder activism, the current political environment, financial reform legislation and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform has led, and may continue to lead, to substantial new regulations and compliance obligations. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, or environmental issues, among other things, may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance.\nFailure to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance for many aspects of our business, including revenue recognition, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, leases and income taxes, are complex, continually evolving and involve subjective judgments. For example, recently issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. In addition, as discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we are evaluating the impact of the recently issued revenue standard on our business. These and other future changes in accounting rules or changes in the underlying estimates, assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe could incur losses due to impairment on long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. In fiscal 2015, we recorded $1.24 billion of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to Jos. A. Bank. In the future, significant\nnegative industry or general economic trends, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets may result in additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional activities have been the subject of review by state regulators and subject to lawsuits, specifically at Jos. A. Bank.\nJos. A. Bank has in the past been, and may from time to time in the future be, required to respond to inquiries from State Attorneys General related to its advertising practices. In addition, it is possible that the advertising, marketing and promotional activities of our other brands may be reviewed by state or other regulators. Although we endeavor to monitor and comply with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure that all advertising, marketing and promotional activities comply with all applicable legal requirements, many of the applicable legal requirements involve subjective judgments. It is possible that any resolution we may reach with any governmental authority may materially impact our current or future planned marketing program and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRights of our shareholders may be negatively affected if we issue any of the shares of preferred stock which our Board of Directors has authorized for issuance.\nWe have available for issuance 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue any or all of this preferred stock, in one or more series, without any further action on the part of shareholders. The rights of our shareholders may be negatively affected if we issue a series of preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or distribution upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nRisks Associated with Our Indebtedness\nThere are numerous risks associated with our indebtedness including, but not limited to, the following:\nOur current level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Jos A. Bank, we entered into a $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount senior secured facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") and a $500.0 million asset-based revolving facility (the \"ABL Facility\" together with the Term Loan Facility, the \"Credit Facilities\"). In addition, we issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"Senior Notes\"). After entering into the Credit Facilities and completing the offering of the Senior Notes, our indebtedness has increased substantially. As of January 30, 2016, our total indebtedness is approximately $1,655.9 million. In addition, we have up to $420.9 million of additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, excluding letters of credit totaling approximately $25.5 million issued and outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022 requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes;\n\u2022 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt than we do and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from exploiting.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. As of January 30, 2016, we have up to $420.9 million of additional borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, excluding letters of credit totaling approximately $25.5 million issued and outstanding.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including borrowings under the ABL Facility, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contain restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such disposition.\nIn addition, we rely, to a certain extent, on our subsidiaries to generate cash. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, is dependent, to a certain extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Each of our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and they do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose (other than the subsidiary guarantors in connection with their\nguarantees) or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness or to fund our and our subsidiaries' other cash obligations.\nFor example, at January 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $27.0 million. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. We currently do not intend to repatriate amounts held by foreign subsidiaries. As such, amounts held by our foreign subsidiaries are not expected to be available to repay our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the holders of the Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding amounts under such facilities due and payable and, with respect to the ABL Facility, terminate their commitments to loan money, and, in each case, foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under the Credit Facilities, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022 pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022 make certain investments;\n\u2022 issue capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; and\n\u2022 enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates.\nThese covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the ABL Facility requires us to comply with a financial maintenance covenant under certain circumstances. Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility, if applicable. If we violate this covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the ABL Facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nIf our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through our variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under such facilities bear interest at a variable rate, based on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. Interest rates are currently at relatively low levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all capacity under the ABL Facility is fully drawn, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in approximately a $5.0 million change in annual interest expense. Assuming LIBOR surpassed the 1% LIBOR floor provision on our Term Loan, we would be exposed to interest rate risk on such Term Loan. To partially mitigate such interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap to exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments for a portion of the outstanding Term Loan balance. In addition, we entered into the Incremental Facility Agreement No. 1 to the credit agreement governing the Term Loan to refinance $400.0 million principal amount of term loans that bore interest at a variable rate with $400.0 million principal amount of new term loans, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.0% per annum. After consideration of the swap and the refinancing, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in an approximate $2.4 million change in annual interest expense on our Term Loan.", "PERMNO": 77516, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "TLRDQ"}
