{"cik": "75594", "company": "PACIFICORP /OR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described below. Careful consideration of these risks, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and the other public information filed by us, should be made before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe are subject to operating uncertainties and events beyond our control that impact the costs to operate, maintain, repair and replace utility systems, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nThe operation of complex utility systems that are spread over large geographic areas involves many operating uncertainties and events beyond our control. These potential events include the breakdown or failure of our thermal, hydroelectric and other electricity generating facilities and related equipment, transmission and distribution lines or other equipment or processes, which could lead to catastrophic events; unscheduled outages; strikes, lockouts or other labor-related actions; shortages of qualified labor; transmission and distribution system constraints; terrorist activities or military or other actions, including cyberattacks; fuel shortages or interruptions; unavailability of critical equipment, materials and supplies; low water flows and other weather-related impacts; performance below expected levels of output, capacity or efficiency; operator error; design, construction or manufacturing defects; and catastrophic events such as severe storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, explosions, landslides, wars, terrorism, embargoes and mining accidents. A catastrophic event might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental or natural resource damages. For example, in the event of an uncontrolled release of water at one of our high hazard potential hydroelectric facilities, it is probable that loss of human life, disruption of lifeline facilities and property damage could occur in the downstream population and civil or other penalties could be imposed by the FERC. Any of these events or other operational events could significantly reduce or eliminate our revenue or significantly increase our expenses. For example, if we cannot operate our generating facilities at full capacity due to damage caused by a catastrophic event, our revenue could decrease and our expenses could increase due to the need to obtain energy from more expensive sources. Further, we self-insure many risks, and current and future insurance coverage may not be sufficient to replace lost revenue or cover repair and replacement costs. The scope, cost and availability of our insurance coverage may change, including the portion that is self-insured. Any reduction of our revenue or increase in our expenses resulting from the risks described above, could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local legislation and regulation, including numerous environmental, health, safety, reliability and other laws and regulations that affect our operations and costs. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. In addition, new laws and regulations are continually being proposed and enacted that impose new or revised requirements or standards on our business.\nWe are required to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations as described in Item 1 of this Form 10-K that have broad application to our business and limit our ability to independently make and implement management decisions regarding, among other items, constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; acquiring businesses; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transacting with affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. These laws and regulations are followed in developing our safety and compliance programs and procedures and are implemented and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies, such as, among others, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the FERC, the EPA, the MSHA and the various state regulatory commissions.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations generally requires us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses, permits, inspections, audits and other approvals. Further, compliance with laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures, including expenditures for new equipment, inspection, cleanup costs, removal and remediation costs, damages arising out of contaminated properties and refunds, fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets for failure to comply with environmental regulations. Compliance activities pursuant to existing or new laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive or otherwise uneconomical. As a result, we could be required to shut down some facilities or materially alter their operations. Further, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental or other regulatory approvals and permits for our operating assets or development projects. Delays in, or active opposition by third parties to, obtaining any required environmental or regulatory authorizations or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorizations may increase costs or prevent or delay us from operating our facilities, developing or favorably locating new facilities or expanding existing facilities. If we fail to comply with any environmental or other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to penalties and fines or other sanctions, including changes to the way our electricity generating facilities are operated that may adversely impact generation. The costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Not being able to operate existing facilities or develop new generating facilities to meet customer electricity needs could require us to increase our purchases of electricity on the wholesale market, which could increase market and price risks and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nExisting laws and regulations, while comprehensive, are subject to changes and revisions from ongoing policy initiatives by legislators and regulators and to interpretations that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. For example, changes in laws and regulations could result in, but are not limited to, increased competition within our service territories; new environmental requirements, including the implementation of RPS and GHG emissions reduction goals; the issuance of new or stricter air quality standards; the implementation of energy efficiency mandates; the issuance of regulations governing the management and disposal of coal combustion byproducts; changes in forecasting requirements; changes to our service territories as a result of condemnation or takeover by municipalities or other governmental entities, particularly where we lack the exclusive right to serve our customers; or a negative impact on our ability to recover costs. In addition to changes in existing legislation and regulation, new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted from time to time that impose additional or new requirements or standards on our business.\nImplementing actions required under, and otherwise complying with, new federal and state laws and regulations and changes in existing ones are among the most challenging aspects of managing utility operations. We cannot accurately predict the type or scope of future laws and regulations that may be enacted, changes in existing ones or new interpretations by agency orders or court decisions nor can we determine their impact on us at this time; however, any one of these could adversely affect our consolidated financial results through higher capital expenditures and operating costs or restrict or otherwise cause an adverse change in how we operate our business. To the extent that we are not allowed by our regulators to recover or cannot otherwise recover the costs to comply with new laws and regulations or changes in existing ones, the costs of complying with such additional requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Additionally, even if such costs are recoverable in rates, if they are substantial and result in rates increasing to levels that substantially reduce customer demand, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nRecovery of our costs and certain activities are subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs or undertake certain activities may adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nState Rate Proceedings\nRates are established for our regulated retail service through state regulatory proceedings. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including government bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but generally have the common objective of limiting rate increases while also requiring us to ensure system reliability. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, potentially leading to further uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings.\nStates set retail rates based in part upon the state regulatory commission's acceptance of an allocated share of total utility costs. When states adopt different methods to calculate interjurisdictional cost allocations, some costs may not be incorporated into rates of any state. Ratemaking is also generally done on the basis of estimates of normalized costs, so if a given year's realized costs are higher than normalized costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover those costs. In some cases, actual costs are lower than the normalized or estimated costs recovered through rates and from time-to-time may result in a state regulator requiring refunds to customers. Each state regulatory commission generally sets rates based on a test year established in accordance with that commission's policies. The test year data adopted by each state regulatory commission may create a lag between the incurrence of a cost and its recovery in rates. Each state regulatory commission also decides the allowed levels of expense, investment and capital structure that it deems are just and reasonable in providing the service and may disallow recovery in rates for any costs that it believes do not meet such standard. Additionally, each state regulatory commission establishes the allowed rate of return we will be given an opportunity to earn on our sources of capital. While rate regulation is premised on providing a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the state regulatory commissions do not guarantee that we will be able to realize a reasonable rate of return.\nIn certain states where energy cost adjustment mechanisms are in place, energy cost increases above the level assumed in establishing base rates are subject to customer sharing. Any significant increase in fuel costs for electricity generation or purchased electricity costs could have a negative impact on us, despite efforts to minimize this impact through the use of hedging contracts and sharing mechanisms or through future general rate cases. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nFERC Jurisdiction\nThe FERC authorizes cost-based rates associated with transmission services provided by our transmission facilities. Under the Federal Power Act, we may voluntarily file, or may be obligated to file, for changes, including general rate changes, to our system-wide transmission service rates. General rate changes implemented may be subject to refund. The FERC also has responsibility for approving both cost- and market-based rates under which we sell electricity at wholesale, has jurisdiction over most of our hydroelectric generating facilities and has broad jurisdiction over energy markets. The FERC may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility of these markets or could revoke or restrict our ability to sell electricity at market-based rates, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The FERC also maintains rules concerning standards of conduct, affiliate restrictions, interlocking directorates and cross-subsidization. The FERC may also impose substantial civil penalties for any non-compliance with the Federal Power Act and the FERC's rules and orders.\nThe NERC has standards in place to ensure the reliability of the electric transmission grid and generation system. We are subject to the NERC's regulations and periodic audits to ensure compliance with those regulations. The NERC may carry out enforcement actions for non-compliance and administer significant financial penalties, subject to the FERC's review.\nWe are actively pursuing, developing and constructing new or expanded facilities, the completion and expected costs of which are subject to significant risk, and we have significant funding needs related to our planned capital expenditures.\nWe actively pursue, develop and construct new or expanded facilities. We expect that we will incur substantial annual capital expenditures over the next several years. Such expenditures include and may include in the future, among others, construction and other costs for new electricity generating facilities, transmission or distribution projects, environmental control and compliance systems and continued maintenance and upgrades of existing assets.\nDevelopment and construction of major facilities are subject to substantial risks, including fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, manufactured goods, equipment, labor, siting and permitting and changes in environmental and operational compliance matters, load forecasts and other items over a multi-year construction period, as well as counterparty risk and the economic viability of our suppliers, customers and contractors. Certain of our construction projects are substantially dependent upon a single contractor and replacement of such contractor may be difficult and cannot be assured. These risks may result in the inability to timely complete a project or higher than expected costs to complete an asset and place it in-service. Such costs may not be recoverable in the rates we are able to charge our customers. It is also possible that additional generation needs may be obtained through power purchase agreements, which could increase long-term purchase obligations and force reliance on the operating performance of a third party. The inability to successfully and timely complete a project, avoid unexpected costs or recover any such costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nFurthermore, we depend upon both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. If we are unable to obtain funding from internal and external sources, we may need to postpone or cancel planned capital expenditures.\nFailure to construct our planned projects could limit opportunities for growth, increase operating costs and adversely affect the reliability of electricity service to our customers. For example, if we are not able to expand our existing portfolio of generating facilities, we may be required to enter into long-term wholesale electricity purchase contracts or purchase wholesale electricity at more volatile and potentially higher prices in the spot markets to serve retail loads.\nA significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity in the markets served by us would significantly decrease our operating revenue, could impact our planned capital expenditures and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nA significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity in the markets served by us would significantly decrease our operating revenue, could impact our planned capital expenditures and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include, among others:\n\u2022\na depression, recession or other adverse economic condition that results in a lower level of economic activity or reduced spending by consumers on electricity;\n\u2022\nan increase in the market price of electricity or a decrease in the price of other competing forms of energy;\n\u2022\nefforts by customers, legislators and regulators to reduce the consumption of electricity generated or distributed through various conservation, energy efficiency and distributed generation measures and programs;\n\u2022\nhigher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of the fuel source for electricity generation or that limit the use of the generation of electricity from fossil fuels;\n\u2022\na shift to more energy-efficient or alternative fuel machinery or an improvement in fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating higher fuel economy or lower emissions, price differentials, incentives or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nsustained mild weather that reduces heating or cooling needs.\nOur operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and may be adversely affected by weather.\nIn the markets in which we operate, demand for electricity peaks during the summer months when irrigation and cooling needs are higher. Market prices for electricity also generally peak at that time. In other areas, demand for electricity peaks during the winter when heating needs are higher. Further, extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves, winter storms or floods could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. Periods of low rainfall or snowpack may negatively impact electricity generation at our hydroelectric generating facilities, which may result in greater purchases of electricity from the wholesale market or from other sources at market prices. Additionally, we have added substantial wind-powered generating capacity, which is also a climate-dependent resource.\nAs a result, our overall consolidated financial results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis. We have historically provided less energy, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are mild. Unusually mild weather in the future may adversely affect our consolidated financial results through lower revenue or margins. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase our costs to provide energy and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The extent of fluctuation in our consolidated financial results may change depending on a number of factors related to our regulatory environment and contractual agreements, including our ability to recover energy costs and terms of our wholesale sale contracts.\nWe are subject to market risk associated with the wholesale energy markets, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nIn general, our primary market risk is adverse fluctuations in the market price of wholesale electricity and fuel, including natural gas, coal and fuel oil, which is compounded by volumetric changes affecting the availability of or demand for electricity and fuel. The market price of wholesale electricity may be influenced by several factors, such as the adequacy or type of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission and distribution facilities, weather conditions, demand for electricity, economic growth and changes in technology. Volumetric changes are caused by fluctuations in generation or changes in customer needs that can be due to the weather, electricity and fuel prices, the economy, regulations or customer behavior. For example, we purchase electricity and fuel in the open market as part of our normal operating business. If market prices rise, especially in a time when larger than expected volumes must be purchased at market prices, we may incur significantly greater expense than anticipated. Likewise, if electricity market prices decline in a period when we are a net seller of electricity in the wholesale market, we will earn less revenue. Although we have energy cost adjustment mechanisms in most states, the risks associated with changes in market prices may not be fully mitigated due to customer sharing bands and other factors.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our access to capital, increase the cost of borrowing or raise energy transaction credit support requirements.\nOur long-term debt is rated investment grade by various rating agencies. We cannot assure that our long-term debt will continue to be rated investment grade in the future. Although none of our outstanding debt has rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate a repayment obligation, a credit rating downgrade would increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit agreements and other financing arrangements, perhaps significantly. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, access to the commercial paper market, our principal source of short-term borrowings, could be significantly limited, resulting in higher interest costs.\nMost of our large wholesale customers, suppliers and counterparties require us to have sufficient creditworthiness in order to enter into transactions, particularly in the wholesale energy markets. If our credit ratings were to decline, especially below investment grade, financing costs and borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or some other form of security for existing transactions and as a condition to entering into future transactions with us. Such amounts may be material and may adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.\nPotential terrorist activities and the impact of military or other actions, including cyberattacks, could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nThe ongoing threat of terrorism and the impact of military or other actions by nations or politically, ethnically, or religiously motivated organizations regionally or globally may create increased political, economic, social and financial market instability, which could subject our operations to increased risks. Additionally, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically electric utility infrastructure, are potential targets for terrorist attacks, including cyberattacks. Cyberattacks could adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets or the assets of our customers or suppliers may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, sustained or significant cyberattacks, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk related to contractual payment obligations with wholesale suppliers and customers. Adverse economic conditions or other events affecting counterparties with whom we conduct business could impair the ability of these counterparties to meet their payment obligations. We depend on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis. We continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our wholesale suppliers and customers in an attempt to reduce the impact of any potential counterparty default. If strategies used to minimize these risk exposures are ineffective or if our wholesale suppliers' or customers' financial condition deteriorates or they otherwise become unable to pay, it could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity and consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to counterparty performance risk, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe are subject to counterparty performance risk related to performance of contractual obligations by wholesale suppliers, customers and contractors. We rely on wholesale suppliers to deliver commodities, primarily natural gas, coal and electricity, in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. Failure or delay by suppliers to provide these commodities pursuant to existing contracts could disrupt the delivery of electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet customer needs. In addition, when these contracts terminate, we may be unable to purchase the commodities on terms equivalent to the terms of current contracts.\nWe rely on wholesale customers to take delivery of the energy they have committed to purchase. Failure of customers to take delivery may require us to find other customers to take the energy at lower prices than the original customers committed to pay. If our wholesale customers are unable to fulfill their obligations, there may be a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial results.\nInflation and changes in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nInflation and increases in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may affect our business by increasing both operating and capital costs. If we are unable to manage cost increases or pass them on to our customers, our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.\nPoor performance of plan and fund investments and other factors impacting the pension and other postretirement benefit plans and mine reclamation trust funds could unfavorably impact our consolidated financial results.\nCosts of providing our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans and costs associated with the joint trustee and multiemployer plans to which we and our subsidiary contribute, respectively, depend upon a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of benefits provided, discount rates, mortality assumptions, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, the funded status of the plans, changes in benefit design, tax deductibility and funding limits, changes in laws and government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, as well as joint trustee and multiemployer plans to which we and our subsidiary contribute, respectively, are in underfunded positions. Furthermore, the funded status of the UMWA 1974 Pension Trust multiemployer plan to which our subsidiary contributes is considered critical, subjecting the plan to rehabilitation, including the previously issued funding improvement plan that is expected to require higher cash contributions in the future. To the extent we or our subsidiary withdraw from the multiemployer plans, we or our subsidiary may be subject to a significant withdrawal liability. To the extent a mass withdrawal from any of the multiemployer plans to which we or our subsidiary have contributed occurs, we or our subsidiary may be subject to a mass withdrawal liability associated with respective unfunded vested benefits even if we or our subsidiary voluntarily withdrew from the plan up to three years prior to the mass withdrawal. To the extent participating employers default on their obligations to the multiemployer plan to which our subsidiary contributes, our subsidiary could be subject to an allocation of respective unfunded vested benefits associated with those employers' obligations. Our pension and other postretirement benefit plans have investments in domestic and foreign equity and debt securities and other investments that are subject to loss. Losses from investments could add to the volatility, size and timing of future contributions. Similarly, funds dedicated to Bridger Coal Company mine reclamation are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments will reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require us to make additional cash contributions. Such cash funding obligations, which are also impacted by the other factors described above, could have a material impact on our liquidity by reducing available cash.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing, draw upon or renew existing credit facilities, and have other adverse effects on us.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing or to draw upon or renew existing credit facilities, and have other adverse effects on us. Significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the United States and global credit markets, such as those that occurred in 2008 and 2009, may materially impact liquidity in the bank and debt capital markets, making financing terms less attractive for borrowers that are able to find financing and, in other cases, may cause certain types of debt financing, or any financing, to be unavailable. Additionally, economic uncertainty in the United States or globally may adversely affect the United States' credit markets and could negatively impact our ability to access funds on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to access the bank and debt markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure needs, it may adversely affect the timing and amount of our capital expenditures and our consolidated financial results.\nWe are involved in a variety of legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe are, and in the future may become, a party to a variety of legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with certainty. It is possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we are involved could result in additional material payments substantially in excess of established reserves or in terms that could require that we change business practices and procedures or divest ownership of assets. Further, litigation could result in the imposition of financial penalties or injunctions and adverse regulatory consequences, any of which could limit our ability to take certain desired actions or the denial of needed permits, licenses or regulatory authority to conduct our business, including the siting or permitting of facilities. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nBHE could exercise control over us in a manner that would benefit BHE to the detriment of our creditors and preferred stockholders.\nBHE, through its subsidiary, owns all of our common stock and has control over all decisions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of our directors. In circumstances involving a conflict of interest between BHE and our creditors and preferred stockholders, BHE could exercise its control in a manner that would benefit BHE to the detriment of our creditors and preferred stockholders.", "PERMNO": 42833, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "MEC2"}
