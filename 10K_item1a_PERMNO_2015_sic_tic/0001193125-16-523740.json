{"cik": "1441693", "company": "MARRONE BIO INNOVATIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, growth prospects and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nWe have a limited number of commercialized products, have incurred significant losses to date and anticipate continuing to incur losses in the future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are an early stage company with a limited number of commercialized products. We have incurred operating losses since our inception in June 2006, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.6 million and $159.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $43.7 million, $51.7 million and $32.6 million, respectively. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress our stock price.\nThrough December 31, 2015, we have derived substantially all of our revenues from sales of Regalia and Grandevo. In addition, we have derived revenues from strategic collaboration and development agreements for the achievement of testing validation, regulatory progress and commercialization events, and from sales of other products. Accordingly, there is only a limited basis upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to market and sell other products, such as Zequanox, Venerate and Majestene, as well as our ability to increase sales of Regalia and Grandevo and to introduce new products. An investor in our stock should consider the challenges, expenses and difficulties we will face as a company seeking to develop and manufacture new types of products in a relatively established market. We expect to derive future revenues primarily from sales of Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate, Majestene and other products, but we cannot guarantee the magnitude of such sales, if any. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand our research and development activities, further increase manufacturing capabilities and expand our sales and marketing activities for the further commercialization of Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate and Majestene, and other product candidates. We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next several years, and may never become profitable.\nThere is uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We currently estimate that by the fourth quarter of 2016, without entering into strategic agreements that include significant cash payments upfront, significantly increasing revenues from sales or raising additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt, we will be below the minimum cash balance requirement in our promissory notes with affiliates of Waddell & Reed. Further, although under a promissory note with Five Star Bank our lender has waived a requirement to remain below a maximum debt-to-worth ratio under this agreement through December 31, 2016, we expect that immediately after this waiver has expired, we will be in violation of this covenant as well. Breach of covenants included in our debt agreements, which could result in the lenders demanding payment of the unpaid principal and interest balances, would have a material adverse effect upon our business and would likely require us to seek to renegotiate these debt arrangements with the lenders. If such negotiations are unsuccessful, we may be required to seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which depends on our ability to obtain further waivers of our covenants, or raise additional capital and increase revenues. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe expect to require additional financing in the future to meet our business requirements and to service our debt. Such capital raising may be costly, difficult or not possible to obtain and, if obtained, could significantly dilute current stockholders\u2019 equity interests, and we may be unable to repay our secured indebtedness.\nIn our August 2015 private placement transaction, we issued senior secured promissory notes in the initial aggregate principal amount of $40.0 million, which accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with $10.0 million payable three years from the closing, $10.0 million payable four years from the closing and $20.0 million payable five years from the closing. In June 2014, we borrowed $10.0 million pursuant to a promissory note with a bank, which accrues interest at a variable interest rate, 5.25% per annum as of December 31, 2015, and which is repayable in monthly payments through June 2036. We also completed private placements in October 2012 and April 2013 of promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $12.5 million, which accrue interest at 18% through maturity in October 2017. The debt agreements with respect to these transactions contain various financial and other covenants, as discussed below, and our obligations under the loan agreements are secured by all of our real and personal property assets and general intangibles.\nAs we expect to continue to incur significant losses until we are able to significantly increase our revenue, we expect to need significant additional financing to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under our debt agreements, as well as to maintain and expand our business. We may seek additional funds from public and private stock offerings, corporate collaborations and licenses, borrowings under lease lines of credit or other sources. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any additional equity financing may be significantly dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and bear high rates of interest. In addition, our existing loan agreements contain certain restrictive covenants that either limit our ability to, or require a mandatory prepayment if we incur additional indebtedness and liens and enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of our lenders or prepay the outstanding amounts under the debt agreements, which could require us to pay additional prepayment penalties. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We also may be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nCertain of our debt agreements also contain financial covenants, including maintaining minimum current, debt-to-worth and loan-to-value ratios and certain cash balance requirements, in addition to provisions providing for an event of default if there is a material adverse change in our financial condition and if we are in default under certain of our other agreements. While we are not currently in default under any of these agreements, and none of our lenders have previously declared an event of default on our indebtedness, prior to our recent receipt of waivers from our lenders, we had not been in compliance with certain of these covenants. In addition, if we fail to pay any principal or interest under our indebtedness when due, or are otherwise in violation of certain covenants under our debt agreements, this may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness.\nIf we cannot raise more money when needed, or are unable to use our future working capital, borrowings or equity financing to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under our debt agreements or to renegotiate our debt arrangements with lenders, we may have to reduce our capital expenditures, scale-back our development of new products, reduce our workforce or license to others products that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves. Any of these eventualities would likely have a material adverse impact on our value and the value of our equity. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenue from operations needed to stay in business, and we may be required to seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings. See Part II-Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nOur business may fail if we are not able to increase sales.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to significantly increase sales from the bio-based pest management products we have commercialized, both domestically and abroad. Our initial sales of our primary formulation of Regalia and our initial formulation of Grandevo occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. We began selling Zequanox in the second half of 2012, Venerate in May 2014 and Majestene in December 2015. However, while we have invested considerable resources in the launch of our products, various factors have impeded growth in sales of these products.\nFor example, we believe adverse conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry, including low commodity prices, may have reduced demand for our products. Further delays in regulatory approvals of certain of our products in Europe and other jurisdictions may slow international growth, and any delay in a product launch that causes us to miss a growing season may require us to wait a year to enter that market. The extended drought in California and other markets has reduced demand for our products as fewer acres are planted, changes in weather patterns in Florida resulted in a shortened bloom cycle for the citrus market and few pesticide and plant health products being used, and certain of our strategic collaborations have not resulted in significant increases in sales of Regalia outside of the Unites States. Due to our prioritization plan, we have not committed sufficient resources to Zequanox in order to market it full-scale, and our collaboration efforts with regard to this product may not result in increased sales. In addition, the departures of our former chief operating officer and significant members of our sales staff in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequent turnover in our sales and marketing department disrupted the 2014 launch of Venerate as well as growth in sales of our other commercialized products, including Regalia and Grandevo. Further, we believe that following the announcement of the matters relating to our recent restatement, some customers and potential customers were concerned about our reported investigation efforts, and therefore, were reluctant to do business with us until after we had reached a settlement with the SEC.\nLower than expected sales growth may result in an increase in write-offs and inventory obsolescence if we are not be able to use raw materials or sell finished goods before they expire, and may result in higher proportional operating expense levels, increases in our cost of product revenues and decreases in product margins as we are unable to manufacture products as efficiently at low volumes and underutilization of our Bangor, Michigan manufacturing facility results in increased relative overhead and operating costs in addition to decreased allocation of depreciation and other costs to production and inventory. If we are unable to establish a successful sales and marketing infrastructure internally and increase sales of our commercialized products, our financial results will be adversely affected, our available cash and ability to raise additional capital will decrease and our business may fail.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products and will need to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure.\nWe currently have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities. As of December 31, 2015, we employed 17 full-time equivalent sales and marketing personnel, 4 of which focus on technical support and demonstration and conducting field trials and 3 of which focus on marketing. Many of these sales personnel are recent hires following the departures in the third quarter of 2014 of our former chief operating officer, who led our sales and marketing teams, and significant members of our sales staff. These new personnel have required significant training to attain a high level of technical expertise and knowledge regarding the capabilities of our bio-based products compared with conventional chemical pest management products and techniques in order to educate growers and independent distributors on the uses and benefits of our products. We will need to further develop our sales and marketing capabilities and find partners in order to successfully increase sales of our commercially available products and to commercialize other products we are developing, which may involve substantial costs. We will also need to further expand our field development team to include more technical service activities to support sales. There can be no assurance that our specialists and other members of our sales and marketing team will successfully compete against the sales and marketing teams of our current and future competitors, many of which may have more established relationships with distributors and growers. Our inability to recruit, train and retain sales and marketing personnel, or their inability to effectively market and sell the products we are developing, could impair our ability to gain market acceptance of our products and cause our sales to suffer.\nIf we are unable to maintain and further establish successful relations with the third-party distributors that are our principal customers, or they do not focus adequate resources on selling our products or are unsuccessful in selling them to end users, sales of our products will be adversely affected.\nIn the United States, we rely on independent distributors of agrichemicals to distribute and assist us with the marketing and sale of Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate, Majestene and other products we are developing. We also intend to leverage these relationships to sell Bio-Tam 2.0 in California, Oregon, Washington and Arizona. These distributors are our principal customers, and revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and maintaining this sales and distribution channel. However, there can be no assurance that our distributors will be successful in selling our products to end users, or will focus adequate resources on selling them, and they may not continue to purchase or market our products for a number of reasons.\nFor example, many distributors lack experience in marketing bio-based pest management and plant health products, which generally must be used differently than conventional chemical pesticides. Distributors may not continue to market our products if they receive negative feedback from end users, even if we believe our products are being blamed for damage to treated plants caused by other pesticides with which our products have been combined (whether properly or improperly). In addition, many of our distributors are in the business of distributing and manufacturing other, possibly competing, pest management and plant health products, including internally developed and commercialized bio-based products as well as bio-based products developed by larger agrichemical companies that negotiate to \u201cbundle\u201d such specialty products with other high demand products. As a result, our distributors may earn higher margins by selling competing products or combinations of competing products. Our recent Audit Committee investigation, financial restatement and SEC investigation imposed additional work on our distributors, which has been perceived negatively in some cases, and distributors may also react negatively to additional \u201csell-through\u201d reporting requirements we may require of them to apply our own revenue recognition policies. If we are unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors, we will need to further develop our own sales and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time-consuming, and the success of which would be uncertain.\nThe product candidates we select for development and commercialization may fail to generate significant revenues, and we may not be able to successfully enter into strategic collaborations with respect to our other product candidates.\nWe have been implementing a prioritization plan that focuses our research and development on products that are expected to have the greatest near-term growth potential. Accordingly, we are currently limiting our internal efforts to four product candidates: MBI-010, a bioherbicide that is based on the microorganism in Venerate and Majestene, which we plan to submit to the EPA in late 2016 or early 2017; MBI-110, a biofungicide, which we submitted to the EPA in January 2016; Haven (MBI-505), a plant health product that does not require EPA registration; and MBI-601, a biopesticide that produces gaseous natural compounds, or \u201cbiofumigant,\u201d which we submitted to the EPA in April 2014. Simultaneously, we are seeking collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize more early stage candidates on which we have elected not to expend significant internal resources.\nSuccessful development of product candidates will require significant additional investment, including costs associated with research and development, completing field trials and obtaining regulatory approval, as well as the ability to manufacture our products in large quantities at acceptable costs while also preserving high product quality. Difficulties often encountered in scaling up production include problems involving production yields, quality control and assurance, shortage of qualified personnel, production costs and process controls. In addition, we are subject to inherent risks associated with new products and technologies. These risks include the possibility that any product candidate may:\n\u2022\nbe found unsafe;\n\u2022\nbe ineffective or less effective than anticipated;\n\u2022\nfail to receive or take longer to receive necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nbe difficult to competitively price relative to alternative pest management solutions;\n\u2022\nbe harmful to consumers, growers, farm workers or the environment;\n\u2022\nbe harmful to crops when used in connection with conventional chemical pesticides;\n\u2022\nbe difficult or impossible to manufacture on an economically viable scale;\n\u2022\nbe subject to supply chain constraints for raw materials;\n\u2022\nfail to be developed and accepted by the market prior to the successful marketing of similar products by competitors;\n\u2022\nbe impossible to market because it infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties; or\n\u2022\nbe too expensive for commercial use.\nOur decisions regarding which product candidates to pursue may cause us to fail to capitalize on product candidates that could have given rise to viable commercial products and profitable market opportunities. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into new arrangements with third parties, on favorable terms or at all, with respect to product candidates we do not pursue internally.\nAdverse weather conditions and other natural conditions can reduce acreage planted or incidence of crop disease or pest infestations, which can adversely affect our results of operations.\nProduction of the crops on which our products are typically applied is vulnerable to extreme weather conditions such as heavy rains, hurricanes, hail, tornadoes, freezing conditions, drought, fires and floods. Weather conditions can be impacted by climate change resulting from global warming, including changes in precipitation patterns and the increased frequency of extreme weather events, or other factors. Unfavorable weather conditions can reduce both acreage planted and incidence (or timing) of certain crop diseases or pest infestations, each of which may reduce demand for our products. For example, in 2013 and 2012, the United States experienced nationwide abnormally low rainfall or drought, reducing the incidence of fungal diseases such as mildews and the demand for fungicides such as Regalia. These conditions have been present in some of our key markets throughout both 2015 and 2014 as well, and have also resulted in further reductions in acreage planted throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. Shortened bloom cycles relating to changes in weather patterns also could reduce the amount of pesticides and plant health products used during a growing season. For example, in 2014, the Florida citrus market experienced a shortened bloom cycle as a result of changes in weather patterns, which negatively affected our sales of Grandevo in the Florida market. In addition, ideal weather conditions can reduce the incidence of diseases and pest infestations and increase yields without the use of additional pesticide and plant health applications. Increased yields can also reduce commodity prices causing growers to make a decision not to increase costs by reducing the amount of pesticides and plant health products used during a growing season. Since all of our products have different margins, changes in product mix as a result of these conditions could affect our overall margins.\nIf our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize, our products on a timely basis.\nThe successful completion of multiple field trials in domestic and foreign locations on various crops and water infrastructures is critical to the success of our product development and marketing efforts. If our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful or produce inconsistent results or unanticipated adverse side effects on crops or on non-target organisms, or if we are unable to collect reliable data, regulatory approval of our products could be delayed or we may be unable to commercialize our products. In addition, more than one growing or treatment season may be required to collect sufficient data and we may need to collect data from different geographies to prove performance for customer adoption. Although we have conducted successful field trials on a broad range of crops, we cannot be certain that additional field trials conducted on a greater number of acres, or on crops for which we have not yet conducted field trials, will be successful. Moreover, the results of our ongoing and future\nfield trials are subject to a number of conditions beyond our control, including weather-related events such as drought or floods, severe heat or frost, hail, tornadoes and hurricanes, or low or no natural occurrence of the pests intended for testing. Generally, we pay third parties, such as growers, consultants and universities, to conduct field tests on our behalf. Incompatible crop treatment practices or misapplication of our products by these third parties or lack of sufficient occurrence of the identified pests in nature for a particular trial could impair the success of our field trials.\nOur inability to obtain regulatory approvals, or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent sales of the products we are developing and commercializing.\nThe field testing, manufacture, sale and use of pest management products, including Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate, Majestene and other products we are developing, are extensively regulated by the EPA and state, local and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations substantially increase the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market. If we do not receive the necessary governmental approvals to test, manufacture and market our products, or if regulatory authorities revoke our approvals, do not grant approvals in a timely manner or grant approvals subject to restrictions on their use, we may be unable to sell our products in the United States or other jurisdictions, which could result in a reduction in our future revenues.\nWe have received approval from the EPA for the active ingredients and certain end product formulations for Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate, Majestene and MBI-011. As we introduce new formulations of and applications for our products, we will need to seek EPA approval prior to commercial sale. For any such approval, the EPA may require us to fulfill certain conditions within a specified period of time following initial approval. We are also required to obtain regulatory approval from other state and foreign regulatory authorities before we market our products in their jurisdictions, some of which have taken, and may take, longer than anticipated.\nSome of these states and foreign countries may apply different criteria than the EPA in their approval processes. Although federal pesticide law preempts separate state and local pesticide registration requirements to some extent, state and local governments retain authority to control pesticide use within their borders.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for marketing our additional products or new product formulations and applications we are developing. Although the EPA has in place a registration procedure for biopesticides like Regalia and Grandevo that is streamlined in comparison to the registration procedure for conventional chemical pesticides, there can be no assurance that all of our products or product extensions will be eligible for this streamlined procedure or that additional requirements will not be mandated by the EPA that could make the procedure more time consuming and costly for our future products.\nAdditionally, for California state registration and registration in jurisdictions outside of the United States, all products need to be proven efficacious for each proposed crop-pest combination, which can require costly field trial testing, and a favorable result is not assured. Because many of the products that may be sold by us must be registered with one or more government agencies, the registration process can be time consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that the product will obtain all required registrations. We have intentionally obtained registration in some jurisdictions and not in others. California is one of the largest and most important producers of agricultural products in the world. Because of its stringent regulation of pesticides and environmental focus, we also view California as one of the most natural and attractive markets for our products. However, California is also very stringent, is generally more time consuming and lacks legally mandated deadlines for its reviews of reduced-risk biopesticides. Therefore, gaining concurrent approvals with the EPA, other states and sometimes even other countries may not always be achievable. Even if we obtain all necessary regulatory approvals to market and sell our products, they will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements, including periodic re-registrations. The EPA, as well as state and foreign regulatory authorities, could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information, including an inability to comply with their regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products, or for other reasons.\nBio-based pest management and plant health products are not well understood, which necessitates investment in customer education and makes effectively marketing and selling our products difficult.\nThe market for bio-based pest management and plant health products is underdeveloped when compared to conventional pesticides. Customers in the crop production sector and the water treatment sector are generally cautious in their adoption of new products and technologies. Growers often require on-farm demonstrations of a given pest management or plant health product. Initial purchases of the product tend to be conservative, with the grower testing on a small portion of their overall crop. As the product is proven, growers incorporate the product into their rotational programs and deploy it on a greater percentage of their operations. As a result, large scale adoption generally takes several growing seasons. Water treatment products must also pass efficacy and ecological toxicity tests. In addition, given the relative novelty of our water treatment products, consumers of those products will continue to require education on their use, which may delay their adoption.\nIn addition, customers have historically perceived bio-based pest management products as more expensive and less effective than conventional chemical pesticides. To succeed, we will need to continue to change that perception. To the extent that the market for bio-based pest management products does not further develop or customers elect to continue to purchase and rely on conventional chemical pesticides, our market opportunity will be limited.\nThe high level of competition in the market for pest management and plant health products may result in pricing pressure, reduced margins or the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance.\nThe markets for pest management and plant health products are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and undergoing consolidation. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins and the inability to achieve market acceptance for our products.\nMany entities are engaged in developing pest management and plant health products. Our competitors include major multinational agrichemical companies such as Arysta, BASF, Bayer, Dow Agrosciences, DuPont, FMC, Monsanto, Sumitomo Chemical and Syngenta, some of which have developed bio-based products for our target markets, as well as specialized bio-based pesticide and plant health businesses such as AgraQuest (now a part of Bayer), Certis USA (now a part of Mitsui), Novozymes (in a joint venture with Monsanto) and Valent Biosciences (now a part of Sumitomo). Many of these organizations have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater brand recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the manufacture, promotion or sale of their products, receive greater resources and support from independent distributors, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or more readily take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities. Further, many of the large agrichemical companies have a more diversified product offering than we do, which may give these companies an advantage in meeting customers\u2019 needs by enabling them to offer a broader range of pest management and plant health solutions. In addition, we could face competition in the future from new, well-financed start-up companies such as AgBiome and Indigo.\nOur product sales are subject to weather conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly quarterly and annually.\nThe level of seasonality in our business overall is difficult to evaluate as a result of our relatively early stage of development, our relatively limited number of commercialized products, our expansion into new geographical territories, the introduction of new products, the timing of introductions of new formulations and products and our recognition of revenue on both a \u201csell-in\u201d and \u201csell-through\u201d basis, depending on the transaction. It is possible that our business may become more seasonal, or experience seasonality in different periods, than anticipated, particularly if we expand into new geographical territories, add or change distributors or distributor programs or introduce new products with different applicable growing seasons, or if a more significant component of our revenue becomes comprised of sales of Zequanox, which has a separate seasonal sales cycle compared to our crop protection products.\nNotwithstanding any such seasonality, we expect substantial fluctuation in sales year over year and quarter over quarter as a result of a number of variables on which sales of our products are dependent. Weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors affect planting and growing seasons and incidence of pests and plant disease, and accordingly affect decisions by our distributors, direct customers and end users about the types and amounts of pest management and plant health products to purchase and the timing of use of such products. In addition, disruptions that cause delays by growers in harvesting or planting can result in the movement of orders to a future quarter, which would negatively affect the quarter and cause fluctuations in our operating results. For example, late snows and cold temperatures in the Midwestern and Eastern United States in the first and second quarters of 2014 delayed planting and pesticide and plant health applications. Customers also may purchase large quantities of our products in a particular quarter to store and use over long periods of time or time their purchases to manage their inventories, which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular quarter or year, and low commodity prices may discourage growers from purchasing our products in an effort to reduce their costs and increase their margins for a growing season.\nOur expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future sales. As a result, any shortfall in sales relative to our expectations could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter, which could result in uncertainty surrounding our level of earnings and possibly a decrease in our stock price.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel, and if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel, our development and commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed.\nWe depend heavily on the principal members of our management, particularly Pamela G. Marrone, Ph.D., our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives. Although we maintain and are the beneficiary of $10.0 million in key person life insurance policies for the life of Dr. Marrone, we do not believe the proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for her loss.\nWe have a lean staff, and rely on qualified sales and marketing, research and development and management personnel to succeed. For example, the departures of our former chief operating officer and significant members of our sales staff in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequent turnover in our sales and marketing department adversely impacted our business by disrupting the 2014 launch of Venerate as well as the growth in sales of our other commercialized products, including Regalia and Grandevo. The process of hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is lengthy and expensive. The market for qualified personnel, such as experienced fermentation engineers and formulation chemists, is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products, and few sales and marketing personnel have prior experience with bio-based products. Perceived instability and risk in our business has made it difficult to retain qualified personnel and could impair our ability to meet our business objectives and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to produce our products at a satisfactory quality, in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe have transitioned the majority of our manufacturing processes in-house to our facility in Bangor, Michigan. If severe weather, a fire or natural disaster occurs, a contaminant grows in our fermentations, or a mechanical or labor problem leads to a reduced capacity or shutdown of our fermenters or other equipment, we may not be successful in producing the amount and quality of product we anticipate in the facility and our results of operations may suffer as a result.\nWe also continue to rely on third parties to formulate Grandevo and Zequanox into spray-dried powders and for all of our production of Venerate and Majestene, and from time to time, we expect to use third-party manufacturers for supplemental production capacity to meet excess seasonal demand and for packaging. Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our products presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedules, yields and product reliability;\n\u2022\nprice increases;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing deviations from internal and regulatory specifications;\n\u2022\nthe failure of a key manufacturer to perform its obligations to us for technical, market or other reasons;\n\u2022\nchallenges presented by introducing our fermentation processes to new manufacturers or deploying them in new facilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing additional manufacturers if we are presented with the need to transfer our manufacturing process technologies to them;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nother risks in potentially meeting our product commercialization schedule or satisfying the requirements of our distributors, direct customers and end users.\nWe have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply agreements for any of our products, and we may need to enter into additional agreements for the commercial development, manufacturing and sale of our products. There can be no assurance that we can do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur products have been produced in quantities sufficient to meet commercial demand. However, our dependence upon others for the production of a portion of our products, or for a portion of the manufacturing process, particularly for drying, may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products on a timely and competitive basis. If manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, and our net revenues and results of operations could decline.\nWe must accurately forecast demand for our products to obtain adequate and cost-effective capacity from our third-party manufacturers and to purchase certain of the raw materials used in our products at cost-effective rates. Our third-party manufacturers are not required to supply us products until we place and they accept our purchase orders, which generally occurs approximately one month prior to the anticipated product delivery date based on our own rolling forecasts. Our purchase orders may not be accepted and our third-party manufacturers may not be willing to provide us with additional products on a timely basis if they prioritize orders placed by other companies, many of whom are more established than us and order larger volumes of products. In addition, while raw material orders are generally placed one month in advance, because certain of the raw materials used in our products are in short supply or are subject to capacity demands, we place some raw material orders approximately six months in advance to avoid paying higher prices. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories of products and raw materials.\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our operating results.\nLow yields may result from product design, development stage or process technology failures. We do not know whether a yield problem exists until our products are manufactured based on our design. When a yield issue is identified, the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause. As a result, yield deficiencies may not be identified until well into the production process. We may experience inability to ramp up yields in our own manufacturing facility. In the event that we continue to rely on third-party manufacturers, resolution of yield problems requires cooperation among, and communication between, us and our manufacturers. We have limited experience producing a number of our products at commercial scale, and we will not succeed if we cannot maintain or decrease our production costs and effectively scale our technology and manufacturing processes.\nWe rely on a single supplier based in China for a key ingredient of Regalia.\nThe active ingredient in our Regalia product line is derived from the giant knotweed plant, which we obtain from China. Our single supplier acquires raw knotweed from numerous regional sources and performs an extraction process on this plant, creating a dried extract that is shipped to our third-party manufacturer in the United States. Although we have identified additional sources of knotweed that appear to be reliable and of appropriate quality, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain dried extract from China at a competitive price point.\nOther ingredients used in the manufacturing of our products are also sourced from a limited number of suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain such ingredients reliably and of appropriate quality at a competitive price point.\nOur Zequanox product line requires additional development to become profitable, and our collaborative efforts on this product may not result in increased sales or gross margins.\nOur Zequanox product line is principally designed to control invasive mussels that restrict critical water flow in industrial and power facilities and impinge on access to recreational waters. Although Zequanox requires additional development to become profitable, due to our prioritization plan, we have not committed sufficient resources to this product in order to market it full-scale and substantially improve gross margins. Our ability to generate significant revenues from Zequanox has been dependent on our ability to persuade customers to evaluate the costs of our Zequanox products compared to the overall cost of the chlorine treatment process, the primary current alternative to using Zequanox, rather than the cost of purchasing chemicals alone. Sales of Zequanox have also remained lower than our other products due to the length of the treatment cycle, the longer sales cycle (the bidding process with utility companies and government agencies occurs on a yearly or multi-year basis) and the unique nature of the treatment approach for each customer based on the extent of the infestation and the design of the facility. We expect our near-term sales of Zequanox will continue to be to governmental agencies and regulated industries, which typically take longer to negotiate and approve contracts than the private sector. Further, we currently expect that our governmental sales may be subject to bidding procedures as well as uncertainties surrounding these agencies\u2019 budget approval processes. We are pursuing partnerships to assist us in further developing Zequanox and expanding it commercially, but we may be unsuccessful in securing and maintaining collaboration efforts with regard to this product, and any such efforts may not result in increased sales or gross margins.\nWe depend on a limited number of distributors.\nOur current revenues are derived from a limited number of key customers, each of which serves as a third-party distributor to our products\u2019 end users. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our top two distributors accounted for 38% and 43% of our total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our top distributor accounted for 20% of our total revenues. We expect a limited number of distributors to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. The loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of our significant distributors could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decline in U.S. agricultural production could have a material adverse effect on the market for pesticides and on our results of operations and financial position.\nConditions in the U.S. agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry has contracted in recent periods, and can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. State and federal governmental policies, including farm subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of\nfertilizer products and the prices at which produce may be sold, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of pesticides for particular agricultural applications. There are various proposals pending before the U.S. Congress to cut or eliminate various agricultural subsidies. If such proposals are implemented, they may adversely impact the U.S. agricultural industry and suppliers to that industry such as us.\nOur intellectual property is integral to our business. If we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the United States and foreign countries, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protection for our technologies and products in the United States and other countries. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. As of December 31, 2015, we had 25 issued U.S. patents and 87 issued foreign patents (of which 5 U.S. patents and 37 foreign patents were in-licensed), 29 pending provisional and non-provisional U.S. patent applications (of which one was in-licensed) and 179 pending foreign patent applications (of which 5 were in-licensed).\nThe patent position of biotechnology and biochemical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States provide additional procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents, some of which allow a lower evidentiary standard to hold a patent claim invalid. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems and costs in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countries.\nOur patents, and those patents for which we have license rights, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage. We are not certain that our pending patent applications will be issued. Moreover, our competitors could challenge or circumvent our patents or pending patent applications. It is also not possible to patent and protect all knowledge and know-how associated with our products, so there may be areas that are not protected such as certain formulations and manufacturing processes. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nFor certain of our products, we hold co-exclusive licenses to certain of the intellectual property related to these products. Although our products that are derived from intellectual property licensed to us on a co-exclusive basis also include our own proprietary technology, the third parties with whom we share co-exclusive rights may develop products based on the same underlying intellectual property. This could adversely affect the sale of our products.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and third-party manufacturers. It is possible that these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not make us whole. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. We generally control and limit access to, and the distribution of, our product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect these proprietary rights, our trade secret-protected know-how could fall into the public domain, and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We also cannot guarantee that other parties will not independently develop our knowhow or otherwise obtain access to our technologies.\nThird parties may misappropriate our microbial strains.\nThird parties, including contract manufacturers, often have custody or control of our microbial strains. If our microbial strains were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce the microbial strains for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge and prevent this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment such as ours in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. Patents issued to third parties may contain claims that conflict with our patents and that may place restrictions on the commercial viability of our products and technologies. Third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products, product candidates and technology. We may not be aware of all such third-party intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our products and product candidates.\nAny litigation, adversarial proceeding or proceeding before governmental authorities regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of its outcome, would probably be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel. Litigation, adversarial proceedings or proceedings before governmental authorities could also force us to:\n\u2022\nstop or delay using our proprietary screening technology;\n\u2022\nstop or delay selling, manufacturing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay damages; and/or\n\u2022\nenter into licensing or royalty agreements which, if available at all, may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nClaims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and are subject to potential liability under environmental laws. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, disposal and release of hazardous materials and certain waste products. Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and biological waste. Some of these materials may be novel, including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any injury resulting from these materials. In addition, although we have not currently identified any environmental liabilities, the manufacturing facility we purchased in July 2012 may have existing environmental liabilities associated with it that may also result in successor liabilities for us, and we will be subject to increased exposure to potential environmental liabilities as we manufacture our products on a larger scale. We may also be held liable for hazardous materials brought onto the premises of our manufacturing facility before we acquired title, without regard for fault for, or knowledge of, the presence of such substances, as well as for hazardous materials that may be discovered after we no longer own the property if we sell it in the future. In the event of an accident, or if any hazardous materials are found within our operations or on the premises of our manufacturing facility in violation of the law at any time, we may be liable for all cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other costs. This liability could exceed our resources, and, if significant losses arise from hazardous substance contamination, our financial viability may be substantially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the impact of new governmental regulations that might have an adverse effect on the research, development, production and marketing of our products. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations. Our business may be harmed by the cost of compliance.\nOur collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts. To our knowledge, their work is performed in accordance with applicable biosafety regulations. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, however, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, hazardous materials used by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.\nOur headquarters and other facilities and certain manufacturers and suppliers are located in regions that are subject to natural disasters, as well as in some cases geopolitical risks and social upheaval.\nOur Davis, California headquarters is located near a known earthquake fault. The impact of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, including floods, on our Davis facilities, Bangor, Michigan manufacturing plant, infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and any natural disaster could seriously disrupt our entire business process. In addition, Regalia is produced by a third-party manufacturer in Florida in a location that could be impacted by hurricane activity, and certain of our raw materials are sourced in China, which is subject to risks associated with uncertain political, economic and other conditions such as the outbreak of contagious diseases, such as avian flu, swine flu and SARS, and natural disasters. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from natural disasters or other business interruptions. Although these risks have not materially adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, there can be no assurance that such risks will not do so in the future.\nInability to comply with regulations applicable to our facilities and procedures could delay, limit or prevent our research and development or manufacturing activities.\nOur research and development and manufacturing facilities and procedures are subject to continual review and periodic inspection. We must spend funds, time and effort in the areas of production, safety and quality control and assurance to ensure full technical compliance with the regulations applicable to these facilities and procedures. If the EPA or another regulatory body determines that we are not in compliance with these regulations, regulatory approval of our products could be delayed or we may be required to limit or cease our research and development or manufacturing activities or pay a monetary fine. If we are required to limit or cease our research and development activities, our ability to develop new products would be impaired. In addition, if we are required to limit or cease our manufacturing activities, our ability to produce our products in commercial quantities would be impaired or prohibited, which would harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to product liability and remediation claims, which could harm our business.\nThe use of certain bio-based pest management and plant health products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations, we cannot provide assurance that our products will not cause injury to crops, the environment or people under all circumstances. For example, our products may be improperly combined with other pesticides or, even when properly combined, our products may be blamed for damage caused by these other pesticides. The costs of remediation or products liability could materially adversely affect our future quarterly or annual operating results.\nWe may be held liable for, or incur costs to settle, liability and remediation claims if any products we develop, or any products that use or incorporate any of our technologies, cause injury or are found unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or use. These risks exist even with respect to products that have received, or may in the future receive, regulatory approval, registration or clearance for commercial use. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid product liability exposure.\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance at levels we believe are sufficient and consistent with industry standards for companies at our stage of development. We cannot guarantee that our product liability insurance is adequate and, at any time, it is possible that this insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. A product liability claim could result in liability to us greater than our assets or insurance coverage. Moreover, even if we have adequate insurance coverage, product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to those matters, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $166.4 million of federal and $146.4 million of state operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2026 for federal and 2016 for state purposes if unused. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these loss carryforwards before their expiration.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses, as well as certain recognized built-in losses and other carryforwards, after an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could also result in an ownership change under Section 382. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-change net operating losses and other losses we can use to reduce our taxable income generally equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d (subject to certain adjustments) and the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate for the month of the \u201cownership change.\u201d The applicable rate for ownership changes occurring in the month of December 2015 was 2.61%.\nBecause U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to 20 years, the annual limitation may effectively provide a cap on the cumulative amount of pre-ownership change losses, including certain recognized built-in losses that may be utilized. Such pre-ownership change losses in excess of the cap may be lost. In addition, if an ownership change were to occur, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses and certain recognized built-in losses could cause a net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. Further, if the amount or value of these deferred tax assets is reduced, such reduction would have a negative impact on the book value of our common stock.\nWe completed a Section 382 analysis as of December 31, 2013 and concluded that approximately $0.5 million in federal net operating losses and approximately $0.2 million in federal research and development credits are expected to expire prior to utilization as a result of our previous ownership changes and corresponding annual limitations. We have not conducted an analysis to determine the amount of state net operating losses that are also expected to expire prior to utilization. Our existing net operating loss carryforwards or credits may be subject to significant limitations due to events occurring since December 31, 2013, and we have not updated our Section 382 analysis to consider events since December 31, 2013, including the effect of issuing common stock pursuant to a public offering in June 2014. Our inability to use these net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the Section 382 limitations could harm our financial condition.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements has been time consuming and expensive, and matters relating to or arising from the restatement and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers and prospective customers, regulatory inquiries and litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or stock price.\nOn November 10, 2015, we filed an Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 that included restated consolidated financial statements, selected financial data (as applicable), certain financial data in management\u2019s discussion and analysis and other information for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, including related quarterly periods, and the quarterly periods ended March 31 and June 30, 2014. The restatement principally related to determinations by our Audit Committee in February 2015, following the completion of its independent investigation announced in September 2014, that as a result of the failure of certain employees to share with our finance department or our external auditors important transaction terms with distributors,\nincluding \u201cinventory protection\u201d arrangements that would permit the distributors to return to us certain unsold products, we had incorrectly recognized revenue for certain historical sales transactions with these distributors prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nAs further described in Part I-Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, we, our current and former executive officers and members of our board of directors have been named as defendants in various lawsuits asserting claims arising out of the subject matter of the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation. If we do not prevail in the pending legal proceedings or any other litigation, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage, or may have additional penalties or other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, under Delaware law, our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify certain current and former officers and directors in relation to these proceedings and actions. Such indemnification may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition to the extent insurance does not cover our costs. In addition, we may not have sufficient coverage under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies, in which case our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have incurred over $15.3 million in legal, accounting and other professional fees and costs in connection with the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation, financial restatement and related matters (including remediation efforts, NASDAQ matters, responding to and settling an SEC investigation and the pending legal proceedings), net of insurance proceeds. Our board of directors, management and other key employees have expended, and may continue to expend, a substantial amount of time related to these matters, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFurther, we have been and may continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the financial restatement and related matters, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from our stockholders, creditors or others with which we do business. We believe this negative publicity has impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors, and may continue to do so in the future. Concerns include the perception of the work effort required to address our accounting and control environment, the ability for us to be a long-term provider to customers and our ability to timely pay outstanding balances to vendors. Moreover, we believe that our competitors have sought and will continue to seek to leverage the financial restatement and related matters to try and raise concerns about us in the minds of our customers and prospective customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and reputation and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which could subject us to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe complex legal and regulatory environment exposes us to compliance and litigation costs and risks that could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events. They include environmental laws and regulations, tax laws and regulations, import and export laws and regulations, government contracting laws and regulations, labor and employment laws and regulations, securities and exchange laws and regulations, and other laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, proposed laws and regulations in these and other areas could affect the cost of our business operations. We face the risk of changes in both domestic and foreign laws regarding trade, potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or foreign laws that may be less\nprotective of our intellectual property rights. Violations of any of these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price has, in the past, and may, in the future, not meet the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) and the minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market.\nAs previously reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2016, on January 13, 2016, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the Company\u2019s MVLS had closed below the minimum $50.0 million requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Global Market, set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until July 6, 2016, to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). Compliance can be achieved automatically and without further action if the Company\u2019s MVLS closes at $50.0 million or more for at least 10 consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day grace period.\nAt the expiration of the 180-day grace period, we may request a hearing to remain on the NASDAQ Global Market. If we do not regain compliance by the end of the 180-day grace period or are not granted a hearing, NASDAQ will notify us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. Alternatively, if we do not regain compliance by the expiration of the grace period, we may transfer the listing of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market, provided that we meet the applicable requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market based on our public filings and market information at that time.\nIn addition, as subsequently reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2016, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the Company\u2019s MVPHS had closed below the minimum $15.0 million requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C). In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company was afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C). On March 9, 2016, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we had regained compliance as a result of the Company\u2019s MVPHS closing at $15.0 million or more for 10 consecutive trading days during the 180-day grace period.\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain or regain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market, that our common stock would be eligible for transfer to the NASDAQ Capital Market and remain in compliance with the requirements for listing on that market or that we would be granted a hearing. Delisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur principal stockholders will have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of approximately 3.0 million shares, or 12.0% of our common stock. In addition, affiliates of Waddell & Reed Financial Inc., which beneficially own 19.99% of our common stock, hold $40.0 million of principal in senior secured promissory notes issued in August 2015. If all of these\nsecurity holders act together, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs, which could result in some corporate actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial such as failure to approve change of control transactions that could offer holders of our common stock a premium over the market value of our company. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nWe are an early stage company with a limited trading history and a history of losses. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in August 2013 at a price of $12.00 per share, our stock price has ranged between $1.00 and $20.00 through December 31, 2015. The trading price of our common stock will likely continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation, the financial restatement and the SEC investigation and lawsuits arising out of related matters;\n\u2022\nour small public float relative to the total number of shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, those of our competitors or those of our customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or services or new commercial relationships by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our operations;\n\u2022\nmedia reports and publications about pest management products;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the pest management industry in general;\n\u2022\nour entry into, modification of or termination of key license, research and development or collaborative agreements;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines or the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nthe commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates, including our ability to meet our future net revenues and operating profit or loss projections; and\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 24.5 million shares of common stock outstanding, 2.2 million which were held by our directors and officers and their affiliates and an additional 12.0 million shares which were held by other beneficial holders of 5% or more of our common stock. Although these shares are subject in some cases to volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, any determination by holders of a substantial number of such\nshares to sell our stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 we had 2.5 million shares of our common stock either issued or available for issuance under our equity incentive plans. These shares may be sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging public companies, which include, among other things:\n\u2022\nexemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u2022\nexemption from the requirements of holding non-binding stockholder votes on executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u2022\nexemption from any rules requiring mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis and, unless the SEC otherwise determines, any future audit rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nWe could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary after our initial public offering, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the date on which we have, during the previous three year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the federal securities laws. We will qualify as a large accelerated filer as of the first day of the first fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700.0 million in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates and (ii) been public for at least 12 months. The value of our outstanding common equity will be measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are also permitted to elect to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards until companies that are not subject to periodic reporting obligations are required to comply, if such accounting standards apply with non-reporting companies. We have made an irrevocable decision to opt out of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which costs will increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. Such costs will increase after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company. Our management and other personnel have needed to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives, and our legal and accounting compliance costs have increased. We also may need to hire additional staff or consultants in the areas of investor relations, legal and accounting to continue to operate as a public company. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. Greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies. We also expect that, as a public company, it will continue to be expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, as a public company, we are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As described above, as an emerging growth company, we are not yet required to comply with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404. However, we are required to comply with management attestations of Section 404, and our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. We expect to incur substantial accounting expense and management time on compliance-related issues with respect to Section 404. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nFor example, in September 2014, our Audit Committee initiated an independent investigation regarding certain accounting matters concerning recognition of revenue in a sales transaction. As a result of the matters relating to the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation, we announced that certain of our previously filed financial statements could no longer be relied upon and subsequently completed a restatement. While we believe we have appropriately determined the errors made in our previously reported consolidated financial statements, recorded the correct adjustments in preparing our restated consolidated financial statements and remediated the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting related to the subject matter of the Audit Committee\u2019s independent investigation, we can provide no assurances that other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, such as the material weakness we have identified with respect to stock option grants, will not be identified in the future.\nWe have in the past identified material weaknesses, and if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to ensure that information regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As discussed under Part II-Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, based on the Audit Committee\u2019s independent\ninvestigation, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 resulting in revenue transactions that were recognized prior to satisfaction of all required revenue recognition criteria. These include material weaknesses related to our process for recognizing revenue relating to certain former sales personnel who did not conduct their duties with the requisite level of integrity and control consciousness, leading to insufficient attention to their responsibilities and internal controls, without management having implemented mitigating controls to discourage, prevent or detect override of internal control by those personnel. In addition, it was determined that our internal controls were not effectively designed to identify instances when sales personnel made unauthorized commitments with certain distributors. We developed and implemented a plan to remediate these material weaknesses, which focuses on continued training for and communication with employees regarding our enhanced policies and procedures, and have determined that these material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2015.\nAlso in connection with management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, management identified an additional deficiency that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 in our governance practices related to ineffective controls over the timeliness and accuracy of documentation related to actions of our board of directors and compensation committee specific to approving stock option grants. While no financial statement accounts or disclosures were misstated, the potential impact could have led to a material misstatement. We developed and implemented a plan to conduct training with our legal department and those charged with governance to ensure that board and compensation committee minutes are prepared in a more timely and accurate manner and are reviewed with sufficient rigor to ensure the minutes fully and accurately reflect the actions and approvals related to stock option grants and have determined that this material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2015.\nRemedying our material weaknesses has required substantial management time and attention, and ensuring that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis will continue to be a costly and time consuming effort. Any failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting or to complete and maintain the remediation of our identified control deficiencies may result in additional errors, material misstatements or delays in our financial reporting, failure to meet our financial reporting obligations or failure to avoid or detect fraud in our financial reporting. This in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock and our relationships with customers and suppliers.\nOur management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will have been detected. As discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Audit Committee and management have identified control deficiencies in the past and may identify additional deficiencies in the future.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that only a subset of the members of our board of directors be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in our election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of our common stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to repeal or adopt any provision of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least 80% of such shares to amend or repeal the provisions of our bylaws regarding the election and classification of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove directors without cause.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its common stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.", "PERMNO": 14099, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "MBII"}
