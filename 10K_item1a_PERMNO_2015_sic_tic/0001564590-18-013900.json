{"cik": "1554875", "company": "Tintri, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-05-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have limited working capital and a history of losses that raise substantial doubts as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements and the entirety of this Annual Report on Form 10-K on the basis that we would continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our inception and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm issued by KPMG LLP, or KPMG, with respect to the accompanying financial statements includes an explanatory note concerning our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not currently have any borrowing capacity available under our credit facility with TriplePoint Capital LLC, or TriplePoint, or our revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB. If we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations or if we have insufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, we may have to seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, undertake additional restructuring plans, reduce or delay capital expenditures, file for bankruptcy protection, wind down our or sell our business or sell certain of our assets or operations.\nWe need to raise additional financing to continue our operations and to remain in compliance with financial covenants under our credit facilities.\nSince the amendment to the terms of our credit agreements with our lenders, we have revised our forecasts of our cash flows and liquidity position for forward periods, casting additional doubt around our ability to meet our debt covenants. There can be no assurance that our lenders will not seek to demand immediate payment of amounts due under the relevant agreements as a result of the revisions to our forecasts. Based on our current forecasts, we will likely fail to satisfy the minimum liquidity covenants of our credit facilities as early as the end of May 2018, which would constitute an event of default under those facilities and enable our lenders to demand immediate payment of all amounts due under those facilities. Therefore, we will need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the immediate term in order to continue our operations and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facilities or to obtain relief from our lenders. Our inability to satisfy the minimum liquidity covenants of our credit facilities would constitute an event of default under those facilities and enable our lenders to demand immediate payment of all amounts due under those facilities. We do not currently have the\nability to repay these amounts. Further, regardless of whether these amounts become immediately due and payable, we likely do not have sufficient liquidity to continue our operations beyond June 30, 2018.\nOur management team\u2019s efforts to secure additional financing may divert their attention from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to sell and market our products or to develop new and enhanced solutions. Our existing and any future debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of any future securities offerings by us reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest. In the meantime, the prospect that we may have to cease or significantly curtail our operations will adversely impact our sales, operations, ability to retain employees and other aspects of our business. We are currently actively seeking additional sources of financing and considering various alternatives for the company including the potential sale of the company, but cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all, or sell the company at a price that will provide any meaningful proceeds to our stockholders, if at all. If we cannot raise additional financing we will need to reduce or curtail our operations and may need to wind down the company, potentially through bankruptcy. In the event of a bankruptcy, common stockholders are unlikely to receive any recovery of their interest in the company.\nWe will likely not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations to TriplePoint and SVB depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, interest, and other fees on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may have to seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, undertake additional restructuring plans, reduce or delay capital expenditures, file for bankruptcy protection, wind down our business, or sell our business or our certain of our assets or operations. We cannot assure you which course or courses we will pursue, whether we will be able to take certain of these actions, or whether these actions will enable us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event of our breach of revolving line of credit with SVB or our credit facility with TriplePoint, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets. Any failure to satisfy our commitments under our indebtedness could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred losses in all fiscal years since our inception, and we expect that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We experienced net losses of $101.0 million, $105.8 million, and $157.7 million in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. As of January 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $476.6 million. While currently uncertain, if we were to continue to grow, it is possible our operating expenses could increase over time, particularly in the medium to long term, for example in the event we were to hire additional employees, develop our technology and enhance our product and service offerings, expand our sales and marketing teams, make investments in our distribution channels and expand our operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset higher expenses, or at all. Revenue growth is likely to continue to slow or may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our products or services, concerns of existing and potential customers and suppliers regarding our financial condition, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or a failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Furthermore, it is likely we will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash from operations or other sources to adequately fund our business plan, which would negatively impact our revenue levels. As a result, and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties facing us, it is difficult to predict the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability, if at all. Any failure to become and remain profitable may require us to undertake a review of the potential business alternatives discussed above.\nWe have incurred indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, to protect and enforce our intellectual property and to meet other needs.\nWe have entered into a revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and a $50.0 million credit facility with TriplePoint Capital LLC, or TriplePoint. These facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets and intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2018, we had $19.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding under the SVB line of credit and $50.0 million under the TriplePoint credit facility. These facilities contain various covenants and specify various events of default, including a \u201ccross default\u201d provision that provides that, if there is an event of default that has not been cured or waived within any applicable grace period under one lender\u2019s debt facility, there is an event of default under the other lender\u2019s debt facility, upon which, at each lender\u2019s option, all amounts outstanding under each lender\u2019s applicable facility would become immediately due and payable and further advances under the facility would not be available to us.\nIn April 2018, we entered into agreements with each of SVB and TriplePoint to amend the terms of our credit agreements with these lenders. After giving effect to this amendment with SVB, our agreement with SVB allows us to borrow, through May 2, 2019, up to $12.5 million dependent upon our qualifying monthly accounts receivables balances. Our revolving line of credit with SVB contains certain financial covenants, including a covenant that we achieve total revenues of at least $20.5 million, $23.4 million, $26.3 million and $29.4 million for our fiscal quarters ending April 30, 2018, July 31, 2018, October 31, 2018 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and a covenant that we maintain a minimum level of cash and availability under the SVB line of credit of at least $15.0 million through July 31, 2018 and at least $10.0 million thereafter. After giving effect to this amendment with TriplePoint, $50.0 million of borrowings under the TriplePoint credit facility will become due in August 2019. However, we may extend the maturity date of $25.0 million of such indebtedness to February 2021, subject to certain conditions, including us making equal monthly amortizing payments of principal and interest through the extended maturity date.\nIf we were to fail to comply with any of the financial or other covenants contained in our agreements with SVB or TriplePoint and either lender chose to declare an event of default, the debt outstanding under the relevant agreements would become immediately due and payable. We do not at present, and may not in the future, have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under its debt facilities should they become immediately due and payable. Moreover, any required repayment of our existing indebtedness as a result of an event of default would reduce our cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Based on our assessment, it is probable that we will be unable to comply with our financial covenants through May 17, 2019, and we will likely fail to comply with our minimum liquidity covenants as early as May 31, 2018. Although we are seeking to raise additional debt or equity financing in order to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facilities, we may be unable to do so. As a result, we are currently undertaking a review of the potential business alternatives in addition to seeking additional capital, which may include restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, undertaking additional restructuring plans, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, filing for bankruptcy protection, winding down our business, or selling our business or certain of our assets or operations.\nIn March 2018, we entered into a Waiver and Tenth Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement, or the Tenth Amendment, with SVB, pursuant to which the parties agreed to certain amendments and modifications to our line of credit with SVB. The Tenth Amendment provides that the interest rate on amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit with SVB shall be equal to the prime rate plus 1.85% per annum through March 31, 2018, after which the interest rate returns to the prime rate plus 0.35% when we are borrowing base eligible and the prime rate plus 1.75% at all other times, and for the waiver by SVB with respect to certain prior breaches of financial covenants and related defaults, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Tenth Amendment.\nIn May 2017, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with certain of our preferred stockholders pursuant to which such stockholders agreed to purchase from us, at our election, one or more subordinated convertible promissory notes, or Notes, having an aggregate maximum principal amount of $25.0 million. In June 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement. As of January 31, 2018, no Notes were issued and sold under the Note Purchase Agreement. In February and March 2018, we issued an aggregate of $25.0 million of convertible promissory notes under the Note Purchase Agreement. The notes bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum and mature in August 2019.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and exposes our business to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nWe were founded in June 2008 and began selling our solution and generating revenue in 2011. We have a limited operating history in an industry characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, intense competition, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. All of these factors, as well as the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, make our future operating results difficult to predict, which may impair our ability to manage our business and reduce your ability to assess our prospects.\nWe have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. Our limited operating history makes it more difficult for us to predict these risks and uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our operating and financial results could differ from our expectations, and our business and prospects could suffer.\nOur historic revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future performance and have declined significantly in recent periods.\nWe experienced significant growth in prior periods. Revenue increased from $86.0 million in fiscal 2016 to $125.1 million in fiscal 2017, representing period-over-period growth of 45%. Revenue increased from $125.1 million in fiscal 2017 to $125.9 million in fiscal 2018, representing period-over-period growth of 1% and a significant reduction in our growth-rate compared to prior periods. Revenue increased $14.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the first half of fiscal 2017, which was offset by a $14.0 million decrease in revenue in the second half of fiscal 2018 compared to the second half of fiscal 2017. If we are able to achieve greater revenue scale, we may not be able to maintain revenue growth rates consistent with historical growth rates. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our revenue or revenue growth for any future period.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. If our revenue or operating results in any particular period fall below investor expectations, the price of our common stock would likely decline. Factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of orders and shipments of our products in any quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new and retain existing customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase and maintain sales coverage and effectiveness, including to retain and attract sales, marketing, engineering and other employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in our executive management team, sales organization and other business units;\n\u2022\nthe impact of recent changes in our executive management team and restructuring actions on our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with the financial covenants and other terms contained in our credit agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell additional products to our existing customers;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our sales channels or termination of our relationship with important distributors, channel partners, OEMs, contract manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nour seasonal sales cycles;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our solution;\n\u2022\nthe mix of solutions sold and the mix between product revenue and support and maintenance revenue;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introductions of plans of new products and our ability to manufacture and sell new products;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenses to grow our business;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition for our sales;\n\u2022\nregulatory, tax, accounting and other changes in requirements or policies applicable to us;\n\u2022\nvolatility in our share price, which may lead to higher stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022\ngeneral socioeconomic and political conditions in the countries where we operate or where our solution is sold or used.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet such expectations, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur growth depends in part on our ability to attract new customers and sell additional solutions and renewals to existing customers.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to increase sales of our solution to new customers domestically and internationally, as well as to increase sales of additional solutions and renewals to our existing customers. The rate at which new and existing customers purchase solutions depends on a number of factors, including customers\u2019 perceived need for enterprise cloud infrastructure solutions, general economic conditions, our ability to compete effectively with our competitors, spending levels on IT infrastructure solutions and other factors outside of our control. We may also be forced to engage in sophisticated and costly sales efforts, which may not result in additional sales.\nFurthermore, the rate at which our customers purchase enterprise cloud infrastructure solutions may be impacted by customers\u2019 concerns about the ongoing viability of our business. Following our IPO during fiscal 2018, we observed that some customers reduced or delayed purchases of our systems due to concerns about our financial condition and prospects.\nThe Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm issued by KPMG with respect to the accompanying financial statements includes an explanatory note concerning our ability to continue as a going concern, which we believe could create further concerns among our customers and suppliers and potential customers or suppliers concerning our financial condition and prospects, and could impact future order rates and levels.\nWe provide our support services under limited term contracts, which range from one to five years. Our customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our solution, our customer support and increased competition and the pricing of our, or competing, services. Even if our customers choose to renew their support contracts, they may renew for shorter contract periods or on other terms that are less beneficial to us. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, so we may not accurately predict future renewal trends.\nWe cannot ensure that our customers will purchase our solution or will renew their support contracts, and their failure to make such purchases or renewals may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition from numerous established companies and new entrants.\nWe face intense competition from numerous established companies that sell competitive enterprise cloud infrastructure systems or storage solutions. These competitors include large system vendors, consisting primarily of Dell EMC and NetApp, and also Hitachi Data Systems, HP Enterprise, IBM and VMware, which each offer a broad range of data center systems targeting various use cases and end markets. We also face competition from other companies, including companies that offer solutions powered entirely or partially by flash memory technology, such as Nimble Storage, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, Nutanix and Pure Storage. These competitors, as well as other potential competitors, when compared to us may have:\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition and longer operating histories;\n\u2022\nlarger sales and marketing and customer support budgets and resources;\n\u2022\nthe ability to bundle enterprise cloud infrastructure systems or storage solutions with other products and services to address customers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nmore comprehensive enterprise cloud infrastructure systems or storage solutions;\n\u2022\ngreater resources to make acquisitions and develop new solutions;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure solutions that are, or that are perceived to be, simpler and faster to deploy, or able to store and process data more effectively;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure solutions that store and process both physical and virtualized workloads;\n\u2022\nlarger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u2022\nsubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources.\nFurthermore, many of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness and long-standing relationships with key decision makers at many of our current and prospective customers. We expect that our competitors will seek to leverage these existing relationships to discourage customers from purchasing our solution. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining relationships with customers, or if customers are reluctant or unwilling to try our solution, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired.\nOur competitors utilize a broad range of competitive strategies. For example, some of our competitors have offered bundled products and services in order to reduce the initial cost of their storage solutions, or seek to exploit concerns of existing and potential customers regarding our financial condition. Our competitors may also compete on purchase price and total cost of ownership, and may choose to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we choose to adopt in the future.\nCertain of our competitors may have developed, claim to have developed or have indicated that they intend to develop enterprise cloud technologies that may compete with our solution. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their solutions, reduce their prices and introduce new services and technologies that may, or that they may claim to, offer greater performance and improved total cost of ownership as compared to our solution. These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors. If we are unable to acquire customers, or if we are forced to reduce prices in order to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf the enterprise cloud market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target customers do not adopt our solution or lose confidence in our company, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenue will suffer.\nWe compete in the new enterprise cloud category with our Tintri VMstore solutions, and the market for enterprise cloud solutions is still in an early stage. Our success depends upon our ability to provide enterprise cloud infrastructure solutions that address the needs of customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies. Many of our target customers have never purchased enterprise cloud infrastructure solutions and may not have the desire or available budget to invest in new technologies such as ours or the confidence in our financial conditions and prospects to make investments in our products, particularly large or\nlong-term investments. Following our initial public offering, or IPO, during fiscal 2018, we observed that some customers reduced or delayed purchases of our systems due to concerns about our financial condition and prospects. Market awareness of our value proposition will be essential to our growth and our success, particularly for the enterprise and CSP markets. It is difficult to predict with any precision customer adoption rates, customer demand for our solution or the future growth rate and size of our market.\nChanges or advances in alternative technologies or adoption of alternative enterprise cloud infrastructure offerings could adversely affect the demand for our solution. If the enterprise cloud infrastructure market does not develop in the way we anticipate, if our solution does not offer benefits compared to competing solutions or if customers do not recognize the benefits that our solution provides, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business and operating results could suffer.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel, especially skilled sales and engineering employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered. We compete with many larger and better funded organizations both inside and outside of the storage industry for skilled personnel, and we may be unable to compete with the compensation and other benefits that these organizations offer to attract candidates and retain existing personnel.\nWe have recently undertaken substantial reductions in our workforce, which may significantly affect our ability to retain our remaining employees or to attract new employees. See \u201cOur recent restructuring actions could adversely affect sales or products and services and other business operations\u201d below.\nVolatility or declines in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. Also, many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards which may, in some cases, equate to a substantial amount of personal wealth. In addition, certain of our employees hold options to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices in excess of recent trading price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, which may lessen the incentive these stock options represent for these employees to remain in our employment. These circumstances may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees. Conversely, recent declines in the trading price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market could reduce, or be perceived by employees to reduce, the value of their outstanding equity awards, which could affect their decision about whether or not they continue to work for us. We have experienced some of these effects since the completion of our IPO, in July 2017, and may continue to see similar recruitment and retention challenges in the future. In the future, we expect to implement employee retention programs from time to time, including through the grant of additional equity awards to existing employees, or the exchange or amendment to the terms of existing employee equity awards. Such programs may not be effective in improving employee retention and may be dilutive to our existing equity holders.\nIn March 2018, we announced that Ken Klein will transition from his role as our Chief Executive Officer and Ian Halifax will transition from his role as our Chief Financial Officer. In March 2018, we also announced that the Board had named Tom Barton as Chief Executive Officer and as a Board member. Mr. Barton subsequently joined the Company, and Mr. Klein and Mr. Halifax left the Company in April 2018. On May 15, 2018, we also appointed Tom Barton as interim Chief Financial Officer. We may experience increased employee turnover as a result of these and other changes in our management team. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel. Any failure to successfully attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs may negatively impact our growth and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur recent restructuring actions could adversely affect sales of products and services and other business operations.\nWe have recently undertaken substantial reductions in our workforce in an effort to drive efficiencies in our sales organization and other business units. In September 2017, we announced a restructuring and reduction in force plan of a little more than 10% of our global workforce. In March 2018, we announced a restructuring and reduction\nin force plan of approximately 20% of our global workforce. These reductions have impacted all of our business units, including our sales and engineering functions. The reduction in the size of our sales team and related support functions may impact our ability to maintain and grow our product sales and to adequately support our post-sales commitments. If we are unable to achieve correspondingly greater efficiency from our sales and related support teams, our bookings may fail to achieve historic growth rates or may decline. In addition, reductions in our engineering and product development teams could negatively impact our ability to generate new products or deliver our current pipeline of products on a timely basis. Furthermore, we believe that further such reductions are likely to be required in the near term dependent on developments in our financial condition. Any of these changes would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur process of considering strategic options could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn December 2017, we announced that we were in the process of considering strategic options to deliver value to our stockholders, and had retained investment bank advisors to assist us in this process. This process could disrupt and create uncertainty concerning our business, regardless of whether the strategic process is completed, and poses other risks to our business, including:\n\u2022\npotential uncertainty in the marketplace concerning our ongoing viability as a business, which could lead current and prospective customers to purchase from other vendors or delay purchasing from us\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility of disruption to our business and operations, including diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the strategic process\u037e\n\u2022\nimpairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel\u037e\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners\u037e\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our business operations and ability to explore strategic alternatives under any definitive agreement we may enter into as a result of this process; and\n\u2022\npotential future stockholder litigation relating to the strategic process that could prevent or delay the strategic process, and the related costs.\nIf any of the foregoing risks were realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe historically experienced rapid growth, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes and controls, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe historically experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our solution, although our growth rate has reduced significantly in recent periods. Our employee headcount and number of customers have increased significantly during certain prior periods, and we intend to continue to grow our customer base in the future.\nFurthermore, we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our products and services with larger customers. The growth of our business and our offerings creates an ongoing strain on our management, operational and financial resources. To manage our growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. The increased operational complexity and higher costs of international product deployments and infrastructure expansion makes managing our growth outside of the United States uniquely challenging. Our failure to scale or manage improvements in these functions, processes and controls could disrupt existing customer relationships, limit the deployments of our solution, reduce the quality of our products and services, increase our technical support costs and impair our ability to operate our business and protect our assets. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our third-party channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our solution will be limited, and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on channel partners and distributors for a substantial majority of our sales. Approximately 89%, 85%, and 90% of our revenue in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, was derived from sales to our channel partners and distributors. We also depend upon our channel partners to manage the customer sales process and to generate sales opportunities. To the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling our sales, managing the sales process or selling our solution, or we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of high-quality, motivated partners in each of our sales regions, our ability to sell our solution will be adversely affected.\nOur contracts with channel partners are typically terminable without cause by either party after an initial term of one year. Our channel partner agreements do not prohibit them from offering competitive products or services and do not contain any purchase commitments. Many of our channel partners also sell our competitors\u2019 solutions. If our channel partners give higher priority to our competitors\u2019 storage solutions, we may be unable to grow our revenue and our net loss could increase. Further, in order to develop and expand our channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel partners, including investments in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage. If we fail to maintain existing channel partners or develop relationships with new channel partners, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nReliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\nAs a result of customer buying patterns and related sales efforts, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including any failure of anticipated sales transactions to materialize, any inability on our part to ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill sales orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter, any failure on our part to manage inventory to meet demand, any inability on our part to release new solutions on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing and other terms that may delay the recognition of revenue or any unexpected sales cancellations, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations and the estimates of analysts, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe markets for enterprise cloud infrastructure systems and storage solutions are rapidly evolving and, if we fail to correctly anticipate and respond to developing industry trends, demand for our solution may decline.\nThe IT infrastructure and storage industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology, customer needs and industry standards. To remain competitive, we must correctly anticipate and invest in the adoption of new and emerging technologies, and continue to innovate our solution to provide superior benefits to our customers. The process of developing or adapting our solution to new technologies is complex and uncertain, and our product development efforts may fail to successfully address our customers\u2019 changing needs. We must commit significant resources to developing new products and product enhancements before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. If we fail to implement or respond to a technology that gains widespread market acceptance, demand for our solution may decline. Conversely, if we adopt a technology for which market demand fails to materialize, then we may incur significant development and marketing expense for which we fail to realize an adequate return. In September 2017, we announced the introduction of a new series of enterprise cloud products, and the extent of market acceptance and demand for these and other new products will affect our future financial results. In addition, one or more new technologies could be introduced that compete favorably with our products or that cause our solution to no longer be able to compete successfully.\nThe success of our products also depends in large part on our ability to successfully adapt our solution to emerging industry standards. The servers, network, software and other components and systems within a datacenter must comply with industry standards in order to interoperate and function efficiently together. If larger companies that are more influential in driving industry standards do not support the same standards we use, market acceptance of our solution could be adversely affected, or we may be required to spend significant time and resources duplicating efforts to adapt to different standards.\nOur failure to successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or respond to changing industry standards would result in a lower revenue growth rate or decreased revenue, either of which would negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to develop or introduce new or enhanced solutions on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. We will need to continue to create valuable software and hardware solutions to be integrated with our enterprise cloud platform. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced solutions that provide increasingly higher levels of performance, capacity, scalability, security and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. In September 2017, we announced the introduction of a new series of enterprise cloud products. The extent of market acceptance and demand for these and other new products are expected to affect our future financial results. Any failure to anticipate or develop new or enhanced solutions or technologies in a timely manner in response to technological shifts could result in decreased revenue and harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. Any new feature or application that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve broad market acceptance. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced solutions that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, we will lose market share and our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur solution must interoperate with third-party hypervisors and operating systems, software applications and hardware, and if we fail to maintain the compatibility of our solution with such software and hardware, we may lose or fail to increase our market share and may experience reduced demand for our solution.\nOur solution must interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, specifically their hypervisors, networks, servers, and other software, which are provided by a wide variety of vendors. For example, our VMstore solutions support hypervisors marketed by Citrix, Microsoft, Open Stack, Red Hat, and VMware. When new or updated versions of these hypervisors or software applications are introduced, we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our solution will interoperate properly. These efforts require capital investment and engineering resources and we may not be able to deliver or maintain interoperability quickly, cost-effectively or at all. If we fail to maintain compatibility of our solution with these infrastructure components, our customers may not be able to fully utilize our solution, and we may, among other consequences, lose or fail to increase our market share and experience reduced demand for our solution, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to successfully increase sales of our solution to large organizations and CSPs, our operating results may suffer.\nOur growth strategy is dependent in large part upon increasing sales of our solution to large organizations and CSPs. Sales to these customers involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to smaller customers. These risks include:\n\u2022\ncompetition from companies that traditionally target larger organizations and CSPs and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from such customers;\n\u2022\nincreased purchasing power and leverage held by large customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nmore stringent requirements in our support and maintenance contracts, including demand for faster support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements; and\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential customer that elects not to purchase our solution.\nIn addition, large organizations, including government entities, typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater solutions functionality and scalability, require a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect\ngreater payment flexibility. If we fail to realize an expected sale from a large customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Following our IPO during fiscal 2018, we observed that some customers reduced or delayed purchases of our systems due to concerns about our financial condition and prospects.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and may require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nThe timing of customer sales commitments and our recognition of revenue is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our solutions\u2019 sales cycles. A sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and any sale of our solution. Our sales cycles typically range from three to six months. Customers, especially large enterprises, CSPs and government entities, often view the purchase of our solution as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our solution prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order. During our sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, and sometimes make investments in evaluation equipment, all of which lower our operating margins, particularly if no sale occurs.\nEven if a customer decides to purchase our solution, there are many factors that affect the timing of the customer\u2019s purchase and our recognition of revenue, including the strategic importance of a particular project to a customer, budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel. Even after a customer makes a purchase, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase. For all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. If our sales cycles lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single family of products, and a decline in demand for our solution would cause our revenue to grow more slowly or to decline.\nOur enterprise cloud platform, which includes our proprietary Tintri OS and our stand-alone software products, accounts for all of our product revenue and will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, any of the following events or developments could have a comparatively greater impact on our business than they would if we offered a broader range of solutions:\n\u2022\nthe failure of our current solutions to achieve broad market acceptance;\n\u2022\nany decline or fluctuation in demand for our current solutions, whether as a result of customer budgetary constraints, introduction of competing products or technologies or other factors; and\n\u2022\nour inability to release enhanced versions of our current solutions, including any related software, on a timely basis.\nIf the market for enterprise cloud infrastructure solutions grows more slowly than anticipated, if demand for our solution declines, or if we fail to deliver new solutions, new features, or new releases that meet customer demand, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe recognize revenue from support agreements over the term of the relevant support period, and as a result downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nSupport and maintenance revenue was 20%, 22%, and 28% of our revenue in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We recognize support and maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the relevant support period, which ranges from one to five years. As a result, much of the support and maintenance revenue we report each quarter is derived from support agreements that we sold in prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed support agreements, or decreases in the relative pricing of new support agreements, in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of support and maintenance is not reflected in full in our operating results until future periods. In addition, because revenue from renewals must be recognized ratably over the applicable\nservice period, it may be difficult for us to rapidly increase our support and maintenance revenue through additional sales in any period. The percentage of our total revenue that we derive from support and maintenance agreements may vary over time if we change the relative pricing of our products or support agreements. Our revenue from support agreements as a percentage of total revenue may decline as a result of changes in the relative pricing of our products and support. Changes in the mix of our product revenue and support and maintenance revenue may adversely affect our business, operating results and the trading price of our common stock.\nThe sales prices of our products and services may decrease, which would reduce our gross profit and adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe sales prices for our products or support and maintenance services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, a change in our mix of products and services and the introduction of competing products or services or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the markets in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, which may lead to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services. Our sales prices could also decline due to pricing pressure caused by several factors, including overcapacity in the worldwide supply of competitive storage solutions, increased manufacturing efficiencies and implementation of new manufacturing processes. In addition, although we price our products and services predominantly in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. To the extent we introduce new solutions, we anticipate that the sales prices for our existing solutions will decrease. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our new product and services offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain or improve our gross margins and achieve profitability. Furthermore, future cash requirements could require us to introduce additional discounting in order to generate increased sales. Any such decline in our sales prices could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to successfully market and sell our solution is dependent in part on the quality of our customer support, and any failure to offer high-quality technical support could harm our business.\nOnce our solution is deployed within our customers\u2019 datacenters, customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our solution. Our ability to provide effective support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, as well as to engage with qualified support partners that provide a similar level of customer support. Furthermore, as we continue to expand our international operations, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English and provisioning and staffing our international customer support field offices. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our solution and business reputation and on recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain, or a market perception that we do not maintain, high-quality technical support, including installation, could harm our reputation and our ability to sell our solution to existing and prospective customers.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our channel partners, distributors and direct customers, which could result in losses and negatively impact our operating results.\nSome of our channel partners, distributors and direct customers have experienced financial difficulties in the past. A channel partner, distributor or direct customer experiencing such difficulties will generally not purchase or sell as many of our systems as it may have done under normal circumstances and may cancel orders. Our typical payment terms are 30 days from invoice but payment terms may be longer in particular circumstances and markets. In addition, a channel partner, distributor or direct customer experiencing financial difficulties generally increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. Any concentration of our accounts receivable in one or a limited number of our channel partners, distributors and direct customers may increase our credit risk with respect to those channel partners, distributors and direct customers. If any of our channel partners, distributors or direct customers that represent a significant portion of our revenue becomes insolvent or suffers deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our solution, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to increase our revenue and our business will be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have a channel sales model, our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our prospective customers. Therefore, we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and sell additional solutions to our existing customers. As such, we have invested and expect to continue to invest substantially in our sales organization. Competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require is intense and our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth.\nIn August 2017, we announced changes to the structure of our sales organization, including the departure of our former Chief Sales Officer, and Ken Klein, our former Chief Executive Officer, assuming more direct involvement with our sales organization. In March 2018, we announced the promotion of Tom Cashman to Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Alliances. In March 2018, we also announced that the Board had named Tom Barton as our new Chief Executive Officer, who began his employment in April 2018. On May 15, 2018, we also appointed Tom Barton as interim Chief Financial Officer. These changes and other changes may impact our ability to attract and retain sales personnel.\nA significant percentage of our sales force is new to our company and therefore less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity; we estimate based on past experience that sales team members typically do not fully ramp and are not fully productive during the first several quarters of employment with us. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional set up and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and operating results.\nIn general, our sales are subject to seasonal trends. Our fourth fiscal quarter, ending January 31, typically has the highest revenue of any of our fiscal quarters, and our first fiscal quarter, ending April 30, typically has the lowest revenue of any of our fiscal quarters. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including the budgeting, procurement and deployment cycles of many of our customers. Our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date. To the extent our revenue growth slows, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales to U.S. federal, state and local governments are subject to numerous challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business.\nAlthough sales to U.S. federal, state and local government agencies accounted for less than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, our sales to government agencies may increase in the future. Sales to such government entities are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nselling to government agencies can be extensively regulated, highly competitive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale;\n\u2022\ngovernment certification requirements applicable to our solution may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the U.S. federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification;\n\u2022\ngovernment demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, changes in administration and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\ngovernment agencies may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate our sales contracts for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results;\n\u2022\ngovernments routinely investigate and audit government contractors\u2019 administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our solution, which would adversely impact our revenue and operating results, or result in fines, civil or criminal liability or repayment of any overcharges, if any such audit uncovers improper or illegal activities; and\n\u2022\ngovernment agencies may require certain products to be manufactured in the United States and other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, which may require costly changes to our manufacturing practices or otherwise adversely affect our ability to sell these products to such agencies.\nIf any of the above risks are realized, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur solution is highly technical and may contain undetected defects, which could cause data unavailability, loss or corruption that might, in turn, result in liability to our customers and harm to our reputation and business.\nOur solution is highly technical and complex and is often used to store information critical to our customers\u2019 business operations. Our solution, particularly with respect to newly introduced or redesigned products, may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities that could result in data unavailability, loss, corruption or other harm to our customers. Some errors in our solution may only be discovered after they have been installed and used by customers. Our solution has experienced temporary outages after they have been deployed. Any outages, errors, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solution after commercial release could result in a loss of revenue, injury to our reputation, a loss of customers or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, errors or failures in the solutions of third-party technology vendors may be attributed to us and may harm our reputation.\nIf our solution fails, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Although our customers are generally required to enter into our standard \u201cclick wrap\u201d terms of service, which includes provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, these terms may be difficult to enforce. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, would be costly and might divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our solution. Our business liability insurance coverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all. These product-related issues could result in claims against us, and negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks, and failure to manage those risks could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from channel partners outside the United States. Revenue generated from customers outside of the United States was 30%, 30%, and 27% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. We are continuing to adapt to and develop strategies to address international markets but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. As of January 31, 2018, 14% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States. We expect that our international activities will continue to grow over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets, which will require significant management attention and financial resources. We are subject to risks associated with having significant worldwide operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreased complexity and costs of managing international operations;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical and economic instability and military conflicts;\n\u2022\nlimited protection of our intellectual property and other assets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with local laws and regulations and unanticipated changes in local laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ntrade and foreign exchange restrictions and higher tariffs;\n\u2022\ntravel restrictions;\n\u2022\ntiming and availability of import and export licenses and other government approvals, permits and licenses, including export classification requirements;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations relating to our international operating activities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by the U.S. government on our ability to do business with certain companies or in certain countries as a result of international political conflicts;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and other consequences of limited local infrastructure and disruptions, such as large scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers;\n\u2022\nreliance upon third parties to provide solution support services outside of the Unites States;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing international operations and increased compliance costs and potential liabilities associated with employment laws and practices outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nincreased costs and risk of loss associated with provisioning local field offices to provide solution support services;\n\u2022\nheightened risk of terrorist acts;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor relations;\n\u2022\nregional health issues and natural disasters that are endemic to regions which we operate and sell or manufacture our solution;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts generally; and\n\u2022\nwork stoppages.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. These factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and, consequently, impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, and any failure to forecast demand for our products or manage our relationship with our contract manufacturer, or if that manufacturer\u2019s business were to become impaired in the future, our ability to sell our products could be impacted.\nWe contract with an offshore subsidiary of Flex to manufacture all of our products. Our reliance on Flex reduces our control over the assembly process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, production costs and product supply. If we fail to manage our relationship with Flex effectively, or if Flex experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be adversely affected. In addition, any adverse change in Flex\u2019s financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers. If we are required to change our contract manufacturer or assume internal manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs and damage our customer relationships. In addition, qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing production can be an expensive and lengthy process. If we experience increased demand that Flex is unable to fulfill, or if Flex is unable or unwilling to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products for any other reason, we could experience a delay in our order fulfillment, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur agreement with Flex is terminable at any time by us with 90 days\u2019 notice or by Flex with 120 days\u2019 notice and Flex has no obligation to provide services transitioning our manufacturing processes to another manufacturer. Our agreement with Flex does not provide for any specific volume purchase commitments, though we are required to submit a nine month forecast for orders (the first three months of which are binding) and orders are placed on a purchase order basis. Furthermore, because we contract with a subsidiary of Flex, we have limited recourse to assets held by other members of the Flex group of companies in the event of manufacturing problems or other claims. If we are required to change to a new contract manufacturer, qualify an additional contract manufacturer or assume\ninternal manufacturing operations for any reason, including financial problems of our contract manufacturer, reduction of manufacturing output made available to us, or the termination of our contract, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs and damage our customer relationships.\nWe intend to introduce new products and product enhancements, which could require us to coordinate with Flex and component suppliers in order to achieve volume production rapidly. We may need to increase our component purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions if we experience increased demand for our products. Our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by Flex from its customers. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority in the event Flex is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations in a timely manner. If Flex is unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products, or if we are, or Flex is unable to obtain adequate quantities of components, it could cause a delay in our order fulfillment, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipments of our products and could harm our relationships with current and prospective customers.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, and in some cases single-source suppliers, for several key hardware components of our solution. These components are generally purchased on a purchase order basis through Flex, and we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. For example, the chassis used in our hybrid-flash systems and our new all-flash systems are obtained on a purchase order-basis under an agreement with a single-source component supplier that has no fixed term.\nOur current purchase volumes may be too low for us to be considered a priority customer by certain of our suppliers. Any of the sole-source and limited source suppliers we rely on could stop producing our components, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, our competitors. Our reliance on key suppliers exposes us to risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain an adequate supply of key components;\n\u2022\ndelays or disruptions of shipments of our products or their components;\n\u2022\nprice volatility for the components of our products;\n\u2022\nfailure of a supplier to meet our quality or production requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of a supplier of key components to remain in business or adjust to market conditions; and\n\u2022\nconsolidation among suppliers, resulting in some suppliers exiting the industry or discontinuing the manufacture of components.\nIn addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increases product and product-related costs.\nAs a result of these risks, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain enough key components in the future or that the cost of these components will not increase. We generally order our components on a \u201cbuild to order\u201d basis, and do not maintain any significant inventory of the components used in our products. The technology industry has experienced component shortages and delivery delays in the past, and we may experience shortages or delays of critical components in the future as a result of strong demand in the industry or other factors. If our supply of components is disrupted or delayed, or if we need to replace our existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional components will be available when required or on terms that are favorable to us, which could extend our lead times and increase the costs of our components. Switching suppliers may require that we redesign our products to accommodate new components and to re-qualify our solution, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nAny interruption in the supply of our components may adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses, any of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nInsufficient supply and inventory of our products and their components may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory will harm our gross margins.\nOur third-party manufacturer procures components and builds our products based on our forecasts, and we generally do not hold inventory for a prolonged period of time. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue forecasts for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable. Our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to make accurate forecasts and effectively manage the supply of our products and components. We have, in the past, had to write off inventory in connection with transitions to new product models. If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write down or write off excess or obsolete inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. Alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential customers turn to competitors\u2019 products that may be more readily available. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition, which could harm our business.\nConsolidation among IT infrastructure providers has been common. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had offered individually. For example, in February 2016, NetApp acquired SolidFire, a developer of all-flash storage systems, in September 2016, Dell acquired EMC, in February 2017, HP Enterprise acquired SimpliVity, a developer of hyperconverged systems, in April 2017, HP Enterprise acquired Nimble Storage, a storage solutions provider, and in September 2017, Cisco acquired Springpath, a developer of hyperconverged systems. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions through strategic acquisitions.\nConsolidation in our industry may result in stronger competitors that may create more compelling offerings, offer greater pricing flexibility and be better able to compete as their customers\u2019 sole-source vendors. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs and breadth of technology offerings. In addition, companies with which we have strategic partnerships may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, causing them to reduce their business with us. Continued industry consolidation may adversely affect customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 perceptions of the viability of less mature technology companies such as us and, consequently, their willingness to purchase from us. Any such competitive forces resulting from consolidation in our industry could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur research and development efforts may not produce successful solutions that result in significant revenue in the near future, if at all.\nDeveloping new solutions and related enhancements is expensive and time consuming. Our investments in research and development may result in solutions that do not achieve market adoption, are more expensive to develop than anticipated, take longer to generate revenue or generate less revenue than we anticipate. Our future plans include significant investments in research and development for new solutions and related opportunities. We believe that we must continue to dedicate significant resources to our research and development efforts to maintain or expand our competitive position. However, these efforts may not result in significant revenue in the near future, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our technology, intellectual property and proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that any patents or trademarks will be issued with respect to any pending patent or trademark applications in a manner that gives us adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, or that any patents or trademarks issued to us or our other intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have filed for patents and trademarks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, or may be difficult to enforce in practice. Our currently issued patents and trademarks and any patents or trademarks that may be issued in the future with respect to pending or future applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property rights.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and technology, and infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult, particularly internationally. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar solutions, potentially harming our business. Further, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defending intellectual property rights infringement claims and to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property rights or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our intellectual property rights, in whole or in part. If we are unable to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property, technology and our intellectual property rights, the value of our intellectual property, technology and intellectual property rights, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThird-party claims that we are infringing intellectual property rights, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business could be adversely affected.\nA number of companies, both within and outside of the IT infrastructure industry, hold a large number of patents covering aspects of storage, servers and virtualization solutions. In addition to these patents, participants in this industry typically also protect their technology through copyrights and trade secrets. As a result, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past, and may in the future, receive inquiries from other intellectual property rights holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses and may in the future become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights, particularly as we expand our presence in the market and face increasing competition. We have in the past and may in the future be required to enter into agreements with such intellectual property rights holders involving the payment of royalties or other fees, or granting a limited license of our intellectual property rights, in order to resolve such inquiries and settle such claims. We cannot assure you that our business or products or services do not violate such rights of such third-party claimants. Regardless of the merit of any such claim, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. In addition, parties may claim that the names and branding of our solution infringe their trademark rights in certain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail we may have to change the names and branding of our solution in the affected territories and incur other costs.\nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers, suppliers and channel and other partners from damages and costs which may arise from the infringement by our solution of third-party intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. The scope of these indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees. Our insurance may not cover all\nintellectual property rights infringement claims. A claim that our solution infringes a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from purchasing our solution and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party relating to infringement by our solution, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our solution against intellectual property rights infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\nOur defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against us or our customers, suppliers and channel partners, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention and force us to acquire or license intellectual property rights, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in defending against any such claims. Further, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. In addition, patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published, so we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive the inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and prevent us from offering our solution to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute solutions that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. We may be unable to replace those technologies with technologies that have the same features or functionality and that are of equal quality and performance standards on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and as a result may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks on our systems or solutions could compromise our proprietary information (or information of our customers), disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our solution, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer, create additional liabilities and adversely affect our financial conditions and stock price.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data on our internal systems, networks and servers, which may include intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and sales data, which may include personally identifiable information. In addition, we design and sell solutions that our customers use to store their data. The security of our own networks and the intrusion protection features of our solution are both critical to our operations and business strategy.\nWe devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities and cannot provide absolute security. Any destructive or intrusive breach of our internal systems could result in the information stored on our networks being accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, an effective attack on our solution could disrupt the proper functioning of our solution, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers, disrupt or temporarily interrupt customers\u2019 operations or cause other destructive outcomes, including the theft of information sufficient to engage in fraudulent transactions. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand our network of channel partners, resellers and authorized service providers and as we operate in more countries. The economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, viruses, worms, malicious software systems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which is often difficult to identify. If any of these types of security breaches, actual or perceived, were to occur and we were to be unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners and customers could be damaged, our reputation and brand could be harmed, use of our solution could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our use of \u201copen source\u201d software, our ability to sell our products and services could be harmed, which could result in competitive disadvantages, and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe incorporate open source software in our products and services. Use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of proprietary or third-party commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin, functionality or other features of the software. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their solutions to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source software generally available in source code form for limited fees or at no cost. Although we monitor our use of open source software, open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software in our solution, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our software, discontinue the sale of certain solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with applicable open source licenses, we may be subject to costly claims of intellectual property rights infringement or demands for the public release of proprietary source code. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may become subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully disclosed or that we have wrongfully used proprietary information of their former employers, which could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at current or potential competitors. Although we require our employees to not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us and we are not currently subject to any claims that they have done so, we have in the past received inquiries from former employers of our employees and we may in the future become subject to claims that these employees have divulged, or we have used, proprietary information of these employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we are unable to successfully defend any such claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages and to discontinue our commercialization of certain solutions. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper our ability to develop new solutions and features for our existing solutions, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation efforts are costly, time-consuming and a significant distraction to management.\nWe may face risks related to shareholder litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nWe are currently and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of securities laws or other related claims, including shareholder derivative litigation, which could harm our business, divert management attention and require us to incur significant costs. For example, following our initial public offering in July 2017, four class action lawsuits were filed against us, as described in Item 1, Legal Proceedings. Each lawsuit is purportedly brought on behalf of a putative class of all persons who purchased shares of common stock pursuant or traceable to our initial public offering, and seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees and costs on behalf of the putative class.\nWe are generally required, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits. We also have certain contractual obligations to the underwriters regarding such lawsuits. While a certain amount of insurance coverage may be available for expenses or losses associated with these lawsuits, this coverage may not be sufficient. Based on information currently available, we are unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss, if any, with regards to these lawsuits; therefore, no litigation reserve has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. Although we plan to defend against these lawsuits vigorously, there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained. These lawsuits or future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our solution to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our international sales. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States, denominated in foreign currencies and subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. If we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our key technical, sales and management personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Tom Barton, our incoming Chief Executive Officer, and Kieran Harty, our co-founder and Chief Technical Officer, who are each critical to the development of our technology, future vision and strategic direction. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team, and changes to our senior managerial or other key employee could have a negative impact on our business. For example, in August 2017, we announced the departure of our former Chief Sales Officer and changes to the structure of our sales organization. In March 2018, we announced the departure of Ken Klein, our then-Chief Executive Officer, and Ian Halifax, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Klein\u2019s and Mr. Halifax\u2019s departures became effective in April 2018. All of our employees are employed by us on an at-will basis, and we could experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team or other key personnel, including as a result of layoffs, concerns by employees regarding our financial condition and the future of our business, and the loss of retention value of employee equity awards due to declines in the trading price of our common stock. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies that cover any of our officers or other key employees. The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our solution and negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our company culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity, teamwork, passion for customers and focus on execution, as well as facilitating critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our company culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nOur ability to hire and retain employees may be negatively impacted by changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures.\nForeign nationals who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents constitute an important part of our U.S. workforce, particularly in the areas of engineering and product development. Our ability to hire and retain these workers and their ability to remain and work in the United States are impacted by laws and regulations, as well as by procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies. Changes in immigration laws, regulations or procedures, including those that may be enacted by the current U.S. presidential administration, may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain such workers, increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our ability to deliver our products and services.\nWe may further expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management\u2019s attention, resulting in additional dilution to our stockholders and consumption of resources that are necessary to sustain and grow our business.\nWhile we have not consummated any acquisitions to date, we may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses in order to expand our solution, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as government regulatory approvals, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\nThese kinds of acquisitions or investments may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us. We may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. In connection with these types of transactions, we may issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, encounter difficulties integrating diverse business cultures and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign government agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any government sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state and local government organizations, which affect how we and our channel partners do business with government agencies. Selling our solution to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines and other penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. As an example, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the General Services Administration, or GSA, have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with IT vendors under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of GSA contracts for sales to the federal government. The DOJ and GSA continue to actively pursue such claims. Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThese laws and regulations impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property, and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with certain customers could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC may limit our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, and could have negative consequences related to our financing agreements.\nWe did not file this Annual Report on Form 10-K within the timeframe required by the SEC. As a result of this late filing, we may be limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business. We are ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S-3, to register our securities for sale for a period of 12 months following the month in which we regain compliance with our SEC reporting obligations. While we may be able to use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital or complete acquisitions, doing so would likely increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to government export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nOur solution is subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and we incorporate encryption technology into our solution. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption registration.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to the U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the export, re-export and transfer of certain products and services without the required export authorizations, including to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. embargoes or sanctions. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities even if the export license ultimately may be granted. While we take precautions to prevent our solution from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our encryption products and screening exports against U.S. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in significant fines or penalties, denial of export privileges, and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers could be imposed for criminal violations of these laws.\nWe also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. No assurance can be given that our channel partners will comply with export requirements.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including through import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solution or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our solution in those countries. Changes in our solution or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solution in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solution globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various government agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could\nresult in decreased use of our solution by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solution to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solution or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in tariffs, sanctions, international treaties, and export/import laws may delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, persons or entities altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased demand for our products, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decrease in demand for our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to government regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base and thereby decrease our revenue.\nThe United States and other jurisdictions where we offer our solution have laws, regulations and standards governing the protection of information privacy, data protection and information security. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies. In addition, agreements with our customers and business partners may contain contractual provisions related to the protection of information privacy, data protection and information security.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use and dissemination of data. In addition, many foreign countries and government bodies, including in Australia, the European Union, Japan and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit customers to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use personally identifiable information for certain purposes. In addition, a foreign government could require that any personally identifiable information collected in a country not be disseminated outside of that country, and we are not currently equipped to comply with such a requirement. We also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other information security- or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to information security and data protection. We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. In addition, we expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted in new manners in the future. For example, an October 2015 decision by the Court of Justice for the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which facilitated personal data transfers to the U.S. in compliance with applicable EU data protection laws. While we did not rely upon the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework for our transfer of EU personal data to the United States, and do not rely upon its replacement framework, the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield, there remains some regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of data transfers from the European Union to the United States. In addition, European legislators have adopted a general data protection regulation that will, when effective in May 2018, supersede current EU data protection legislation, impose more stringent EU data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could\nimpair our or our customers\u2019 ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our solution, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our solution. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected cybersecurity breach, ransomware attack or other security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or use or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data, may result in government enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges to laws or regulations affecting privacy could impose additional costs and liabilities on us and could limit our use of such information to add value for customers. If we were required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement burdensome compliance measures, our business and operating results could be harmed. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties, and potential litigation if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and/or data security laws, regulations, standards and other requirements. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy-related laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our product solutions and reduce overall demand.\nFurthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers\u2019 customers to resist providing the data and information necessary to allow our customers to use our product solutions effectively. Even the perception that the privacy and/or security of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet applicable legal, regulatory and other requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our solution.\nFailure to comply with anticorruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. We face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person or securing any advantage. In addition, we use various third parties to sell our solution and conduct our business abroad. We, our channel partners, and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We continue to implement our FCPA/anti-corruption compliance program and cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anticorruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and changes in our effective tax rate or changes in tax laws or their application to the operation of our business could adversely impact our operating results and our business.\nWe conduct operations in multiple jurisdictions, and we are subject to certain taxes, including income, sales and use, value added and other taxes, in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. A change in the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, possibly with retroactive effect, could result in a material increase in the amount of taxes we incur. Recent changes to U.S. tax laws that limit the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and require the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the United States. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has initiated a base erosion and profit shifting project which seeks to establish certain international standards for taxing the worldwide income of multinational companies. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase our liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties, and therefore could harm our cash flows, operating results and financial position. Finally, the amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and transfer pricing arrangements, as well as any future intercompany transactions we may undertake.\nIn the United States, a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies. It is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate or balance sheet at this time. Proposed changes in corporate tax rates, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the period in which tax reform is enacted, or could result in increases to our future United States tax expense. Furthermore, proposed changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings.\nWe are subject to periodic audits or other reviews by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business, and these tax authorities may disagree with our interpretations of applicable tax law or our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions or may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions. In addition, authorities in jurisdictions in which we do not file tax returns could assert that we are subject to tax in such jurisdiction. In either case, such authorities could impose additional taxes, interest and penalties, claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries. Any such audit, examination or review requires management\u2019s time, diverts internal resources and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, may result in additional tax liabilities or other adjustments to our historical results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales. We have previously filed voluntary disclosure agreements with several U.S. states related to past due sales and use taxes. While we believe that we have properly accrued for sales and use taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, taxing authorities may assert that we owe additional taxes, interest or penalties, which may impact our historical and future results.\nBecause we conduct operations in multiple jurisdictions, our effective tax rate is influenced by the amounts of income and expense attributed to each jurisdiction. If such amounts were to change so as to increase the amounts of our net income subject to taxation in higher-tax jurisdictions, or if we were to commence operations in jurisdictions assessing relatively higher tax rates, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected. In addition, we may determine that it is advisable from time to time to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries under circumstances that could give rise to imposition of potentially significant tax liabilities, including withholding taxes by the jurisdictions\nin which such amounts were earned, without our receiving the benefit of any offsetting tax credits, which could also adversely impact our effective tax rate and operating results.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2018, we had $348.2 million of federal and $153.8 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. U.S. federal and state income tax laws limit the amount of these carryforwards we can utilize in any given year to offset our taxable income following an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% cumulative shift of the stock ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), including ownership changes due to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock. Some of our existing carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and we may experience subsequent ownership changes. Accordingly, there is a risk that our ability to use our existing carryforwards in the future could be limited and that existing carryforwards would be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Furthermore, our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause some of our net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire and our existing net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by legislative or regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of net operating carryforwards. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our net operating loss carryforwards, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nLegislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted in December 2017, and contains many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, the consequences of which have not yet been determined. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realizability of the net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses contained in the Act or other tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, a company generally has up to one year from the Tax Act enactment date to complete the accounting under ASC 740 to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax, or the Transition Tax, is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries at reduced tax rates. We have made a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and expect to utilize U.S. net operating losses to reduce the tax. However, we have not collected all of the necessary data to complete our analysis of the effect of the Tax Act on our underlying deferred taxes and as such, the amounts recorded in our financial statements as of January 31, 2018, are provisional.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our platforms.\nWe are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, that will require us to investigate, disclose and report whether the hardware components that house our solution contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our solution. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used in or necessary to the production of our hardware components and, if applicable, potential changes to components, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our hardware components contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to alter our solution, processes or sources of supply to avoid use of such materials.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. Examples of these laws and regulations include the EU Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE, as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nThe EU RoHS and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. Currently, the manufacturer of the hardware components that house our solution and our major component part suppliers comply with the EU RoHS requirements. However, if there are changes to this or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions may cause us to incur additional costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply.\nOur failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and operating results. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our operating results or cash flows, and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or significant power outage, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Our corporate headquarters and the location where our products are manufactured are located in a region known for seismic activity. In addition, natural disasters could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers\u2019 ability to provide materials and perform services such as manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis. In the event we or our service providers are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism and\nother geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our supply chain, manufacturer, logistics providers, partners or customers, or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturer, logistics providers, partners or customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our suppliers\u2019 disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, and may decline and could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including enterprise cloud companies, have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public or any decision to cease providing financial projections to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology or comparable companies, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in our executive management team or departures of key employees;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the financial covenants and other terms contained in our credit agreements;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses, or the competitive landscape generally; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nStock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility and class action lawsuits have been filed against us. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d below. Such litigation could subject us to substantial costs and divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nThe market price for our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. As of January 31, 2018, we had approximately 31.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nIn addition, we have granted stock option, RSU and other equity-based awards to our service providers from time to time, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be required to increase the aggregate size of these grants, or modify the standard vesting conditions we have utilized in the past with these grants, as compared with our historical equity award practices. Any of these practices may have the effect of increasing the number of shares of our common stock that are available for sale and negatively impact the market price for our common stock.\nHolders of an aggregate of 19,790,378 shares of our common stock as of January 31, 2018, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our other stockholders.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and RSUs under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nIf a substantial number of shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of ownership among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders provides them, collectively, with substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies might make our common stock less attractive to investors, which would in turn decrease the value of our stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial disclosure obligations, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. If we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than the information you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nThe requirements of being a public company subject us to increased costs as compared to prior periods and may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The requirements of these rules and regulations have resulted in an increase in our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs as compared to prior periods, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We have been and will be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we rely on third-party software and system providers for ensuring our reporting obligations and effective internal controls, and to the extent these third parties fail to provide adequate service including as a result of any inability to scale to handle our growth and the imposition of these increased reporting and internal controls and procedures, we could incur material costs for upgrading or switching systems and our business could be affected.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain appropriate levels of coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of the Board, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are obligated to further develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our annual report covering the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Prior to our initial public offering, we had never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. In addition, as a result of our testing of internal controls, we may identify control deficiencies which could result in a material weakness or significant deficiency. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and\ntake a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, our loan and security agreements with SVB and TriplePoint prohibit us from paying dividends, and future financing or credit agreements that we enter into may contain similar restrictions. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the Board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the Board, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president and that limit the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the Board;\n\u2022\nlimit the liability of, and provide indemnification to, our directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the Board may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting for members of the Board;\n\u2022\nauthorize the Board to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nany action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 16806, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TNTRQ"}
