RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as the discussion in the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained herein, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nUncertain global economic conditions may continue to adversely affect demand for our services.\nOur revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for IT services in the markets in which we operate. Economic weakness and constrained IT spending has resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings and growth rates. A material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in North America, Canada and Europe. Weakening in these markets as a result of high government deficits, credit downgrades or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and effectively build our revenue and resource plans. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Delays or reductions in IT spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, and consequently the results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.\nOur operations and assets in India expose us to regulatory, economic, political and other uncertainties in India which could harm our business.\nWe have a significant offshore presence in India where a majority of our technical professionals are located. In the past, the Indian economy has experienced many of the problems confronting the economies of developing countries, including high inflation and varying gross domestic product growth. Salaries and other related benefits constitute a major portion of our total operating costs. Most of our employees are based in India where our wage costs have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the United States and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages. However, wage increases in India or other countries where we have our operations may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Unless we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees, wage increases in the long term may reduce our profit margins.\nRecently, India had a change in the government. The change in government leads to a degree of uncertainty and anticipation regarding new economic initiatives and reforms. This may have an impact on investment decisions and operations. Further, India has experienced natural disasters and incidents of terrorism which have\nemerged as the biggest risk. In the event that any of our business centers are affected by any such disasters, we may sustain damage to our operations and properties, suffer significant losses and be unable to complete our client engagements in a timely manner. In addition, companies may decline to contract with us for services in the light of these risks, because of more generalized concerns about relying on a service provider utilizing international resources that may be viewed as less stable than those provided domestically.\nWe are subject to significant influence over actions exercised by the Indian government which could have an adverse effect on our business sector. Such actions by the government could influence the functioning of our business both in long and short term. We have been provided significant tax incentives in the past, which includes among other things, tax holidays and favorable rules on foreign investment and repatriation. In addition, a change in laws, policies and regulations by the regulators including changes in industry or trade policies, budget amendments or a change in the government could require costly changes to the way we operate and remove any of the benefits realized by us which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a limited number of clients in a limited number of industries which are primarily located in the United States and Europe and our revenues may be reduced if these clients significantly decrease their IT spending.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in North America, as well as clients concentrated in certain industries. Economic slowdowns, changes in U.S. law and other restrictions or factors that affect the economic health of these industries may affect our business. In the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 69% of our revenue was derived from customers located in the United States. We have in the past derived, and may in the future derive, a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively limited number of clients. Our five largest clients represented approximately 39%, 40% and 37% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Consequently, if our top clients reduce or postpone their IT spending significantly, this may lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Further, any significant decrease in the growth of the financial services or other industry segments on which we focus may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows.\nOur client contracts, including those with our two largest customers, typically can be terminated without cause and with little or no notice or penalty, and contain other provisions which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur clients typically retain us through non-exclusive master service agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d). Most of our client project contracts, including those that are on a fixed-price and fixed-price service level agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d) basis can be terminated for cause, with zero to ninety days notice and without termination-related penalties and without cause with zero to one hundred and eighty days notice with or without termination fee. As a result, the termination of project contracts results in the loss of anticipated revenues and potential reduction in profit margins in subsequent periods.\nOur MSAs typically do not include any commitment by our clients to give us a specific volume of business or future work and certain of our MSAs do not require the client to make payments for any services or work reasonably deemed unacceptable to the client. Our business is dependent on the decisions and actions of our clients, many of which are outside our control, which might result in the termination of a project or the loss of a client and the incurrence of penalties and liabilities as a result of such termination. Our clients may demand price reductions, change their outsourcing strategy by limiting the number of suppliers they use, moving more work in-house or to our competitors or replacing their existing software with packaged software supported by licensors. Any of these decisions or actions could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur clients may seek to reduce their dependence on India for outsourced IT services or take advantage of the services provided in countries with labor costs similar to or lower than India.\nClients which presently outsource a significant proportion of their IT services requirements to vendors in India may, for various reasons, including in response to rising labor costs in India and to diversify geographic risk, seek to reduce their dependence on one country. We expect that future competition will increasingly include firms with operations in other countries, especially those countries with labor costs similar to or lower than India, such as China, the Philippines and countries in Eastern Europe. Since wage costs in our industry in India are increasing, our ability to compete effectively will become increasingly dependent on our reputation, the quality of our services and our expertise in specific industries. If labor costs in India rise at a rate which is significantly greater than labor costs in other countries, our reliance on the labor in India may reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our ability to compete, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have operations in twenty seven countries and as we expand our international operations, more of our customers pay us in foreign currencies. Transactions in currencies other than U.S. Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) subject us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the USD and other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income, which may in turn have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The exchange rate between the USD and other currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate in the future. We expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in USD for the foreseeable future and that a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, as well as capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in other currencies such as Indian Rupee (\u201cINR\u201d), Canadian Dollars (\u201cCAD\u201d), Mexican Pesos, Australian Dollars, British Pounds (\u201cGBP\u201d), Euro, and Japanese Yen (\u201cJPY\u201d). The hedging strategies that we have implemented, or may in the future implement, to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market, operational and counterparty credit risks. Accordingly, we may incur losses from our use of foreign exchange derivate contracts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of loss and counterparty default risks relating to the cash and investment deposits and the hedges it enters into which could result in significant losses and harm to our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe have entered into arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk on INR denominated payments and monetary assets. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. In times of market distress, we are subject to the risk that our counterparties could not make good on a transaction, but also to the risk that our counterparties\u2019 counterparties might fail to live up to the terms of a transaction, increasing risk to our counterparties and thereby transmitting it back to us. This type of cross-firm connectivity has the ability to greatly magnify the systemic shocks of a significant default by any single firm. In such circumstances, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack the contractual ability or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate the cash required to service our debt.\nAlthough, we extinguished in mid 2014, our 9% Senior Notes by refinancing them at lower rate of interest, we cannot assure you that in future we will be able to raise funds at favourable terms. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are expected to be, subject to substantial fluctuations, and will depend upon general economic conditions and financial, competitive,\nlegislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, before maturity, seek additional equity capital, reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures or sell material assets or operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to pay our debt or refinance it on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding debt. If such a default were to occur, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loans and the Packing Credit Facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loans and the Packing Credit Facility, as applicable, immediately due and payable, and such lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds under the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loans and the Packing Credit Facility, as applicable. If the amounts outstanding are accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets will be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the banks or to our debt holders.\nThe Indenture, the Term Loans, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Packing Credit Facility contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business and could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.\nThe Indenture, the Term Loans, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Packing Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments (including paying dividends on, redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock);\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer assets to us;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ndo acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nenter into joint ventures.\nA breach of any of the covenants contained in our Term Loans, Revolving Credit Facility and the Packing Credit Facility including our inability to comply with the financial covenants could result in an event of default there under, which would allow the lenders under the Term Loans, Revolving Credit Facility and the Packing Credit Facility, as applicable, to declare all borrowings outstanding to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger an event of default under the Indenture and, potentially, our other indebtedness. At maturity or in the event of an acceleration of payment obligations, we would likely be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand. We would, therefore, be required to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, terms as favorable as our current agreements or at all, or face bankruptcy. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or find alternative means of financing our operations, we may be required to curtail our operations or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the existing debt.\nIn April 2014, we sold the Senior Notes due 2019 amounting to $325 million through private placement, which together with term loan proceeds of $360 million from a consortium of banks, cash generated by the operations of the Company was used to redeem the entire outstanding existing 9% Senior Notes of $770 million. Despite extinguishment of 9% Senior Notes of $770 million in April, 2014, as of December 31, 2014, the Company still has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could have a material impact on our business and would make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the outstanding debt; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to sell assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes, such as funding our working capital and capital expenditures; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and industry in which we operate; limit our ability to service our indebtedness; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any less leveraged competitors; and prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute a default under the Indenture and debt agreements.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, prospects or ability to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and existing debt.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe depend on capital markets to fund our business and as source of liquidity. Our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings. These ratings are assigned by rating agencies, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including our financial strength. These rating agencies may downgrade our ratings or make negative implications about our business at any time. Credit ratings are also important for our competition in certain markets and when seeking to engage in longer-term transactions, including over-the-counter derivatives. A reduction in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. This, in turn, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect our liquidity. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings may further have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and labor relations. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation.\nViolations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights. In particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in\nthe local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of our subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners and other third parties with which we associate could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including U.S. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation.\nChanges in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, because outsourcing and systems integration represent a significant portion of our business, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our government work, which have been proposed from time to time by various U.S. states, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated, or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. We currently do not have significant contracts with U.S. federal or state government entities.\nAn inability to recruit and retain IT professionals will adversely affect our ability to deliver our services.\nOur industry relies on large numbers of skilled IT employees, and our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain a sufficient number of skilled IT professionals and project managers who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver our services. Qualified IT professionals are in demand worldwide and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. Our failure to attract or retain qualified IT professionals in sufficient numbers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInternational immigration and work permit laws may adversely affect our ability to deploy our workforce and provide services to clients in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions, which could hamper our growth or cause our orders and margins to decline.\nWe operate in twenty seven countries and recruit professionals on a global basis and, therefore, must comply with the immigration and work permit/visa laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate or plan to operate. Most of our projects require a portion of the work to be completed at the client\u2019s location. Understanding changes and issues of immigration laws are critical as it impacts our ability to staff personnel for various projects with certainty and frequency. Immigration laws in the United States and in other countries are subject to legislative change, as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions.\nIt is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or monitoring work visas for our technology professionals in the countries in which we conduct business. Our reliance on work visas for a significant number of technology professionals makes us particularly vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with technology professionals who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of rejections of visa applications. This may affect our ability to get timely visas and accordingly staff projects. As a result, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our technology professionals or may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining the conditions of such visas. Additionally, we may have to apply in advance for visas and this could result in additional expenses during certain quarters of the fiscal year.\nOur earnings may be adversely affected if we receive an adverse determination resulting from tax reviews of our operations.\nWe face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of current taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the amount of deductions, transfer pricing and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. To the extent we are able to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals, our effective tax rates in a given financial statement period may be materially affected. Additionally, we operate in several countries and our failure to comply with the local tax regime may result in additional taxes, penalties and enforcement actions. To the extent we do not comply with tax-related regulations, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur net income could decrease if the government of India reduces or withdraws tax benefits and other incentives it currently provides to us, or otherwise increases our effective tax rate.\nPresently, we benefit from the tax holidays given by the government of India for the export of IT services from specially designated special economic zones (\u201cSEZs\u201d) in India. As a result of these incentives, which include a 10 year tax holiday from Indian corporate income taxes for the operation of most of our Indian facilities, our operations have been subject to relatively low tax liabilities.\nDevelopment centers operating in SEZs are entitled to certain income tax incentives which commence from the date of start of operations of 100% of the export profits for a period of five years, 50% of such profits for the next five years and 50% of the profits for a further period of five years subject to satisfaction of certain capital investments requirements. Our profitability would be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to benefit from these tax incentives.\nFurther, provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act 1961 are amended on an annual basis by enactment of the Finance Act and may result in additional tax liability. We may also be subject to changes in tax rates or liability resulting from the actions of applicable income tax authorities in India or from Indian tax laws that may be enacted in the future. For example, we may incur increased tax liability as a result of a determination by applicable income tax authorities that the transfer price applied to transactions involving our subsidiaries and the Company was not appropriate.\nIncreases in our effective tax rate due to expired tax benefits, changes in applicable tax laws or the actions of applicable income tax or other regulatory authorities could materially reduce our profitability.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant variations.\nOur revenues and operating results are subject to significant variations from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during the quarter, the number of working days in a quarter, employee hiring, attrition and utilization rates and the mix of time-and-material projects versus fixed price deliverable projects and maintenance projects during the quarter. Additionally, periodically our cost increases due to both the hiring of new employees and strategic investments in infrastructure in anticipation of future opportunities for revenue growth. We recognize revenues on time-and-material projects as the services are performed. Revenue related to fixed-price contracts that provide for complex information technology application development services are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method with input (cost to cost) method while contracts that do not provide for complex information technology development services are recognized as the services are performed using proportional performance basis with input (efforts expended) method. Contracts with no stated deliverables, with a designated workforce assigned, recognize revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. Although fixed price deliverable projects have not contributed significantly to revenues and profitability to date, operating results may be adversely affected in the future by cost overruns on fixed price deliverable projects. Because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, variations in revenues may cause significant variations in our operating results.\nWe face intense competition from other service providers.\nWe are subject to intense competition in the industry in which we operate which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We operate in a highly intensive competitive industry which is served by numerous global, national, regional and local firms. Our industry has experienced rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards and customer requirements. The principal competitive factors in the IT markets include the range of services offered, size and scale of service provider, global reach, technical expertise, responsiveness to client needs, speed in delivery of IT solutions, quality of service and perceived value. Many companies also choose to perform some or all of their back office IT and IT-enabled operations internally. Such competitiveness requires us to keep pace with technological developments and maintain leadership; enhance our service offerings, including the breadth of our services and portfolio, and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe market our service offerings to large and medium-sized organizations. Generally, the pricing for the projects depends on the type of contract which includes time and material contracts, annual maintenance contracts (fixed time frame), fixed price contracts and transaction price based contracts. The intense competition and the changes in the general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain services or provide services that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline and may reduce margins and could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of our competitors may bundle software products and services for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain services. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our services or changes in customer demand, our revenues and cash flows could decrease.\nOur competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals. Similarly, if our competitors are successful in identifying and implementing newer service enhancements in response to rapid changes in technology and customer preferences, they may be more successful at selling their services. If we are unable to respond to such changes our results of operations may be harmed. Further, a client may choose to use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm to perform the types of services we provide. We cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or growth in the face of competitive pressures, including competition for skilled technology professionals and pricing pressure from competitors employing an on-site/offshore business model.\nIn addition, we may face competition from companies that increase in size or scope as the result of strategic alliances such as mergers or acquisitions. These transactions may include consolidation activity among hardware manufacturers, software companies and vendors, and service providers. The result of any such vertical integration may be greater integration of products and services that were once offered separately by independent vendors. Our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of such an industry trend, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results, such as reducing our revenue, increasing our costs, lowering our gross margin percentage, and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets.\nThe loss of the services of key members of our Senior Leadership Team could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur success is highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team. These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. Although each executive has entered into an employment agreement containing non-competition, non-disclosure and non-solicitation covenants, these contracts do not guarantee that they will continue their employment with us or that such covenants will be\nenforceable. If we lose the service of any of our key executives, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations and meet our ongoing and future business challenges and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur common stock price is subject to significant volatility which may be affected by various factors, including maintaining effective internal controls.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors could cause the common stock price to fluctuate, including factors such as our financial performance, general conditions in the IT industry or global economy, technological achievements by us and our competitors, the establishment of development or strategic relationships with other companies, strategic acquisitions, new customer orders and contracts, legal proceedings brought against the Company or its officers and significant changes in our senior management team. The market price of our securities could also be materially affected by the accuracy of our financial reporting which is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed circumstances, and fraud. These inherent limitations could lead to internal controls not preventing or detecting all misstatements or fraud, which could harm our reputation. In addition, the stock market in general, and the stock of IT companies, in particular, have, in recent years, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies. Such broad market fluctuations, some of which are outside our control, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nEmployment litigation could result in significant financial or reputational harm to us.\nWe are subject to possible claims by our employees alleging discrimination, sexual harassment, negligence and other similar activities by our employees and to possible claims alleging wrongful termination. In the event that these or similar cases are decided against us, we could not only incur substantial liability but also experience an increase in similar suits and suffer reputational harm. We are unable to predict the financial outcome that could result from these matters at this time, and any views we form as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure in which they could result, could change from time to time as the matters proceed through their course, as facts are established, and various judicial determinations are made. No assurance can be made that these matters will not result in significant financial or reputational harm to us. Further, the litigation process may utilize our cash resources and divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our Company, all of which could harm our business.\nWe may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses.\nWe expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions, intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. Depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates. We also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. Furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire. Ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities. In addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. We may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. We might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition we undertake. We might not achieve our expected return on investment, or may lose money. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from an acquired company, including from terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other\ncircumstances prior to acquiring a company, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. If we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisitions for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services.\nIf we do not effectively manage our anticipated expansion growth by continuing to implement systems enhancements and other improvements, our ability to deliver quality services may be adversely affected.\nWe had experienced growth both organically and inorganically in our operations, however, there is no guarantee that the growth will continue. This uncertainty places significant demands on our management, and our operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services may suffer thereby negatively affecting our brand and operating results. Our anticipated expansion and growth in international markets heightens these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could impact our ability to manage our growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf our Company or its subsidiaries fail to maintain and enhance the brands and the competitive advantages they afford us, demand for our services may be adversely affected.\nIn our pursuit to be a differentiated value provider to clients and better address their business imperatives, we rebranded our identity which is represented by a new logo, and renewed vision, mission and values. The brand identity that we have developed over the years has contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Company brands is critical to expanding our customer base and other strategic partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the IT and IT-enabled services market. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology pioneer and continue to provide high-quality services, which we may not do successfully. If we fail to maintain and enhance our Company brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate and respond to technology advances in our industry and our clients\u2019 industries.\nThe IT and offshore outsourcing services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences and new product introductions. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop IT solutions that keep pace with industry developments. We may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or at all, if these developments are addressed, we will be successful in the marketplace. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA significant number of organizations are attempting to migrate business applications to advanced technologies. As a result, our ability to remain competitive will be dependent on several factors, including our ability to develop, train and hire employees with skills in advanced technologies, breadth and depth of process and technology expertise, service quality, knowledge of industry, marketing and sales capabilities. Our failure to hire, train and retain employees with such skills could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our ability to remain competitive will also be dependent on our ability to design and implement, in a timely and cost-\neffective manner, effective transition strategies for clients moving to advanced architectures. Our failure to design and implement such transition strategies in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we do not or are unable to protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe upon or misappropriate the intellectual property of others.\nOur success depends in part upon certain methodologies and tools we use in designing, developing and implementing applications systems in providing our services. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and intellectual property laws to protect confidential information and intellectual property rights of ours and our third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. At the same time, our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services. Any significant misappropriation, infringement or devaluation of such rights could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLitigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could be time consuming and costly. Although we believe that our services do not infringe or misappropriate on the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business, defense against these claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive and divert our attention and resources from operating our Company. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us could require us to pay a substantial damage award, develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that contain the infringing technology. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur clients\u2019 proprietary rights may be misappropriated by our employees or subcontractors in violation of applicable confidentiality agreements.\nWe require our employees and subcontractors to enter into non-disclosure arrangements to limit access to and distribution of our clients\u2019 intellectual property and other confidential information as well as our own. We can give no assurance that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to enforce our clients\u2019 intellectual property rights. If our clients\u2019 proprietary rights are misappropriated by our employees or our subcontractors or their employees, in violation of any applicable confidentiality agreements or otherwise, our clients may consider us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us.\nFounders and Viscaria Limited, a significant shareholder in our Company, have significant influence over the Company and may have conflicts of interest with us or you in the future.\nSunil Wadhwani and Ashok Trivedi, co-chairmen and the co-founders of IGATE, beneficially own approximately 25.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014, and therefore have significant influence in respect of matters requiring shareholder approval. In 2011, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Viscaria, a company backed by funds advised by Apax Partners LLP and Apax Partners, L.P., pursuant to which we have sold to Viscaria 330,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On November 4, 2014, Viscaria exercised its option to convert its preferred stock into our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, Viscaria\u2019s beneficial ownership of stock represents 28.9% of the common stock. Following this conversion, there were no remaining issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nThe interests of Viscaria and its affiliates may differ from our other stockholders in material respects. For example, Viscaria Limited may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings (including financings that are secured and senior to the notes) or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance\ntheir equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to other stockholders. Viscaria or its affiliates or advisors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, and may from time to time in the future, acquire interests in, or provide advice to, businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. We should consider that the interests of these holders may differ from ours in material respects.\nAny disruption in the supply of power, IT infrastructure and telecommunications lines to our facilities could disrupt our business process or subject us to additional costs.\nAny disruption in basic infrastructure, including the supply of power, could negatively impact our ability to provide timely or adequate services to our clients. We rely on a number of telecommunications service and other infrastructure providers to maintain communications between our various facilities and clients in India, the United States and elsewhere. Telecommunications networks are subject to failures and periods of service disruption which can adversely affect our ability to maintain active voice and data communications among our facilities and with our clients. Such disruptions may cause harm to our clients\u2019 business. We do not maintain business interruption insurance and may not be covered for any claims or damages if the supply of power, IT infrastructure or telecommunications lines is disrupted. This could disrupt our business process or subject us to additional costs, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSystem security risks and cyber-attacks could disrupt our information technology services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nSecurity and availability of IT infrastructure is utmost concern for our business, and securing all critical information and infrastructure necessary for rendering services is also one of the top priorities of our customers.\nSystem security risks and cyber-attacks could breach the security and disrupt the availability of our IT and BPO services provided to customers. Any such breach or disruption could allow the misuse of our information systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us, the loss of existing or potential clients, damage to our reputation and diminished brand value, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur network and our deployed security controls could also be penetrated by a skilled computer hacker or intruder. Furthermore, a hacker or intruder could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of our protected information, including personally identifiable information; deploy malicious software or code like computer viruses, worms or Trojan horses, etc may exploit any security vulnerabilities, known or unknown, of our information system; cause disruption in the availability of our information and services; and attack our information system through various other mediums.\nWe also procure software or hardware products from third party vendors that provides, manages and monitors our services. Such products may contain known or unfamiliar manufacturing, design or other defects which may allow a security breach or cyber-attack, if exploited by a computer hacker or intruder, or may be capable of disrupting performance of our IT services and prevent us from providing services to our clients.\nIn addition, we manage, store, process, transmit and have access to significant amounts of data and information that may include our proprietary and confidential information and that of our clients. This data may include personal information, sensitive personal information, personally identifiable information or other critical data and information, of our employees, contractors, officials, directors, end customers of our clients or others, by which any individual may be identified or likely to be identified. Our data security and privacy systems and procedures meet applicable regulatory standards and undergo periodic compliance audits by independent third parties and customers. However, if our compliance with these standards is inadequate, we may be subject to regulatory penalties and litigation, resulting in potential liability for us and an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are still susceptible to data security or privacy breaches, including accidental or deliberate loss and unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of such data or information. Any breach of such data or information may lead to identity theft, impersonation, deception, fraud, misappropriation or other offenses in which such information may be used to cause harm to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks posed by climate change may materially increase our compliance costs and adversely impact our profitability.\nClimate change vulnerability is posing new threats and opportunities in the economy. Climate change and measures adopted to address it can affect us, our clients and suppliers in many ways, depending on the nature and location of the business, near-term capital expenditure needs, regulatory environments and strategic plans. Generally, climate risks and opportunities for companies fall into four categories:\n\u2022\nPhysical risk from climate change;\n\u2022\nRegulatory risks and opportunities related to existing or proposed green house gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission limits;\n\u2022\nIndirect regulatory risks and opportunities related to products or services from high emitting companies;\n\u2022\nLitigation risks for emitters of green house gas.\nUnmitigated climate change could have severe physical impacts on companies with exposed assets or business operations including IGATE. Major environmental risks and liabilities can significantly impact future earnings.\nIGATE is committed to establish itself as climate responsible organization which conducts its business in a sustainable fashion so as to optimize resources and energy utilization. We ultimately wish to achieve carbon neutrality and position ourselves on a low carbon growth path. As the first step of preparing our action plan for climate change mitigation, we have undertaken a carbon footprint estimation study that determines the GHG inventory covering all of our facilities. In 2008, we began estimating our carbon footprint and GHG emissions. For the period of January, 2011 to June, 2012, our estimated carbon footprint stood at 117,417 tCO2 and carbon intensity stands at 3.29 tCO2/ employee. For the period of July, 2012 to December, 2013, our estimated carbon footprint stood at 122,888 tCO2 and carbon intensity stands at 2.85 tCO2/ employee. The decrease in carbon intensity per employee may be attributable to the various GHG emission mitigations practices, including a certification and energy efficiency improvement programs we adopted.\nTo the extent we are unable to comply with applicable regulations related to climate change, and such failure to comply results in material increases in compliance costs or litigation expenses, those costs or expenses could have an adverse effect on our profitability. If our clients are adversely affected by climate change or related compliance costs, this may reduce their spending and demand for our services, leading to a decrease in revenue.\nIn addition to emissions and climate change risks posed directly to IGATE, we also have clients in varied industries such as financial services, insurance, banking, manufacturing, retail, media and entertainment and healthcare, among others, who may be significantly affected by climate change which could result in greater physical risk to and impact on their operations. This may lead to an overall reduction of demand for our services and loss of business from such clients, which would impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 84320, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "IGTE"}
