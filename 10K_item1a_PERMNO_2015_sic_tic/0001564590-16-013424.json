{"cik": "1093082", "company": "HUTTIG BUILDING PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business and operations.\nAlthough the homebuilding industry is strengthening, any downturn of current construction levels could materially affect our business, liquidity and operating results.\nOur sales and results of operations depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets. The strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects, which are a function of many factors beyond our control. Some of these factors include general economic conditions, employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, prices of commodity wood and steel products, immigration patterns, regional demographics and consumer confidence.\nNew housing activity in the United States has shown modest improvement each year since 2009. However, 2015 activity was still well below the Historical Average of approximately 1.4 million starts. We expect the level of new housing activity in 2016 to continue to be below the Historical Average. A prolonged downturn in current construction levels or any significant downturn in the major markets we serve or in the economy in general could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition, including but not limited to our ability to comply with the financial covenant under our credit facility and the valuation of our goodwill. Reduced levels of construction activity may result in continued intense price competition among building materials suppliers, which may adversely affect our gross margins. We cannot provide assurance that our responses to a downturn or the government\u2019s attempts to address the troubles in the economy will be successful.\nThe industry in which we compete is highly cyclical, and any cyclical market factors resulting in lower demand or increased supply could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe building products distribution industry is subject to cyclical market pressures caused by a number of factors that are out of our control, such as general economic and political conditions, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, levels of new construction, home improvement and remodeling activity, interest rates and population growth. To the extent that cyclical market factors adversely impact overall demand for building products or the prices that we can charge for our products, our net sales and margins would likely decline in the same time frame as the cyclical downturn occurs. Because much of our overhead and expense is relatively fixed in nature, a decrease in sales and margin generally has a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. To the extent our customers experience downturns in their business, our ability to collect our receivables could be adversely affected. Finally, the unpredictable nature of the cyclical market factors that impact our industry make it difficult to forecast our operating results.\nWe face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future. We are required to remediate a property formerly owned by us in Montana pursuant to a unilateral administrative order issued by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cDEQ\u201d). Although we believe we have accurately estimated the cost of implementing the remediation work at the site based on the information we have currently, we cannot provide assurance of the total cost of implementing the final remediation work at the site due to the currently unknown variables relating to the actual levels of contaminants and additional sampling and testing to ensure the remediation will achieve the projected outcome required by the DEQ. Our total cost of implementing the final remediation work at the site may exceed the amounts we have accrued for the matter. In addition, some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred, and for which we, among others, could be held responsible. As a result, we may incur material environmental liabilities in the future with respect to our current or former distribution center locations.\nA number of our employees are unionized, and any work stoppages by our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nApproximately 14% of our employees were represented by labor unions as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had eight collective bargaining agreements. The Company has three union contracts covering approximately 8% of our employees which will require negotiation in 2016. We may become subject to significant wage increases or additional work rules imposed by future agreements with labor unions representing our employees. Any such cost increases or new work rule implementation could increase our operating expenses to a material extent. In addition, although we have not experienced any strikes or other significant work interruptions in recent years and have maintained generally favorable relations with our employees, no assurance can be given that there will not be any work stoppages or other labor disturbances in the future, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to meet the financial covenant under our credit facility, the lenders could elect to accelerate the repayment of the outstanding balance and, in that event, we would be forced to seek alternative sources of financing.\nWe are party to a $160.0 million asset based senior secured revolving credit facility which contains a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (\u201cFCCR\u201d) that is tested if our excess borrowing availability, as defined in the facility, reaches an amount in the range of $12.5 million to $20.0 million depending on our borrowing base at the time of testing. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our FCCR exceeded our threshold of 1:05:1.0. However, if in the future we failed to meet the required FCCR and we were unable to maintain excess borrowing availability of more than the applicable amount in the range of $12.5 million to $20.0 million, our lenders would have the right to terminate the loan commitments and accelerate the repayment of the entire amount outstanding under the credit facility. Our lenders also could foreclose on our assets that secure our credit facility. In that event, we would be forced to seek alternative sources of financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCompliance with the restrictions and the financial covenant under our credit agreement may limit the amount available to us for borrowing under that facility and may limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters.\nThe borrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and property and equipment. We are also subject to certain operating limitations commonly applicable to a loan of this type, which, among other things, place limitations on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, cash dividends, stock repurchases and transactions with affiliates. A minimum FCCR must be tested on a pro forma basis prior to consummation of certain significant business transactions outside the Company\u2019s ordinary course of business. These restrictions may limit management\u2019s ability to operate our business in accordance with management\u2019s discretion, which could limit our ability to pursue certain strategic objectives.\nA significant portion of our sales are concentrated with a relatively small number of customers. A loss of one or more of these customers would have material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nIn 2015, our top ten customers represented 40% of our sales, with one customer accounting for 13% of our sales. This customer is a buying group for multiple building material dealers. Although we believe that our relationships with our customers are strong, the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our sales are on credit to our customers. Material changes in their creditworthiness or our inability to forecast deterioration in their credit position could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe majority of our sales are on account where we provide credit to our customers. In 2015, bad debt expense to total net sales was less than 0.1%. Our customers are generally susceptible to the same economic business risks as we are. Furthermore, we may not necessarily be aware of any deterioration in their financial position. If our customers\u2019 financial positions become impaired, it could have a significant adverse impact on our bad debt exposure and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flow and liquidity.\nFluctuation in prices of commodity wood and steel products that we buy and then resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in wood and steel commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past, and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future. Such changes can adversely affect the gross margins that we realize on the resale of the products. We may be unable to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any negative impact of these changes on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe distribute building materials that we purchase from a number of major suppliers. As is customary in our industry, most of our relationships with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice. More than half of our purchases are concentrated with ten suppliers. Although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that in most cases we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers, the termination of key supplier relationships or any other disruption in our sources of supply, particularly of our most commonly sold items, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties could occur from time to time and could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe building materials distribution industry is fragmented and competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve.\nThe building materials distribution industry is fragmented and competitive. Our competition varies by product line, customer classification and geographic market. The principal competitive factors in our industry are:\n\u00b7\npricing and availability of product;\n\u00b7\nservice and delivery capabilities;\n\u00b7\nability to assist with problem-solving;\n\u00b7\ncustomer relationships;\n\u00b7\ngeographic coverage; and\n\u00b7\nbreadth of product offerings.\nAlso, financial stability is important to manufacturers and customers in choosing distributors for their products.\nWe compete with many local, regional and, in some markets and product categories, national building materials distributors and dealers. In addition, some product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to our customers, and the volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Manufacturers of products distributed by us may also enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with our competition. Further, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, may intensify their marketing efforts to larger contractors and homebuilders. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have retained accident and claims risk under our insurance programs. Significant claims, and/or our ability to accurately estimate the liability for these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe retain a portion of the accident and claims risk under vehicle liability, workers\u2019 compensation, medical and other insurance programs. We have multiple claims of various sizes and forecast the number of claims in determining the portion of accident risk we are willing to self-insure. We base loss accruals on our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and adjust them periodically as circumstances change. Due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, our estimates may change. Changes in the actual number of large claims or changes in the estimates of these accruals may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in any such period.\nIn addition, our insurance underwriters require collateral, generally in the form of letters of credit, which reduce our borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility. Changes in the actual number of large claims could increase our collateral requirements and reduce our borrowing availability under our credit facility.\nFederal and state transportation regulations, as well as increases in the cost of fuel, could impose substantial costs on us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe use our own fleet of approximately 150 tractors, 15 trucks and 300 trailers to service customers throughout the United States. The U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), regulates our operations, and we are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service could increase our costs.\nIn addition, distributors are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and, therefore, are impacted by changes in diesel fuel prices. While fuel costs have been declining over the last several months, fuel costs are largely unpredictable. Fuel costs have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Fuel availability, as well as pricing, is also impacted by political and economic factors. It is difficult to predict the future availability of fuel due to the following factors, among others: dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas; limited refining capacity; and the possibility of changes in governmental policies on fuel production, transportation and marketing. Significant disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative impact on our operations and results of operations.\nOur failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and sales personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur unionized employees generally participate in certain multi-employer pension plans and funding requirements for these plans, particularly underfunded plans, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe participate in various multi-employer pension plans. Some of these multi-employer plans may be underfunded at any point in time. While the underfunded status may be cured in the normal course of plan management, a significant obligation may be created which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or could materially add to the cost of closing or consolidating operating locations.\nWe face the risks that product liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs is the case with other companies in our industry, even though our suppliers generally warrant the products we sell, we face the risk of product liability and other claims of the type that are typical to our industry in the event that the use of products that we have distributed causes other damages. Product liability claims in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not covered under our insurance policies or indemnified by our suppliers, could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other businesses, and, if we do, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, which may impair our financial performance.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities, we may acquire businesses that we believe provide strategic opportunities. If we acquire a business, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. If we make future acquisitions, we may issue shares of stock that dilute the ownership interests of other stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses relating to amortizing intangible assets with estimated useful lives, any of which might harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGoodwill is a significant portion of our total assets and is tested for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material non-cash write-down of goodwill.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment tests at least annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. We have incurred non-cash impairment charges in certain prior years. At December 31, 2015, we reported goodwill of $6.3 million. We may be required to incur additional non-cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur financial results reflect the seasonal nature of our operations.\nOur first and fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases. Because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year, our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters. In addition, other weather patterns, such as hurricane season in the Southeast region of the United States during the third and fourth quarters, can have an adverse impact on our profits in a particular period.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nWe depend on information technology, including our information technology system and third party telecommunications facilities, as an essential element to sustain our operations. Our system enables us to interface with our local distribution centers and customers, as well as to maintain and timely update financial and business records. A failure of the information technology systems used by us or third parties with which we interact could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers or impediments to the shipment of products. In particular a cybersecurity breach could result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property, proprietary information and personal information of our customers and employees. An information technology failure could expose us to financial losses from the need to undertake remedial actions and loss of business or potential liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nOur deferred tax assets could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (collectively, the \u201cDeferred Tax Assets\u201d). Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our Deferred Tax Assets to reduce our future taxable income and tax liabilities until such Deferred Tax Assets expire in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code provide an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our Deferred Tax Assets, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership (as defined under the Code). We may experience a change in ownership in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership that are beyond our control, and any such subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the Code could further limit our ability to use our Deferred Tax Assets. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely impact our ability to offset future tax liabilities and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 87464, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "HBP"}
