{"cik": "18926", "company": "Lumen Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion identifies material factors that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results, projections or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other portions of this annual report, including \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. All references to \"Notes\" in this Item 1A of Part I refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Please note the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that arise in the future or that are not specific to us. In addition, certain of the risks described below apply only to a part or segment of our business.\nBusiness Risks\nWe may not be able to create the global digital experience expected by customers.\nOur customers expect us to create and maintain a global digital experience, including: (i) automation and simplification of our offerings, (ii) customer self-service options and (iii) digital access to our products, services and customer support. To do so, we must complete the digital transformation of our operations that is currently underway. Effective digital transformation is a complex, dynamic process requiring efficient allocation and prioritization of resources, simplification of our product portfolio, faster product deployments, retirement of obsolete systems, migration of data and corresponding workforce and system development. We cannot assure you we will be able to effect the successful digital transformation necessary to develop or deliver a global digital experience expected by our customers. If we are unable to do so, we could lose existing customers or fail to attract new ones, either of which could prevent us from attaining our financial goals.\nChallenges with integrating or modernizing our existing applications and systems could harm our performance.\nTo succeed, we need to integrate, upgrade and evolve our existing applications and systems, including many legacy systems from past acquisitions. We cannot assure you we will be able to integrate our legacy IT systems, modernize our infrastructure, timely retire aging systems or deploy a master data management platform. These modernization efforts will require efficient allocation of resources, development capacity, access to subject-matter experts, development of a sustainable operating model and successful collaboration between legal, privacy and security personnel. Any failure to timely accomplish these initiatives may negatively affect our (i) customer and employee experiences, (ii) ability to meet regulatory, legal or contractual obligations, (iii) network stability, (iv) ability to realize anticipated efficiencies, (v) ability to timely repair infrastructure and respond to service outages or (vi) ability to deliver value to our customers at required speed and scale.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and existing and future competitive pressures could harm our performance.\nEach of our business and mass market offerings faces increasingly intense competition, with increased pressure to be digitally integrated and quick to market, from a wide range of sources under evolving market conditions that have increased the number and variety of companies that compete with us. Some of our current and potential competitors: (i) offer products or services that are substitutes for our traditional wireline services, including wireless broadband, wireless voice and non-voice communication services, (ii) offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (iii) have greater marketing, engineering, research, development, technical, provisioning, customer relations, financial or other resources, (iv) conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than we do, (v) are subject to less regulation than we are, (vi) have stronger brand names, (vii) have deeper or more long-standing relationships with key customers, (viii) might be perceived as having an ESG profile more attractive to customers or employees, or (ix) have larger operations than ours, any of which may enable them to compete more successfully for customers, strategic partners and acquisitions. Competitive pressures have lowered market prices for many of our products and services in recent years and continued competitive pressures will likely place further downward pressure on market pricing.\nOur ability to successfully compete could be hampered if we fail to timely develop and market innovative technology solutions that address changing customer demands.\nThe technology and communications industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes, which are enabling an increasing variety of companies to compete with us. Many of these technological changes are (i) displacing or reducing demand for certain of our services, (ii) enabling the development of competitive products or services, (iii) enabling customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks or (iv) reducing profit margins. For example, as service providers continue to invest in 5G networks and services, their 5G services could reduce demand for our network services. Increasingly, customers are demanding more technologically advanced products that suit their evolving needs. To remain competitive, we will need to accurately predict and respond to changes in technology, to continue developing products and services attractive to our customers, to maintain and expand our network to enable it to support customer demands for greater transmission capacity and speeds, and to discontinue outdated products and services on a cost-effective basis. Our ability to do so could be restricted by various factors, including limitations of our existing network, technology, capital or personnel. If we fail at that, we could lose customers or fail to attract new ones.\nWe may be unable to attract, develop and retain leaders and employees with the right skillsets and technical expertise.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain skilled and motivated leaders and employees who possess the right skillsets and technical, managerial and development expertise to execute on our plans for transformation, innovation and strategic growth. We operate in a highly competitive and expanding industry. We operate with a limited pool of employees and there is competition for highly qualified personnel in certain growth markets. Our competitors periodically target our employees with highly sought-after skills and will likely continue to do so in the future. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employee candidates. We believe some of our competitors with greater resources and fewer cost constraints than us have from time to time been able to offer compensation, benefits or accommodations in excess of what we are able to offer. As a result, we may be unable to cost-effectively hire and retain employees with market-leading skills. There is no assurance our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel will be successful. If we are unable to do so, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our workforce practices, including having the vast majority of our employees work from home. We intend to reopen our offices in 2022 under a \u201chybrid\u201d working environment, meaning that some of our employees will have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time, for the foreseeable future. The hybrid working environment may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in collaboration between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. If our attempts to safely reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment are not successful, our business could be adversely impacted. Additionally, any state or federal vaccine mandate that is upheld by the courts could make it more difficult to retain or attract employees who oppose vaccination mandates and are ineligible for an exemption.\nThe pandemic and other events over the past couple years have increased employees\u2019 expectations regarding compensation, workplace flexibility and work-home balance. These developments have intensified certain of our above-described challenges and made it relatively more difficult for us to attract and retain top talent. We do not expect these developments to have a material adverse impact on us, but we can provide no assurances to this effect.\nWe could be harmed if our reputation is damaged.\nWe believe the Lumen brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help us attract and retain customers and talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with customers or competitors, cyber-attacks or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government investigations or legal proceedings. Similar events impacting one of our competitors could result in negative publicity for our entire industry that indirectly harms our business. We may also experience reputational damage if customers, vendors, employees, advocacy groups, regulators, investors, the media, social media influencers or others criticize our services, operations or public positions.\nOur brand and reputation could be impacted by our public commitments to various corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, including our political contributions, our advocacy positions, and our goals for sustainability, inclusion and diversity. Positions we take or do not take on ESG issues could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers and employees. Similarly, any failure to achieve our ESG commitments could harm our reputation and adversely affect us.\nThere is a risk that negative or inaccurate information about Lumen, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Lumen brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, having a material adverse impact on the value of our securities.\nWe could be harmed by cyber-attacks.\nOur vulnerability to cyber-attacks is heightened by several features of our operations, including (i) our material reliance on our networks to conduct our operations, (ii) our transmission of large amounts of data over our systems and (iii) our processing and storage of sensitive customer data.\nCyber-attacks on our systems may stem from a variety of sources, including fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of foreign nations, third parties, vendors, or employees and attempts by outside parties to gain access to sensitive data that is stored in or transmitted across our network. Cyber-attacks can take many forms, including computer hackings, computer viruses, ransomware, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, or other malicious activities. Cyber-attacks can put at risk personally identifiable customer data or protected health information, thereby implicating stringent domestic and foreign data protection laws. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on them to operate our business. Various other factors could intensify these risks, including, (i) our maintenance of information in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet, (ii) our use of open and software-defined networks, (iii) the complexity of our multi-continent network composed of legacy and acquired properties, (iv) growth in the size and sophistication of our customers and their service requirements, (v) increased use of our network due to greater demand for data services and (vi) our increased incidence of employees working from remote locations.\nLike other prominent technology and communications companies, we and our customers are constant targets of cyber-attacks. Despite our efforts to prevent these events, some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, although thus far none of these breaches has resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that the risk of breaches is likely to continue to increase due to several factors, including the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the wider accessibility of cyber-attack tools. Known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. You should be further aware that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\nCyber-attacks could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt the operations of our customers, (ii) result in the destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our employees, our customers or our customers\u2019 end users, (iii) require us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches, (iv) require us to provide credits for future service to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers; (v) subject us to claims by our customers or regulators for damages, fines, penalties, license or permit revocations or other remedies, (vi) damage our reputation or result in a loss of business, (vii) result in the loss of industry certifications or (viii) require significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems. Any or all of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe could be harmed by outages in our network or various platforms, or other failures of our services.\nWe are also vulnerable to outages in our network, hosting, cloud or IT platforms, as well as failures of our products or services (including basic and enhanced 911 emergency services) to perform in the manner anticipated. These outages or other failures could result in several of the same adverse effects listed above for cyber-attacks, including the loss of customers, the issuance of credits or refunds, and regulatory fines. This vulnerability may be increased by several factors, including aging network elements, human error, changes in our network, the introduction of new products or technologies, vulnerabilities in our vendors or supply chain, aberrant employees and hardware and software limitations. The process for remediating any interruptions, outages, delays or cessations of service could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. Delayed sales, lower margins, fines or lost customers resulting from such disruptions could have a negative impact on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.\nSeveral of our services continue to experience declining revenue, and our efforts to offset these declines may not be successful.\nPrimarily as a result of the competitive and technological changes discussed above, we have experienced a prolonged systemic decline in our local voice, long-distance voice, network access and private line revenues. Consequently, we have experienced declining consolidated revenues (excluding acquisitions) for a prolonged period and have not been able to realize cost savings sufficient to fully offset the decline. More recently, we have experienced declines in revenue derived from a broader array of our products and services. We have thus far been unable to reverse our annual revenue losses (excluding acquisitions). In addition, most of our more recent product and service offerings generate lower profit margins and may have shorter lifespans than our traditional communication services, and some can be expected to experience slowing or no growth in the future. Accordingly, we may not be successful in attaining our goal of achieving future revenue growth.\nOur operations, financial performance and liquidity are materially reliant on key suppliers, vendors and other third parties.\nOur ability to conduct our operations could have a material adverse impact on us if certain of our arrangements with third parties were terminated, including those further described below.\nReliance on other communications providers. To offer certain services in certain of our markets, we must either purchase services or lease network capacity from, or interconnect our network with, the infrastructure of other communications carriers or cloud companies who typically compete against us in those markets. Our reliance on these supply or interconnection arrangements limits our control over the delivery and quality of our services. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that other carriers may be unwilling or unable to continue or renew these arrangements in the future. Those risks are heightened when the other carrier is a competitor who may benefit from terminating the agreement or imposing price increases. Additionally, certain of our operations carry a significant amount of voice or data traffic for other communications providers. Their reliance on our services exposes us to the risk that they may transfer all or a portion of this traffic from our network to alternative networks owned or leased by them, thereby reducing our revenue.\nReliance on key suppliers and vendors. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including fiber optic cable, software, optronics, transmission electronics, digital switches, routing equipment, customer premise equipment, and related components. We also rely on software and service vendors or other parties to assist us with operating, maintaining and administering our business, including billing, security, provisioning and general operations. If any of these vendors experience business interruptions, security breaches, litigation or other issues that interfere with their ability to deliver their products or services on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have led to a shortage of semiconductors and certain other supplies that we use in our business. Thus far, the negative impact of these shortages on our financial results has not been significant. If these shortages intensify, however, it could materially impact our financial results in a variety of ways, including by increasing our expenses, delaying our network expansion plans or interfering with our ability to deliver products and services.\nReliance on key licensors. We rely on key technologies licensed from third parties to deliver certain of our products and services. Our agreements with these licensors may expire or be terminated, and some of the licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Moreover, if we incorporate licensed technology into our network, we may have limited flexibility to deploy different technologies from alternative licensors.\nReliance on key customer contracts. We have several complex high-value national and global customer contracts. These contracts are frequently impacted by a variety of factors that could reduce or eliminate the profitability of these contracts. Moreover, we would be adversely impacted if we fail to renew major contracts upon their expiration.\nReliance on landowners. We rely on rights-of-way, colocation agreements, franchises and other authorizations granted by governmental bodies, railway companies, utilities, carriers and other third parties to locate a portion of our network equipment over, on or under their respective properties. A significant number of these authorizations are scheduled to lapse over the next five to ten years, unless we are able to extend or renew them. Further, some of our operations are subject to licensing and franchising requirements imposed by municipalities or other governmental authorities. Our operations could be adversely affected if any of these authorizations are cancelled, or otherwise terminate or lapse, or if the landowner requests price increases. We cannot assure you we will be able to successfully extend these arrangements when their terms expire, or to enter into new arrangements that may be necessary to implement our network expansion opportunities.\nClimate change could disrupt our operations, cause us to incur substantial additional capital and operating costs or negatively affect our business.\nA substantial number of our domestic facilities are located in coastal states, which subjects them to the risks associated with severe tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, and many other of our facilities are subject to the risk of earthquakes, floods, fires, tornadoes or other similar casualty events. These events could cause substantial damages, including downed transmission lines, flooded facilities, power outages, fuel shortages, network congestion, delay or failure, damaged or destroyed property and equipment, and work interruptions. Due to substantial deductibles, coverage limits and exclusions, and limited availability, we have typically recovered only a portion of our losses through insurance.\nClimate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather events in the future, which would increase our exposure to the above-cited risks and could disrupt our supply chain from our key suppliers and vendors. Also, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment, thereby negatively affecting our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals or regulatory mandates with respect to reducing our impact on the environment could result in the adverse impacts noted above.\nAny additional future acquisitions or strategic investments may not be available on attractive terms and would subject us to additional risks.\nMuch of our past growth is attributable to acquisitions. In an effort to implement our business strategies, we may from time to time in the future attempt to pursue other acquisition or expansion opportunities, including strategic investments. To the extent we can identify attractive opportunities, these transactions could involve acquisitions of entire businesses or investments in start-up or established companies and could take several forms. These types of transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty of identifying appropriate companies to acquire or invest in on acceptable terms, potential violations of covenants in our debt instruments, insufficient revenue acquired to offset liabilities assumed, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, potential infringements, difficulties integrating the new properties into our operations, and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure. Except as required by law or applicable securities exchange listing standards, we do not expect to ask our shareholders to vote on any proposed acquisition.\nAsset dispositions could have a detrimental impact on us or the holders of our securities.\nIn the past, we have disposed of assets or asset groups for a variety of reasons, and currently expect to consummate later this year two pending divestitures discussed elsewhere in this section \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" In addition, we may dispose of other assets or asset groups from time to time in the future. If we proceed with any such other divestitures of assets, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets and operations, which could result in disruptions to our operations or claims for damages, among other things. Moreover, such dispositions could reduce our cash flows available to support our payment of dividends, capital expenditures, pension contributions, debt maturities or other commitments.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its detrimental impact on the worldwide economy, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Variants of the COVID-19 virus pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at expected levels through established processes for an indefinite period of time. Future events regarding the pandemic, which are unpredictable and beyond our control, will likely continue impacting our operations and results by its effects on demand for our products and services and network usage, on our customers\u2019 ability to continue to pay us in a timely manner, on other third parties we rely on, on our workforce, on our performance under our contracts, and on our supply chains or distribution channels for our products and services. In addition, many of our employees continue to face challenges due to pandemic-related financial, family and health burdens that may negatively impact their ability or willingness to remain employed or fully engaged. If the pandemic intensifies or economic conditions deteriorate, the pandemic\u2019s adverse impact on us could become pronounced in the future and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nWe have taken certain precautions due to the uncertain and evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19 that could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe precautionary measures described in this annual report we have taken to safeguard our employees and customers could make it more difficult to (i) timely and efficiently furnish products and services to our customers, (ii) devote sufficient resources to our ongoing network and product simplification projects, (iii) efficiently monitor and maintain our network, (iv) maintain effective internal controls, (v) mitigate information technology or cybersecurity related risks, (vi) maintain a consistent culture and (vii) otherwise operate and administer our affairs. As such, these measures ultimately could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe face other business risks.\nWe face other business risks, including among others:\n\u2022the difficulties of managing and administering an organization that offers a complex set of products to a diverse range of customers across several continents; and\n\u2022the adverse effects of terrorism, rioting, vandalism or social unrest.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to an extensive, evolving regulatory framework that could create operational or compliance costs.\nAs explained in greater detail elsewhere in this annual report, (i) our domestic operations are regulated by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies and (ii) our international operations are regulated by a wide range of various foreign and international bodies. We cannot assure you we will be successful in obtaining or retaining all regulatory licenses necessary to carry out our business in our various markets. Even if we are, the prescribed service standards and conditions imposed on us under these licenses and related data storage, communication and transfer laws may increase our costs, limit our operational flexibility or result in third-party claims.\nWe are subject to numerous requirements and interpretations under various international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, which are often quite detailed and occasionally in conflict with each other. Accordingly, we cannot ensure we will always be considered to be in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time.\nVarious governmental agencies, including state attorneys general with jurisdiction over our operations, have routinely in the past investigated our business practices either in response to customer complaints or on their own initiative, and are expected to continue to do the same in the future. Certain of these investigations have resulted in substantial fines in the past. On occasion, we have resolved such matters by entering into consent decrees, which are court orders that frequently bind us to specific conduct going forward. If breached by us, these consent decrees expose us not only to contractual remedies, but also to judicial enforcement via contempt of court proceedings, any of which could have material adverse consequences. Additionally, future investigations can potentially result in enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements or reputational harm, or could cause us to change our sales practices or operations.\nOur participation in the FCC's CAF Phase II and RDOF programs subjects us to certain financial risks. If we are not in compliance with FCC measures by the end of the CAF Phase II and RDOF programs, we could incur substantial penalties.\nWe provide products or services to various federal, state and local agencies. Our failure to comply with complex governmental regulations and laws applicable to these programs, or the terms of our governmental contracts, could result in us suffering substantial negative publicity or penalties, being suspended or debarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time and in certain instances could lead to the revocation of our FCC licenses. Moreover, certain governmental agencies frequently reserve the right to terminate their contracts for convenience or if funding is unavailable. If our governmental contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from governmental programs or contracts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdapting and responding to changing regulatory requirements has historically materially impacted our operations. We believe evolving regulatory developments and regulatory uncertainty could continue to have a material impact on our business. In particular, our business could be materially impacted if the U.S. Congress amends or eliminates current federal law limitations on the liability of private network providers, such as us, against claims related to third party content stored or transmitted on private networks, as currently proposed by certain governmental officials, legislative leaders and consumer interest groups. We could also be materially affected if currently pending proposals to increase the regulation of internet service providers or to further strengthen data privacy laws are implemented. In addition, federal and state agencies that regulate the support program payments we receive or the fees that we charge for certain of our regulated services can, and from time to time do, reduce the amounts we receive or can charge. The variability of these laws could also hamper the ability of us and our customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies.\nThird-party content stored or transmitted on our networks could result in liability or otherwise damage our reputation.\nWhile we disclaim liability for third-party content in most of our service contracts, as a private network provider we potentially could be exposed to legal claims relating to third-party content stored or transmitted on our networks. Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography. Although we believe our liability for these types of claims is limited under current law, suits against other carriers have been successful and we cannot assure you that our defenses will prevail. Such third-party content could also result in adverse publicity and damage our reputation. Moreover, as noted above, pending proposals to change the law could materially heighten our legal exposure.\nOur pending legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThere are several potentially material proceedings pending against us. Results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. As of any given date we could have exposure to losses under proceedings in excess of our accrued liability. For each of these reasons, any of the proceedings described in Note 18-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items, as well as current litigation not described therein or future litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, operating results, the trading price of our securities and our ability to access the capital markets. We can give you no assurances as to the ultimate impact of these matters on us.\nWe may not be successful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on various patents, copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property rights, as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. For a variety of reasons, however, these steps may not fully protect us, including due to inherent limitations on the ability to enforce these rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have been accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others and will likely face similar accusations in the future.\nWe routinely receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing their intellectual property rights. We are currently responding to several of these notices and claims and expect this industry-wide trend will continue. If these claims succeed, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages, to cease using the applicable technology or to make royalty payments to continue using the applicable technology. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our revenues or profit margins may decline, our operations could be materially impaired or we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Similarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be prohibited, restricted, made more costly or delayed.\nFailure to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could have a material impact on us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 21% of our employees were members of various bargaining units represented by labor unions. Although we have agreements with these labor unions, we cannot predict the outcome of our future negotiations of these agreements. We may be unable to reach new agreements, and union employees may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and increase our costs. Even if we succeed in reaching new or replacement agreements, they may impose significant new costs on us that impair our competitive position.\nOur international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding operations in international jurisdictions in which we provide services. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, trade restrictions, economic sanctions, tax laws, immigration laws, environmental laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Many of these laws are complex and change frequently. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various international jurisdictions or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties or license revocations if we are determined to have violated applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, these laws or regulations may potentially impact our customers and result in foregone business or penalties to us if we fail to comply with any applicable sanctions or restrictions on our activities.\nMany non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations. We are subject to the GDPR of the European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as various other laws governing privacy rights, data protection and cybersecurity laws in other regions. These laws and regulations continue to proliferate and evolve, are becoming more complex and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. Moreover, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain licenses and conduct our operations.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include: economic, social and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest, potential seizure or nationalization of assets; currency and exchange controls, repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including, without limitation, the matters outlined in Note 1-Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Foreign Currency; problems collecting accounts receivable; the difficulty or inability in certain jurisdictions to enforce contract or intellectual property rights; reliance on certain third parties with whom we lack extensive experience; supply chain challenges; and challenges in securing and maintaining the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure.\nOur operations and financial results could be impacted by changes in multilateral conventions, treaties, tariffs or other arrangements between or among sovereign nations, including most recently Brexit.\nFinancial Risks\nOur significant debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12.4 billion of outstanding consolidated secured indebtedness, $17.8 billion of outstanding consolidated unsecured indebtedness (including long-term debt reclassified as liabilities held for sale, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized premiums, net and unamortized debt issuance costs) and $2.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur significant levels of debt and related debt service obligations could adversely affect us in several respects, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives and dividends;\n\u2022hindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases (especially with respect to our variable rate debt);\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged companies;\n\u2022adversely impacting other parties\u2019 perception of Lumen, including but not limited to existing or potential customers, vendors, employees or creditors;\n\u2022making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing or refinancing, including the risk that this could force us to sell assets or take other less desirable actions to raise capital; and\n\u2022increasing the risk that we may not meet the financial or non-financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings or experience any downgrade in our credit ratings or those of our affiliates. Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, the current terms of our debt instruments and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments permit us or them to incur additional indebtedness.\nWe expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe expect to periodically require financing in the future to refinance existing indebtedness and potentially for other purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, and credit ratings, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general market conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, geo-political instabilities, trade restrictions, pandemics, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad, and (ii) specific conditions in the communications industry. Instability in the domestic or global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility and disruptions in capital markets. For these and other reasons, we can give no assurance additional financing for any of these purposes will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to make required debt payments or refinance our debt, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, issuing additional securities, reducing or terminating our dividend payments, cutting or delaying costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our lenders to restructure our applicable debt. Our current and future debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to complete some of these actions on favorable terms, or at all. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you we could implement these steps in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all.\nWe have a highly complex debt structure, which could impact the rights of our investors.\nLumen Technologies, Inc. and various of its subsidiaries owe substantial sums pursuant to various debt and financing arrangements, certain of which are guaranteed by other principal subsidiaries. Almost half of the debt of Lumen Technologies, Inc. is guaranteed by certain of its principal domestic subsidiaries, some of which have pledged substantially all of their assets (including certain of their respective subsidiaries) to secure their guarantees. The remainder of the debt of Lumen Technologies, Inc. is neither guaranteed nor secured. Nearly half of the debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. is (i) secured by a pledge of substantially all of its assets and (ii) guaranteed on a secured basis by certain of its affiliates. The remainder of the debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. is not secured by any of its assets, but is guaranteed by certain of its affiliates. As of the date of this annual report, substantial amounts of debt are also owed by two direct or indirect subsidiaries of Qwest Communications International Inc. and by Embarq Corporation and one of its subsidiaries. Most of the nearly 400 subsidiaries of Lumen Technologies, Inc. have neither borrowed money nor guaranteed any of the debt of Lumen Technologies, Inc. or its affiliates. As such, investors in our consolidated debt instruments should be aware that (i) determining the priority of their rights as creditors is a complex matter which is substantially dependent upon the assets and earning power of the entities that issued or guaranteed (if any) the applicable debt and (ii) a substantial portion of such debt is structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Lumen Technologies, Inc. to the extent of the value of those subsidiaries that are obligors.\nOur various debt agreements include restrictions and covenants that could (i) limit our ability to conduct operations or borrow additional funds, (ii) restrict our ability to engage in inter-company transactions, and (iii) lead to the acceleration of our repayment obligations in certain instances.\nUnder our consolidated debt and financing arrangements the issuer of the debt is subject to various covenants and restrictions, the most restrictive of which pertain to the debt of Lumen Technologies, Inc. and Level 3 Financing, Inc.\nLumen Technologies, Inc.\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and secured notes contain several significant limitations restricting its ability to, among other things, borrow additional money or issue guarantees; pay dividends or other distributions to shareholders; make loans; create liens on assets; sell assets; transact with its affiliates and engage in mergers or consolidations. These restrictive covenants could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate or reconfigure our business, to pursue acquisitions, divestitures or strategic transactions, or to otherwise pursue our plans and strategies.\nThe debt and financing arrangements of Level 3 Financing, Inc. contain substantially similar limitations that restrict their operations on a standalone basis as a separate restricted group. Consequently, certain of these covenants may significantly restrict our ability to receive cash from Level 3, to distribute cash from Level 3 to other of our affiliated entities, or to enter into other transactions among our wholly-owned entities.\nLumen Technologies, Inc.\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes, as well as the term loan debt of Qwest Corporation also contain financial maintenance covenants.\nThe failure of Lumen Technologies, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries to comply with the above-described restrictive or financial covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Certain of our debt instruments have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument.\nOur cash flows may not adequately fund all of our cash requirements.\nOur business is capital intensive. We expect to continue to require significant capital to pursue our Quantum Fiber buildout plans and to otherwise maintain, upgrade and expand our network infrastructure, based on several factors, including (i) changes in customers\u2019 service requirements; (ii) our continuing need to expand and improve our network to remain competitive and meet customer demand; and (iii) our regulatory commitments. We will also continue to need substantial amounts of cash to meet our fixed commitments and other business objectives, including without limitation funding our operating costs, maintenance expenses, debt repayments, tax obligations, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. We cannot assure you our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund all of our cash requirements in the manner currently contemplated.\nAs a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their distribution of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate cash flows in amounts sufficient to fund our obligations, including the payment of our long-term debt. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us, except to the extent they have guaranteed such payments. Similarly, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing or cash management purposes, our subsidiaries have no obligation to make any funds available to us to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein, restrictions imposed by credit instruments or other agreements applicable to Level 3 and certain of our other subsidiaries limit the amount of funds our subsidiaries are permitted to transfer to us, including the amount of dividends that may be paid to us. Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization would be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors. In addition, the laws under which our subsidiaries were organized typically restrict the amount of dividends they may pay. The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds could be further restricted under applicable state or federal tax laws, regulatory orders or regulations. For all these reasons, you should not assume our subsidiaries will be able in the future to generate and distribute to us cash in amounts sufficient to fund our cash requirements.\nWe cannot assure you we will continue paying dividends at the current rates, or at all.\nWe cannot assure you we will continue periodic dividends on our capital stock at the current rates, or at all. From time to time, our board has reduced our dividend rate, including reductions in 2019 and 2013.\nAny quarterly dividends on our common stock and our outstanding shares of preferred stock will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to continue making any future dividend distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change or terminate our dividend practices at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Holders of our equity securities should be aware they have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends.\nSimilarly, holders of our common stock should be aware repurchases of our common stock under any repurchase plan then in effect are completely discretionary and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason regardless of our financial position.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.9 billion of federal Net Operating Losses (\"NOLs\"), which are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. These limitations could restrict our ability to use these NOLs in the amounts we project. In an effort to safeguard our NOLs, we have maintained an NOL rights agreement since February 2019.\nAt December 31, 2021, we also had substantial state NOLs and foreign NOLs which we believe are subject to legal and practical limitations on our ability to realize their full benefit. We cannot assure you we will be able to utilize these NOLs as projected or at all.\nIncreases in costs for pension and healthcare benefits for our active and retired employees may have a material impact on us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our company-sponsored benefit plans that cover our current and former U.S.-based employees had approximately 29,000 active employee participants, approximately 60,000 active and retired employees and surviving spouses eligible for post-retirement healthcare benefits, approximately 63,000 pension retirees and approximately 10,000 former employees with vested pension benefits. As of such date, our domestic pension plans and our other domestic post-retirement benefit plans were substantially underfunded from an accounting standpoint. We also maintain benefit plans for a much smaller base of our non-U.S. employees. The cost to fund the pension and healthcare benefit plans for our active and retired employees has a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining our pension and healthcare plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including investment returns on funds held by our applicable plan trusts; changes in prevailing interest rates and discount rates or other factors used to calculate the funding status of our plans; increases in healthcare costs generally or claims submitted under our healthcare plans specifically; the longevity and payment elections of our plan participants; changes in plan benefits; and the impact of the continuing implementation, modification or potential repeal of current federal healthcare and pension funding laws and regulations promulgated thereunder. If interest rates remain at historically low levels for sustained periods, our plan funding costs could substantially increase. Increased costs under these plans could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments to our pension plans.\nSee Note 11-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information regarding the funded status of our pension plans and our other post-retirement benefit plans.\nLapses in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe maintain (i) disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the accuracy and completeness of our SEC reports and (ii) internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability and compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) of our financial statements. We cannot assure you these measures will be effective. Our management previously identified two material weaknesses that, while successfully remediated during 2019, were costly to remediate and caused us to request an extension in order to timely file our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIf we are required to record additional intangible asset impairments, we will be required to record a significant charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders' equity.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 45% of our total consolidated assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report consisted of goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets reclassified as assets held for sale). From time to time, including most recently in the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020, we have recorded large non-cash charges to earnings in connection with required reductions of the value of our intangible assets. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record additional significant, non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined to have occurred. Any such charges could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.\nWe face other financial risks.\nWe face other financial risks, including among others the risk that:\n\u2022downgrades in our credit ratings or unfavorable financial analyst reports regarding us or our industry could adversely impact the liquidity or market prices of our outstanding debt or equity securities;\n\u2022a change of control of us or certain of our affiliates will accelerate a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness in an amount that we might not be able to repay, or could adversely impact our ability to continue periodic dividends on our capital stock at current rates, or at all;\n\u2022ongoing attempts of the United States, various foreign countries and supranational or international organizations to reform taxes or identify new tax sources could materially impact our taxes, or that one or more of our ongoing tax audits or examinations could result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements; and\n\u2022current inflation could negatively impact (i) our margins if the higher cost of our labor and supplies cannot be offset by us raising our prices or reducing our other expenses; (ii) our revenues if an inflationary environment causes our customers to defer or decrease their expenditures on our products or services; or (iii) our interest costs by causing them to rise should inflation continue.\nPending Divestiture Risks\nThe completion of our pending divestitures are subject to several conditions.\nAs described further in Note 2-Planned Divestiture of the Latin American and ILEC Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, we have agreed to divest our Latin American business and our incumbent local exchange (\u201cILEC\u201d) business conducted within 20 Midwestern and Southern states. The completion of the divestiture of our Latin American business is subject to the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals in the U.S. and certain countries where the Latin American business operates, as well as the satisfaction of various other closing conditions. The completion of the divestiture of our 20-state ILEC business is subject to the receipt of approvals from the FCC, various states and certain other governmental entities, as well as the satisfaction of various other closing conditions. We cannot assure you that these divestitures will be completed in the timeframes anticipated by us or at all.\nThe pendency of the divestitures could adversely affect our business.\nThe pendency of our divestitures could impact us in several ways, including (i) impacting relationships with our customers and vendors, (ii) restricting our operations due to certain specified operating covenants in the purchase agreements, (iii) diverting management\u2019s attention from operating our business in the ordinary course, and (iv) diminishing our ability to retain or attract employees due to concerns over future job security or responsibilities.\nWe may be unable to successfully segregate the divested businesses from our retained business and realize the anticipated benefits of the divestitures.\nUnder each pending divestiture, we have agreed to (i) complete certain restructuring transactions to segregate the divested business from our retained business, (ii) provide certain post-closing transition and commercial services to the purchasers, and (iii) receive certain post-closing services from the purchasers designed to ensure the continuity of services to our retained customers.\nWe anticipate that it will be challenging and time-consuming to segregate the various businesses and provide transition services to the purchasers. Even if we successfully complete both divestitures, we may incur or experience (i) greater tax or other costs or realize fewer benefits than anticipated under the purchase agreements and our post-closing commercial agreements with the purchasers, (ii) operational or commercial difficulties segregating the divested assets from our retained assets, (iii) disputes with the respective purchasers regarding the nature and sufficiency of the transition services we provide or the terms and conditions of our commercial agreements with each respective purchaser, (iv) potential disputes with creditors concerning the pending transactions or use of the proceeds therefrom, (v) higher vendor costs due to reduced economies of scale or other similar dis-synergies, (vi) lower productivity to the extent segregation of the divested businesses distracts or diverts personnel from operating our retained business, (vii) losses or increased inefficiencies from stranded or underutilized assets, (viii) the loss of any customers dissatisfied with our services post-closing, (ix) challenges in retaining and attracting personnel or (x) the loss of vendors or customers due to our inability to assign contracts with their consent.\nThe divestitures will reduce our future cash flows and sales of higher-margin ILEC services. If our remaining business fails to perform as expected, the divestitures could exacerbate certain of the other financial risks specified in this Item 1A, including our ability to fund all of our current cash requirements.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable general economic, societal or environmental conditions could negatively impact us.\nUnfavorable general economic, societal or environmental conditions, including unstable economic and credit markets, or depressed economic activity caused by trade wars, epidemics, pandemics, wars, societal unrest, rioting, civic disturbances, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, environmental disasters, political instability or other factors, could negatively affect our business or operations. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of these general economic, societal or environmental conditions, they could adversely affect demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower-priced products and services or to delay or forego purchases of our products and services for a variety of reasons. Any one or more of these circumstances could continue to depress our revenue. Also, our customers may encounter financial hardships or may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could negatively impact their ability to make timely payments to us.\nShareholder or debtholder activism efforts could cause a material disruption to our business.\nWhile we always welcome constructive input from our shareholders and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders to that end, activist shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over us. Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board and management. These adverse impacts could be intensified if activist shareholders advocate actions that are not supported by other shareholders, our board or management. The recent increase in the activism of debtholders could increase the risk of claims being made under our debt agreements.\nOur agreements and organizational documents and applicable law could similarly limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire us.\nA number of provisions in our organizational documents and various provisions of applicable law or our NOL rights agreement may delay, defer or prevent a future takeover of us unless the takeover is approved by our board. These provisions (which are described further in our Registration Statement on Form 8-A/A filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015) could deprive our shareholders of any related takeover premium.", "PERMNO": 60599, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "CTL"}
