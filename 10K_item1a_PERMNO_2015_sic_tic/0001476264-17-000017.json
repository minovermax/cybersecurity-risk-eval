{"cik": "1476264", "company": "WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully read and consider the risk factors described below as well as other information included in this report and other documents we file with the SEC, as the same may be updated from time to time. Any of these risks, if they actually occur, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us. In any such case, you could lose all or a portion of your original investment.\nRisks Associated with WashingtonFirst\u2019s Common Stock\nEconomic and other factors may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Exchange. In the current economic environment, the prices of publicly traded stocks in the financial services industry have experienced volatility. A variety of factors can affect the market price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock, including its operating and financial performance, strategic actions by our competitors, speculation in the press or investment community, sales of WashingtonFirst common stock by members of the board of directors or management, changes in accounting principles, additions or departures of key management personnel, actions by WashingtonFirst shareholders, general market conditions including fluctuations in interest rates, and legal and regulatory factors unrelated to WashingtonFirst\u2019s performance. These factors can influence both the price of the liquidity of WashingtonFirst\u2019s stock. General market declines or volatility in the future could adversely impact the price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s stock, and the current market price of the stock may not be indicative of future market prices.\nWashingtonFirst is an emerging growth company and its reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nWashingtonFirst is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and it may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while WashingtonFirst is an emerging growth company it will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the SOX; it will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements; it will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to\npublic companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies; and it will not be required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. WashingtonFirst may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2017, though WashingtonFirst may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of its common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case it would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or (ii) if its gross revenues exceed $1 billion in any fiscal year. Investors may find WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock less attractive if WashingtonFirst relies on these exemptions and relief. If some investors find WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and its stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.\nRestrictions relating to the acquisition of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock may discourage acquisition or merger proposals and may adversely affect the market price of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock.\nSome provisions of WashingtonFirst\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of WashingtonFirst, even if the change in control would be beneficial to and desirable by WashingtonFirst shareholders. These provisions, among others, provide for staggered terms for directors, the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval, limitations on affiliated transactions and control share acquisitions, the inability of shareholders to call special meetings, and the requirement that certain transactions such as a merger, share exchange, sale of all or substantially all of WashingtonFirst\u2019s assets must be approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the directors then in office or, if not so approved and recommended, by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of each voting group entitled to vote on such transaction. In addition, certain provisions of state and federal law may also have the effect of discouraging or prohibiting a future takeover attempt in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. To the extent that any of these provisions are perceived to discourage or limit merger or acquisition attempts, they may tend to reduce the market price for WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock.\nFuture sales of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock in the public market could lower its stock price, and any additional capital raised by WashingtonFirst may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders and/or decrease earnings.\nIn order to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, WashingtonFirst may, from time to time take steps in the future to increase its capital, including selling additional shares of common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock in the future, or offer and sell subordinated debt. Such steps could have a dilutive effect on shareholders, limit WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to pay dividends or return capital to shareholders, or otherwise cause WashingtonFirst to incur higher costs and result in reduced earnings. WashingtonFirst cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of its common stock or subordinated debt will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of WashingtonFirst\u2019s common stock.\nThe concentration of WashingtonFirst\u2019s capital stock ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 2, 2017, WashingtonFirst\u2019s directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own approximately 20.70 percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and options exercisable within sixty days. Consequently, WashingtonFirst\u2019s board of directors has significant influence over all matters that require approval by WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions, and it may be unable to pay future cash dividends.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory, statutory and contractual restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital. Its only source of funds with which to pay dividends to its shareholders are dividends received from the Bank, and the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions. If these regulatory requirements are not satisfied, WashingtonFirst will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock.\nRisks Associated With WashingtonFirst\u2019s Business\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry.\nWashingtonFirst faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. In particular, there is very strong competition for financial services in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which it conducts its business. WashingtonFirst competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as other kinds of local and community, super-regional, national and international financial institutions and enterprises that operate offices in its primary market areas and elsewhere. WashingtonFirst\u2019s future growth and success will depend on its ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment.\nMany of WashingtonFirst\u2019s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions and many offer products and services that it does not. Many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, some operate in less stringent regulatory environments. While WashingtonFirst believes it competes effectively with these other financial institutions in its primary markets, it may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread its marketing costs across a broader market. If WashingtonFirst has to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, its net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing clients may reduce or limit WashingtonFirst\u2019s net income and its market share and may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends on interest rates generally, and it may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy.\nThe economy, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and regulatory policies have a significant influence on WashingtonFirst and the industry as a whole. These policies influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits on a national basis, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.\nFederal Reserve monetary policies and the fiscal policies of the federal government have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. WashingtonFirst cannot predict the nature of future monetary and fiscal policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of WashingtonFirst or its subsidiaries.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates it receives on loans and investments and the rates it pays for deposits and other sources of funds. Its net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of its control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. If market interest rates change so that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it earns on loans and investments, our net income could be negatively affected. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our consolidated net revenues (net interest income plus non-interest income) are derived from originating and selling residential mortgages. Residential mortgage lending in general has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods. An increase by the Federal Reserve in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our future loan origination volume, margins, and the value of the collateral securing our outstanding loans, may increase rates of borrower default, and may otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, fluctuations in housing inventory could impact the volume of mortgage loans that we originate. Further, a reduction in housing inventory could result in elevated costs, as a significant amount of loan processing and underwriting that we perform would be to qualifying borrowers for mortgage loan transactions that never materialize.\nChanges in interest rates, particularly by the Federal Reserve, which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures, also affect the value of its loans. In setting its policy, the Federal Reserve may utilize techniques such as: (i) engaging in open market transactions in United States government securities; (ii) setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) changing reserve requirements. These techniques may have an adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or its business and operations. The reduction by the Federal Reserve of its historic levels of securities purchases, or \u201ctapering,\u201d could cause the interest required to be paid by WashingtonFirst on deposits and borrowings to increase leading to a reduction in its net interest margin. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay the principal or interest on existing variable rate loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in WashingtonFirst\u2019s nonperforming assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from its loans, any of which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s results of operations. WashingtonFirst tries to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk, but it is unable to completely eliminate this risk. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions, and may be adversely affected by reductions in Federal spending.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area which are, in turn, dependent to a large extent on the Federal government, particularly its local employment and spending levels. In addition, the banking industry in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, similar to other geographic markets, is affected by general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment and other factors beyond WashingtonFirst\u2019s control. Prolonged continuation of adverse economic and financial conditions or other economic dislocation in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including a substantial reduction in the level of employment or local spending by the Federal government, could cause increases in nonperforming assets, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity and eroding capital. WashingtonFirst cannot assure you that future adverse changes in the economy in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area would not have a material adverse effect on the WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur concentration of loans may create a greater risk of loan defaults and losses.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate collateral. Real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. While we believe that our loan portfolio is diversified, these concentrations expose us to the risk that a decline in the real estate market or in the economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, decrease the value of collateral and reduce loan demand. In that event, Bank\u2019s earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nCommercial, commercial real estate and construction loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate and construction loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in: a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, under guidance adopted by the federal banking regulators, banks that have concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans (other than loans for majority owner occupied properties) would be expected to maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital. We may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our levels of construction, development and commercial real estate loans, which may require us to obtain additional capital sooner than we would otherwise seek it, which may reduce shareholder returns.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of its growth plans, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if it fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.\nThe Company seeks to continue to grow in its existing banking markets (internally and through additional offices) and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise. WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in its market areas and its ability to manage its growth. WashingtonFirst may face risks with respect to future acquisitions, including: the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners; the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced management, opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and generating of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion; WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to finance an acquisition and possible ownership or economic dilution to its current shareholders; and the diversion of WashingtonFirst\u2019s management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses.\nWashingtonFirst may incur substantial costs to expand, and it can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits it seeks. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, there is no assurance that, following any future merger or acquisition, WashingtonFirst\u2019s integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, it will achieve profits comparable to or better than its historical experience.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s recent results may not be indicative of its future results.\nWashingtonFirst may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow its business at all. In the future, WashingtonFirst may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors, such as a generally stable interest rate environment, an improving real estate market, the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities, or the relative resistance of the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to economic downturns. Various factors, including economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to expand its market presence. As our asset size and earnings increase, it may become more difficult to achieve high rates of increase in assets and earnings. Additionally, it may become more difficult to achieve continued improvement in our expense levels and efficiency ratio. We may not be able to maintain the relatively low levels of nonperforming assets that we have experienced. Declines in the rate of growth of income or assets or deposits, and increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may have an adverse impact on the value of\nthe common stock. If WashingtonFirst experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to the fixed nature of certain operating costs.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce its earnings and capital.\nWashingtonFirst maintains an allowance for loan losses which management believes is adequate for absorbing the estimated future losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of WashingtonFirst\u2019s clients relative to their financial obligations with it. The amount of future losses, however, is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions, including changes in interest rates and collateral values, which are beyond WashingtonFirst\u2019s control, and these future losses may exceed its current estimates. There can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of changes in the economic assumptions underlying management\u2019s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy on a national basis or in the Bank\u2019s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. Although WashingtonFirst believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in its loan portfolio, WashingtonFirst cannot predict the amount of such losses or guarantee that its allowance will be adequate in the future. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to maintain sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance.\nWashingtonFirst must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. We face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution, which were heightened with the implementation of the Basel III rule on January 1, 2015 and the phase-in of capital conservation buffer requirement through January 1, 2019. The application of these more stringent capital requirements for WashingtonFirst could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s future growth opportunities, and result in regulatory actions such as a prohibition on the payment of dividends or on the repurchase of shares if it were unable to comply with such requirements.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s primary source of funds is client deposits in the Bank and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. The deposits from the title and escrow agency customers are expected to continue to be an important component of WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit base. Because deposits of title and escrow agency customers are directly related to home sales and refinancing activity, any decrease in this activity would adversely impact WashingtonFirst\u2019s deposit levels. Accordingly, WashingtonFirst may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While WashingtonFirst believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if WashingtonFirst continues to grow and experience increasing loan demand. Should such sources not be adequate, WashingtonFirst may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nFrom time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Such changes could also require us to incur additional personnel or technology costs.\nChanges in federal or state enacted tax rates could impact reported earnings.\nThe net deferred tax asset reported on the Company\u2019s balance sheet generally represents the tax benefit of future deductions from taxable income for items that have already been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The bulk of these deferred tax assets consists of deferred loan loss deductions, deferred compensation related deductions and net operating loss carryforwards for which the associated tax deduction is deferred until payment and other future triggering event. The net deferred tax asset is measured by applying currently-enacted income tax rates to the accounting period during which the tax benefit is expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset was $8.9 million.\nThe President of the United States and some members of Congress have announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the federal corporate income tax rate from its current level of 35%. If this tax rate reduction is enacted, it will result in an immediate impairment of the recorded net deferred tax asset because the future tax benefit of these deferrals would need to be re-measured for the impact of the lower tax rate. Any such impairment would be recorded as a charge to the Company\u2019s earnings and would be recognized in the quarter during which the lower rate is enacted.\nWashingtonFirst is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities and adversely affect its earnings.\nWashingtonFirst and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not WashingtonFirst\u2019s shareholders. These regulations affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on WashingtonFirst, the Bank and their respective operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on WashingtonFirst. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWashingtonFirst depends on the services of key personnel, and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt its operations and result in reduced revenues.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s success depends upon the continued service of its senior management team and upon its ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense. In management\u2019s experience, it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of professional skills and personal attributes necessary for the successful implementation of WashingtonFirst\u2019s strategy. If WashingtonFirst loses the services of one or more of its key personnel, including key client relationship personnel, or is unable to attract additional qualified personnel, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWashingtonFirst depends on technology to compete effectively and may be required to make substantial investments in new technology, which could have a negative effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s operating results and the value of its common stock.\nThe market for financial services, including banking services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, mobile devices, computers, automation and Internet-based banking. This is particularly true for WashingtonFirst, which relies on technology to compete in its market. WashingtonFirst depends on third party vendors for portions of its data processing services. In addition to WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into its operations, its ability to offer new technology-based services depends on WashingtonFirst\u2019s vendors\u2019 abilities to provide and support those services. Future advances in technology may require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect its operating results, and WashingtonFirst\u2019s limited capital resources may make it impractical or impossible for it to keep pace with competitors possessing greater capital resources. WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to compete successfully in its banking markets may depend on the extent to which WashingtonFirst and its vendors are able to offer new technology-based services and on WashingtonFirst\u2019s ability to integrate technological advances into its operations.\nReliance on technology exposes WashingtonFirst to cybersecurity risks.\nWashingtonFirst relies on digital technologies to conduct its operations, and those technologies may be compromised by the deliberate attacks by others or unintentional cybersecurity incidents. Deliberate cybersecurity attacks may seek to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Other events may not seek unauthorized access, but may seek to prevent authorized users to be able to access digital systems, referred to as \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks. A cybersecurity incident of this type, could require WashingtonFirst to incur substantial remediation and increased cybersecurity protection costs, such as implementing new technologies, hiring and training new employees and engaging third party experts and consultants. In addition, WashingtonFirst could become subject to litigation from customers whose sensitive data was obtained without their consent, and to damage to the company\u2019s reputation, which could have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation. From time to time, WashingtonFirst is subject to cybersecurity attacks arising in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, there have been no cybersecurity attacks which would have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition, results of operation or products and services.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support its day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. WashingtonFirst\u2019s operations are exposed to risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including: equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or simple change in their strategic focus. While WashingtonFirst has comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to WashingtonFirst\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations may not generate the cash needed to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding subordinated debt notes may have negative consequences.\nOn October 5, 2015, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with each of sixteen accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\") pursuant to which the Company sold $25 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 2025 (the \"Notes\") to the Purchasers at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Each Purchase Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company, on the one hand, and the respective Purchasers, on the other hand.\nThe Notes were offered and sold in reliance on the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder. Accordingly, the Notes were offered and sold exclusively to persons who are \"accredited investors\" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D.\nThe Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated October 5, 2015 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Trustee will also serve as the initial paying agent and registrar with respect to the Notes.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of or interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWashingtonFirst\u2019s profitability may be significantly reduced if we are not able to sell mortgages.\nCurrently, the Bank generally sells virtually all of the mortgage loans originated by its subsidiary, the Mortgage Company. The profitability of the Mortgage Company depends in large part upon our ability to originate a high volume of loans and to quickly sell them in the secondary market. Thus, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to sell loans into that market.\nThe Mortgage Company\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Some of the largest participants in the secondary market, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are government-sponsored enterprises with substantial market influence whose activities are governed by federal law. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government-sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non-institutional investors or any impairment of our ability to participate in such programs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reported past substantial losses and a need for substantial amounts of additional capital. Such losses were due to these entities\u2019 business models being tied extensively to the U.S. housing market which severely contracted during the recent economic downturn. In response to the deteriorating financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the U.S. housing market contraction, Congress and the U.S. Treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these entities. The FHFA was established in July 2008 pursuant to the Regulatory Reform Act in an effort to enhance regulatory oversight over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal conservatorship in September 2008. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have returned to profitability as a result of the housing market recovery, but their long-term financial viability is highly dependent on governmental support. If the governmental support is inadequate, these companies could fail to offer programs necessary to an active secondary market. In addition, future policies that change the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government, including those that result in their winding down, nationalization, privatization, or elimination may have broad adverse implications for the residential mortgage market, the mortgage-backed securities market and the Mortgage Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition. If this were to occur, the Mortgage Company\u2019s ability to sell mortgage loans readily could be hampered, and the profitability of the Bank could be significantly reduced.\nChanges in fee structures by third party loan purchasers and mortgage insurers may decrease our loan production volume and the margin we can recognize on conforming home loans, and may adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn the future, third party loan purchasers may revise their fee structures and increase the costs of doing business with them. Such changes may have a negative impact on our ability to originate loans to be sold because of the increased costs of such loans and may decrease our profitability with respect to loans held for sale. In addition, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these third party loan purchasers could negatively impact our results of business, operations and cash flows.\nIf we breach any of the representations or warranties we make to a purchaser or securitizer of our mortgage loans, we may be liable to the purchaser or securitizer for certain costs and damages.\nWhen we sell or securitize mortgage loans in the ordinary course of business, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our agreements require us to repurchase mortgage loans if we have breached any of these representations or warranties, in which case we may be required to repurchase such loan and record a loss upon repurchase and/or bear any subsequent loss on the loan. We may not have any remedies available to us against a third party for such losses, or the remedies available to us may not be as broad as the remedies available to the purchaser of the mortgage loan against us. In addition, if there are remedies against a third party available to us, we face further risk that such third party may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from a third party and may be required to bear the full amount of the related loss.\nIf repurchase and indemnity demands increase on loans that we sell from our portfolios, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe may face risk of loss if we purchase loans from a seller that fails to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nWe generally receive representations and warranties from the originators and sellers from whom we purchase loans such that if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of such representations and warranties, we may be able to pursue a remedy against the seller of the loan for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan. However, if the originator and/or seller breach such representations and warranties and does not have the financial capacity to pay the related damages, we may be subject to the risk of loss for such loan as the originator or seller may not be able to pay such damages or repurchase loans when called upon by us to do so.\nWashingtonFirst may not be able to expand its wealth advisory services and retain current clients.\nWashingtonFirst and its subsidiary Wealth Advisors, may not be able to attract new and retain current investment advisory clients due to competition from the following: commercial banks and trust companies; mutual fund companies; other investment advisory firms; law firms; brokerage firms; and other financial services companies. Their ability to successfully attract and retain clients is dependent upon their ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. Due to changes in economic conditions, the performance of Wealth Advisors may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in which investment clients\u2019 assets are invested, causing clients to seek other alternative investment options. If Wealth Advisors is not successful, the Company\u2019s results from operations and financial position may be negatively impacted.\nWashingtonFirst depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, WashingtonFirst may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. WashingtonFirst also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, WashingtonFirst expects that a customer\u2019s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. WashingtonFirst\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on customer-provided financial statements or other information which are discovered to be materially misleading.\nWashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if it is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of WashingtonFirst\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. WashingtonFirst relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of WashingtonFirst\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default\noccurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, WashingtonFirst may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and may suffer a loss.\nWashingtonFirst is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of its business, WashingtonFirst may foreclose and take title to real estate, potentially becoming subject to environmental liabilities associated with the properties. WashingtonFirst may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs or it may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. Costs associated with investigation or remediation activities can be substantial. If WashingtonFirst or the Bank is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to statutory and/or common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. These costs and claims could adversely affect WashingtonFirst\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 13713, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WFBI"}
