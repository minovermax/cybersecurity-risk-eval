Additionally, several new or refurbished conventional tissue machines have been installed or announced, including as a result of foreign competitors increasing their presence and operations in North America. We believe that increasing tissue capacity, together with intensifying competition experienced by our retail customers, has made it difficult for us to pass through to our customers the significant increases in input costs we have experienced in the last several years. If demand for tissue products in the North American market does not increase or consumer purchasing of premium and ultra-quality tissue do not increase commensurate with the increased capacity, the increase in supply of ultra-quality tissue products could have a material adverse affect on the price of premium and ultra-quality tissue products. In addition, increased supply of premium and ultra-quality tissue may adversely affect the market prices for such tissue and result in the displacement of demand for conventional tissue, which could adversely affect the market price for conventional tissue products, which will continue to represent a significant portion of our total production for the foreseeable future.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from, or changes in prices in regards to, any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a substantial amount of revenues from a concentrated group of customers. For example, our top 10 consumer products customers in 2018 accounted for approximately 80% of our total consumer products net sales. We have experienced increased price and promotion competition in our consumer products business, particularly in regards to ultra-quality products, and this competition has decreased our gross margins and adversely affected our financial condition. Our paperboard sales are also concentrated, with the top 10 paperboard customers in 2018 accounting for approximately 40% of our total paperboard net sales. If we lose any of these customers or a substantial portion of their business or if the terms of our relationship with any of them becomes less favorable to us, our net sales would decline, which would harm our results of operations and financial condition. Some of our customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products that they purchase from us.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them. In addition, our agreements with our customers, including our largest customers, are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments. Our relationship with our largest and most important customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices. If we lose one or more of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed. In the third quarter of 2017, our largest tissue customer made the decision to go from a single source model to a multi-source model for its private label tissue supply beginning in the first quarter of 2018, which significantly affected sales volumes for our conventional tissue in 2018.\nCompetitors' branded products and private label products could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur consumer products compete with well-known, branded products, as well as other private label products. Our business may be harmed by new product offerings by competitors, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do. If we are unable to offer our existing customers, or new customers, tissue products comparable to branded products or other companies' private label products in terms of quality, customer service, and/or price, we may lose business or we may not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower-margin products, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging retail purchasing patterns have increased the need to increase operating efficiencies and diversify our customer base and sales channels.\nWe have historically sold a majority of our consumer tissue products through retail grocery stores. These and other traditional retail outlets are facing increasingly intense competition from supercenters, club stores, wholesale grocers, and drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, as well as competitors who have incorporated the internet as a direct-\nto-consumer channel and internet-only providers that sell tissue and other grocery products. The intense competition faced by our customers has resulted in increased efforts by them to reduce costs from suppliers like us and requires that we become more cost efficient in order to maintain our market share and profitability. The changing retail landscape also requires that we develop and maintain relationships with a wider variety of retailers and retail channels to succeed in this dynamic environment.\nThe expansion of our business through the construction of new tissue making and converting facilities may not proceed as anticipated.\nIn connection with our long-term expansion strategy, we are adding a paper machine capable of producing certain premium and ultra-premium quality tissue products, and have added converting facilities to our Shelby, North Carolina site. The tissue machine being installed in North Carolina is highly complex and costly and it can be manufactured by only one company in the world. Installing this machine and building the supporting facilities entails numerous risks, including difficulties in completing the project on time due to construction or permitting issues, cost overruns, difficulties in integrating the new operations and personnel, and uncertainties regarding the existence of sufficient customer demand and acceptance of the quality of the tissue produced once the new paper machine becomes operational. Any of these risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, such events could also divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We did experience significant cost overruns for the Shelby expansion in 2018.\nConsolidation in the North American paperboard and converting industry may adversely affect our business.\nThe ongoing consolidation of paperboard and paperboard converting businesses, including through the acquisition and integration of such converting businesses by larger competitors of ours, could result in a loss of customers and sales in our pulp and paperboard business. A loss of paperboard customers or sales as a result of consolidations and integrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operational efficiency optimization and cost-saving goals may not be fully achieved or may not support the level of investment or commitment we are making.\nOur near term strategy of improving our competitive position by investing to achieve increased operational efficiencies and implementing cost control measures may not be fully achieved. Those goals, along with the capital projects we have invested in or are investing in to help achieve these goals, including the recently installed continuous digester at our Lewiston facility and warehouse automation at several facilities, may not achieve expected operational or financial results in the time frames we anticipate, or at all. Such delays or failures could materially affect our business, cash flows and financial condition. The continuous digester in Lewiston is currently delivering significantly less in expected financial benefits and we continue to work to achieve the expected operational and financial benefits of the digester project.\nOur business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 48% of our full-time employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us. In 2018 and 2017, collective bargaining agreements for hourly employees at our Lewiston, Idaho facility, which affects approximately 945 employees, expired and are currently being re-negotiated. Any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on external sources of wood pulp and wood fiber for a significant portion of our tissue production, which subjects our business and results of operations to potentially significant fluctuations in the price of market pulp and wood fiber.\nOur Consumer Products segment sources a significant portion of its wood pulp requirements from external suppliers, which exposes us to price fluctuation. In 2018, we sourced approximately 49% of our pulp requirements for tissue manufacturing externally, comprising approximately 10.9% of our consolidated net sales.\nPulp prices can, and have, changed significantly from one period to the next. The volatility of pulp prices can adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trails the increases in pulp prices. In 2018, we were largely unable to pass on these pulp price increases to our customers due to competitive conditions in the consumer tissue industry.\nWood fiber is the principal raw material used to create wood pulp, which in turn is used to manufacture our pulp and paperboard products and consumer products. In 2018, our wood fiber costs were 9.6% of our consolidated net sales. Wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences, and our cost of wood fiber may increase in the areas our pulp and paperboard facilities are located due to market shifts in those regions. For example, much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process in Lewiston, Idaho, is the by-product of sawmill operations. As a result, the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry. Significant reductions in home building during the past decade resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many sawmills and consolidation amongst suppliers. Further, the expansion of operations and production of other paper mills and wood pellet manufacturers in the Inland Northwest region of the United States has increased the demand and price for wood fiber. Additionally, the ability of paper and wood pellet mills in British Columbia to acquire wood fiber from the U.S. Inland Northwest region with limited to no reciprocal ability by U.S. mills to acquire wood fiber from British Columbia, reduces the supply of, and increases the costs, for wood fiber. The price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile.\nThe primary source for wood fiber is timber, the availability of which may be limited by adverse weather, fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, flooding and other natural and man-made causes, thereby reducing supply and increasing prices. For example, our Arkansas pulp and paperboard facility relies on whole log chips for a significant portion of its wood fiber, and in the past this facility has experienced increases in the costs for wood fiber due to extremely wet conditions in the Southeastern U.S. that limited accessibility and availability.\nThe effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects or from environmental litigation or regulation are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations. Additionally, wood pellet facilities or fluff pulp facilities, can increase demand and prices for wood fiber. If we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all, our costs will increase and our operations and financial results may be harmed.\nDisruptions in transportation services or increases in our transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, particularly our consumer products business, is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us as well as for intercompany shipments of parent rolls. Shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed or disrupted due to weather conditions, labor shortages or strikes, regulatory actions or other events. If our transportation providers are unavailable or fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may incur increased costs and we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis.\nThe costs of these transportation services are also affected by geopolitical and economic events. In 2018, our transportation costs were 11.9% of our consolidated net sales, with those costs spiking in the second half of 2018 as the result of higher line haul rates, diesel prices and weather related events. We have not been able in the past, and may not be able in the future, to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers. If we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel or transportation costs, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected.\nUnited States and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results.\nU.S. and global economic conditions and currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our business and financial results. Recessed global economic conditions and a strong U.S. dollar can affect our business in a number of ways, including causing declines in global demand for consumer tissue and paperboard, and increased competition from foreign manufacturers in the U.S. market.\nWe incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance.\nWe regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities. The machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex, have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis. We must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors, pumps, pipes and electrical parts. In addition, our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance. These scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which they occur and could result in unexpected operational issues in future periods as a result of changes to equipment and operational and mechanical processes made during the shutdown period. We had two scheduled major maintenance shutdowns in 2017, which occurred during the second quarter at our Arkansas facility and the third quarter at our Lewiston, Idaho pulp and paperboard facility. We did not have any major\nmaintenance shutdowns in 2018, but in 2019 we expect to have scheduled major maintenance at our Arkansas facility in the fourth quarter and at our Idaho facility in the third quarter.\nUnexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities. For example, we had a fire at our Shelby, North Carolina facility in the first quarter of 2017 and the impregnation vessel that feeds our continuous digester at our Idaho facility plugged in the fourth quarter of 2018. Disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances, including prolonged power outages, mechanical or process failures, shortages of raw materials, natural catastrophes, disruptions in the availability of transportation, labor disputes, terrorism, changes in or non-compliance with environmental or safety laws and the lack of availability of services from any of our facilities' key suppliers. Any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes, including petroleum-based polyethylene and certain petroleum-based latex chemicals. In 2018, our chemical costs were 10.0% of our consolidated net sales. Prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile. In addition, chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to supply shortages and cost increases, ration the amount of chemicals available to us, and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business, if we are able to obtain them at all.\nOur manufacturing operations also utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas. In 2018, our energy costs were 4.9% of our consolidated net sales. Energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade, which in turn affects our cost of sales. For example, we experienced a dramatic spike in prices for natural gas at our Lewiston, Idaho facility in the first quarter of 2019 due to frigid temperatures in the Pacific Northwest as well as due to limited capacity on a major pipeline that supplies the Pacific Northwest resulting from damage to that pipeline that occurred in Canada. We purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products, and, as a result, the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand, geopolitical events, government regulation, weather, interruptions in pipeline and other delivery systems and natural disasters. Our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally, on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage. Any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation and our business.\nLarger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products.\nOur consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products. Our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers, such as Procter & Gamble, and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products, such as Georgia-Pacific and Kimberly-Clark. These companies are far larger than us, have more sales, marketing and research and development resources than we do, and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale. In addition, because of their size and resources, these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete.\nOur ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors, including manufacturing capacity, general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes. Our pulp and paperboard business competes with WestRock, Georgia-Pacific, and international producers, most of whom are much larger than us. Any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry, which could cause downward pressure on pricing. For example, several newer facilities in China have large paperboard manufacturing capacities, the output of which increases paperboard supplies on the international market. Also, a large European manufacturer recently completed a paperboard facility that exports into the North American market and a another has converted a U.S. facility into a facility that produces SBS paperboard for the North American market. Increased production by foreign manufacturers may result in increased competition in the North American paperboard markets from direct sales by foreign competitors into these markets or increased competition in the U.S. as domestic manufacturers seek increased U.S. sales to offset displaced overseas sales caused by increased sales by foreign suppliers into Asia and European markets. Furthermore, customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials, such as plastic, for their products. An increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nCyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flows of our pulp and paperboard business.\nOur pulp and paperboard business has historically been affected by cyclical market conditions. We may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand, and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime. In addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes, production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels. Our results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness. We are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand.\nWe rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition.\nWe use information technology, or IT, systems in various aspects of our operations, including enterprise resource planning, or ERP, management of inventories and customer sales. Some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time. We have different legacy IT systems that we are continuing to integrate. If one of these systems was to fail or cause operational or reporting interruptions, or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems, we may suffer disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing and sales operation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems.\nWe may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer pension plans; one of the plans in which we participate is in \u201ccritical and declining\u201d financial status and this subjects us to potential liabilities, particularly if we withdraw from this plan.\nWe contribute to two multiemployer pension plans. The amount of our annual contributions to these plans is negotiated with the union representing our employees covered by the plan. In 2018, we contributed approximately $6 million to these plans. If in future years we continue to participate in these plans, we may be required to make increased annual contributions, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. The decision whether to continue to participate in these multiemployer plans does not rest solely with us; rather, it is negotiated as part of the collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these plans. There are risks associated with both continuing to participate in multiemployer plans and with withdrawing from multiemployer plans.\nIf we were to withdraw partially or completely from a multiemployer plan that is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan's unfunded vested benefits as required by law. This is called a withdrawal liability.\nIf we continue to participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the future increases in annual contributions are difficult to predict and largely beyond our control. For example, if any other contributing employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan that is underfunded, and the withdrawing employer cannot satisfy its withdrawal liability, then the proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits that would be allocable to us and to the other remaining contributing employers would increase.\nOne of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, the PACE Industry Union-Management Pension Fund, or PIUMPF, was certified to be in \u201ccritical status\u201d for the plan year beginning January 1, 2010 and continued to be in critical status through the plan year beginning January 1, 2014. For the plan years beginning January 1, 2015 through\nJanuary 1, 2018, PIUMPF was certified to be in \"critical and declining status\" under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. The number of employers participating in PIUMPF fell from 135 during 2012 to 78 during 2017 and the ratio of inactive participants to active employees participating in PIUMPF has increased from 3.4 inactive participants per each active employee at the end of 2013 to 10.1 inactive participants per each active employee at the end of 2017. PIUMPF predicts it will become insolvent in 2031. We believe we are now the largest contributing employer remaining in PIUMPF. We therefore expect that if we remain in PIUMPF our annual contributions could increase, although we have no way of knowing by how much.\nIf instead we were to withdraw from PIUMPF, either completely or partially, we would incur a statutory withdrawal liability based on our proportionate share of PIUMPF\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on information available to us, as well as information provided by PIUMPF, and reviewed by our actuarial consultant, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2018, the withdrawal liability payments that we would be required to make to PIUMPF were we to completely withdraw in 2019 would be approximately $5.7 million per year on a pretax basis. These payments would continue for 20 years with an estimated present value in excess of $78 million on a pre-tax basis. If we were deemed to be included in a \u201cmass withdrawal\u201d from PIUMPF, these payments could continue indefinitely.\nWere we voluntarily to withdraw from PIUMPF in 2019 or later, we could be subject to substantial payments in addition to the withdrawal liability payments described above. As a plan in critical and declining status, PIUMPF has adopted a rehabilitation plan. That plan purports to require a withdrawing employer to make an additional, lump-sum payment - above and beyond the statutory withdrawal liability - based on PIUMPF\u2019s accumulated funding deficiency, or AFD. We do not believe PIUMPF\u2019s purported imposition of the AFD on withdrawing employers is legally enforceable. However, we are aware that one large employer that withdrew from PIUMPF has recognized a liability for payment of an AFD amount and that other withdrawing employers may have paid some amounts in respect to the AFD. There have been and continue to be lawsuits in federal courts challenging PIUMPF\u2019s AFD. Some of this litigation has ended without resolving the issue. At least one lawsuit currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho challenges the legality of the AFD; certain claims made in that suit have been dismissed but the court has allowed the plaintiff to amend its complaint to allege claims that the imposition of the AFD assessment did not constitute a reasonable measure under a rehabilitation plan. There are also efforts underway in the United States Congress intended to address the financial situation of multiemployer plans, like PIUMPF, that are in critical and declining status. It is uncertain whether such efforts will result in new legislation or if any new legislation will affect PIUMPF\u2019s financial status.\nIf the AFD were held to be legally enforceable, and if we were to elect to withdraw in some future year, the amount of our AFD liability at the time of our withdrawal would be material and subject to a variety of factors including without limitation the nature and timing of a withdrawal, the solvency or insolvency of PIUMPF at the time of the withdrawal, the level of contributions to the plan made by other contributing employers before our withdrawal, whether any employers that had withdrawn in the intervening years had made AFD payments, and the effect of any Congressional action to assist the funding of multiemployer plans.\nWe believe that the AFD, if held to be lawful, would be assessed only if an employer voluntarily withdraws from PIUMPF and that plan insolvency or any other circumstance that does not involve a voluntary withdrawal by us would not require us to make a payment in respect of the AFD. Therefore, since we currently have no plans to withdraw from PIUMPF, we have not recognized any liability associated with a withdrawal from PIUMPF in our consolidated financial statements.\nIf we were to decide to withdraw voluntarily from PIUMPF in the future, and if the AFD were held to be enforceable against us, the resulting liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. Similarly, if, in the absence of a voluntary withdrawal by us, our understandings (stated above) are incorrect regarding the unenforceability of the AFD or the inapplicability of the AFD to us in the event of plan insolvency or other circumstances not involving a voluntary withdrawal by us, the resulting liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows.\nAdverse changes to, or requirements under, pension laws and regulations or adverse changes, requirements or claims pursuant to PIUMPF\u2019s rehabilitation plan, such as the AFD, could increase the likelihood and amount of our liabilities. Were PIUMPF to fail, or were we to withdraw from PIUMPF, these liabilities would be in addition to the pension contributions we would have to make to any new pension plan adopted or contributed to by us to replace PIUMPF. All of this could materially reduce the cash we would have available for business and other needs.\nOur company-sponsored pension plans are currently underfunded, and we may be required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing cash available for our business.\nWe have company-sponsored pension plans covering certain of our salaried and hourly employees. The volatility in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by these plans, coupled with a low interest rate environment resulting in higher liability valuations, has caused these plans to be underfunded as the projected benefit obligation has exceeded the aggregate fair value of plan assets by varying year-end amounts since 2008. At December 31, 2018, and 2017, our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded in the aggregate by $25.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively. As a result of underfunding, we may be required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. In 2018, we made no contributions to these pension plans, and we are not required to make contributions in 2019.\nWe are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulatory activity at the state, federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites, such as water quality standards based on elevated fish consumption rates. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part or even the curtailment of certain of our manufacturing operations.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits. In particular, the pulp and paper industry in the United States is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes. Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities, which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits. Failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures, install pollution control equipment, or take other remedial actions, such as product recalls or labeling changes. We also may be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis. There can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe own properties, conduct or have conducted operations at properties, and have assumed indemnity obligations for properties or operations where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years, including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary. Consequently, we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances and to liability for other potential violations of environmental laws or permits at existing sites or ones for which we have indemnity obligations.\nOur pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors that could cause these costs to change.\nIn addition to our pension plans, we provide health care benefits to certain of our current and former salaried and hourly employees. There is a risk of increased costs due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and required coverage. Our health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally, which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and mortality rates could also increase pension costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face cyber-security risks.\nOur business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, our information technology systems could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, which could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials required for the production of our products.\nOur dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers, and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules. We cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. Although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials, we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could interrupt production of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe May Fail to Attract, Motivate, Train and Retain Qualified Personnel, Including Key Personnel\nOur ability to effectively run our business depends on our ability to attract, motivate, train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the competitive markets in which we operate. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience. Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. If we fail to attract, motivate, train and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive turnover, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. The loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Our failure to identify candidates with the leadership skills to manage our organization, and our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key executives, could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nExpansion of our business through construction of new facilities or acquisitions may not proceed as anticipated.\nIn the future, we may build other converting and papermaking facilities, pursue acquisitions of existing facilities, or both. In addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash and short-term investments, an increase in our indebtedness, or both, and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management's attention from other business concerns.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weaknesses have led to a conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls. As disclosed in more detail under \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in Part II, Item 9A of this Report, we have identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2018 in our internal control over financial reporting. Due to these material weaknesses, we have also concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018.\nFailure to have effective internal control over financial reporting and ineffectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and could lead to a\nrestatement of our financial statements. If, as a result of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we cannot provide reliable financial statements, our business decision processes may be adversely affected, our business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.\nIf we fail to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to rely on the integrity of our financial results, which could result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results, as well as the inability to meet on a timely basis our reporting obligations or to comply with SEC rules and regulations. Any of these could result in delisting actions by the New York Stock Exchange, investigation and sanctions by regulatory authorities, or an event of default under our debt instruments, and adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nTo service our substantial indebtedness, we must generate significant cash flows. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $796 million of outstanding indebtedness, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured revolving credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our senior secured revolving credit facilities and our outstanding notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe indenture for our outstanding notes that we issued in 2013 and the credit agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities, contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe indenture governing our outstanding notes that we issued in 2013 and the credit agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities, contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nundergo a change in control;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in new lines of business; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our discretion could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities, or to borrow in order to fund further capital expenditures. In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facilities require, among other things, that we maintain a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 through December 31, 2019 and of 1.50 to 1.00 from March 31, 2020 and thereafter, a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00, and a minimum consolidated asset coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured revolving credit facilities or the indentures governing our outstanding notes, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated.\nIf we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes, our senior secured revolving credit facilities or our other debt instruments, an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur. If an event of default does occur, it could trigger a default under our other\ndebt instruments, prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings, and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt. Even if we were able to secure additional financing, it may not be available on favorable terms.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board of Directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nallowing only our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 92854, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "CLW"}
