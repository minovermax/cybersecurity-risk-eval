{"cik": "84748", "company": "ROGERS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our stock. The risks discussed below are those that we believe are currently the most significant, although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nFailure to capitalize on, or volatility within, the Company\u2019s growth drivers, including advanced connectivity and advanced mobility, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe derived approximately 28% and 25% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 from sales relating to the key market growth drivers of advanced connectivity and advanced mobility, respectively. These growth drivers are served by our direct and indirect customers in a variety of end markets, including transportation (specifically including the advanced driver assistance systems and electric and hybrid electric vehicles markets), communications, wireless infrastructure and portable electronics. These growth drivers, as well as specific market and industry trends within them, may be volatile, cyclical and sensitive to a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, technology disruptions, consumer preferences and political priorities. Adverse or cyclical changes to and within these growth drivers has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for certain of our products, production overcapacity, increased inventory levels and price erosion, ultimately leading to a decline in our revenues and gross margins. Acceleration within these growth drivers and corresponding rapid increases in demand for certain products may require us to make significant capital investments or acquisitions in order to increase production levels and to maintain customer relationships and market positions. We may not in all circumstances be able to increase our production levels with sufficient speed or efficiency to capitalize fully on such increases in demand.\nWe have extensive international operations, and events and circumstances that have general international consequence or specific impact in the countries in which we operate may materially adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 71% of our net sales resulted from sales in foreign markets, with approximately 48% and 22% of such net sales occurring in Asia and Europe, respectively. We expect our revenues in foreign markets to continue to represent a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales. We maintain significant manufacturing and administrative operations in China, South Korea, Germany, Hungary and Belgium, and approximately 63% of our employees are located outside the United States. Risks related to our extensive international operations include the following:\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, particularly in the value of the Euro, the Hungarian forint, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan and the South Korean won against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability, due to regional or country-specific events or changes in relations between the United States and the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\naccounts receivable practices across countries, including longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nexport control or customs matters and changes in trade policy, tariff regulations or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ncomplications in complying with a variety of foreign laws, including unexpected changes in the laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nemployment regulations, work stoppages and labor and union disputes.\nThe foregoing risks may be particularly acute in markets such as China and India, where our operations are subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of the economic, legal and governmental systems of these countries. In addition, our business has been - and may continue to be - adversely affected by the lack of development, or disruptions, of transportation or other critical infrastructure in emerging markets. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, it may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon our development of innovative products and our customers\u2019 incorporation of those products into end user products and systems that achieve commercial success.\nAs a manufacturer and supplier of engineered materials and components, our business depends upon our ability to innovate and sell our new and improved materials and components for inclusion in other products that are developed, manufactured and sold by our customers. We strive to differentiate our products and secure long-term demand through our engagement with our customers to design in our materials and components as part of their product development processes. The value of any design in largely depends upon the decision of our customers to manufacture their products or systems in production quantities, the commercial success of the ultimate product and the extent to which the design of our customers\u2019 products or systems could accommodate substitution of competitor products. A consistent failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, achieve design-ins or achieve market acceptance on commercially reasonable terms could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations. Also, the introduction of new products presents particularly significant business challenges in our business because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales.\nOur dependence on sole or limited source suppliers for certain of our raw materials could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and materially increase our costs.\nWe rely on sole and limited source suppliers for certain of the raw materials that are critical to the manufacturing of our products. This reliance subjects us to risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required raw materials, particularly given our use of lean manufacturing and just-in-time inventory techniques, and our reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of raw materials. Our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of these materials in a timely manner or if their cost increased significantly.\nWhile we believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source supplier materials, if necessary, the transition time could be long, particularly if the change requires us to redesign our systems. Ultimately, we may be unable to redesign our systems, which could further increase delays or prevent us from manufacturing our products at all. Even if a system redesign is feasible, increased costs associated with such a redesign would decrease our profit margins, perhaps materially, if we could not effectively pass such costs along to our customers. Further, it would likely result in production and delivery delays, which could lead to lost revenues and damage to our relationships with current and potential customers.\nWe face intense global competition, which could reduce demand for our products or create additional pricing pressure on our products.\nWe operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete with domestic and international companies principally on the basis of the following:\n\u2022\ninnovation;\n\u2022\nhistorical customer relationships;\n\u2022\nproduct quality, reliability, performance and price;\n\u2022\ntechnical and engineering service and support;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product line; and\n\u2022\nmanufacturing capabilities.\nOur competitors include commodity materials suppliers, which offer product substitutions based mostly on price, and suppliers of alternate solutions, which offer product substitutions or eliminations based mostly on disruptive technology. Certain of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have and, in some cases, these competitors are well established in specific product niches. We expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products, which could result in the development of products that offer price or performance features superior to our products. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage for any reason, demand for our products may be materially reduced, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire businesses, dispose of businesses or engage in other transactions for which we may not realize anticipated benefits, or it may take longer than expected to realize such benefits, which may materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we have explored and pursued transaction opportunities that we believe complement our core businesses, and we expect to do so again in the future. We also may consider divesting businesses or assets that we do not regard as part of our core businesses. These transaction opportunities may come in the form of acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, divestitures or other structures. There are risks associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration risk, technology risk, market acceptance risk, litigation risk, environmental risk, regulatory approval risk and risks associated with the failure to complete announced transactions. In the case of acquisitions, we may not be able to discover, during the due diligence process or otherwise, all known and unknown risks associated with the business we are acquiring, including the existence of liabilities. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for known or unknown liabilities arising from the businesses we are divesting. We also may incur significant costs in the pursuit and evaluation of transactions that we do not consummate for a variety of reasons.\nAcquisition and disposition transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we cannot protect our proprietary technology or if we infringe the proprietary rights of others.\nOur proprietary technology supports our ability to compete effectively with other companies, and we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by obtaining domestic and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights and maintaining trade secrets for our manufacturing processes. It is possible, however, that our efforts to obtain such protection in the United States and abroad will be unsuccessful or that the protection afforded will not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.\nEven if domestic and foreign laws do grant initial protection to our technology, our competitors or other third parties may subsequently obtain and unlawfully copy, use or disclose our technologies, products, and processes. We believe that the risk of piracy of our technology is particularly acute in the foreign countries in which we operate. In circumstances in which we conclude that our proprietary technology has been infringed, we may pursue litigation to enforce our rights. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property infringement suits are both costly and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. If we are not successful in protecting our proprietary technology or if the protection afforded to us is not sufficiently broad, our competitors may be able to manufacture and offer products substantially similar to our own, thereby reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. We may also be adversely affected by, and subject to increased competition as a result of, the normal expiration of our issued patents.\nThird parties may also assert infringement claims against us in the future. In addition to the significant costs associated with such suits, as noted above, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and/or require us to license rights from third parties or cease selling our products. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to attract and retain specialized technical and management personnel could impair our expected growth and future success.\nWe depend upon the continued services and performance of key executives, senior management and skilled technical personnel, particularly our sales engineers and other professionals with significant experience in the key industries we serve. Competition for these personnel from other companies, academic institutions and government entities is intense, and our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain these individuals.\nAs a multinational corporation doing business in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liability could negatively impact our operating results.\nAs a result of the variability and uncertainty in global taxation, we are subject to a wide variety of tax-related risks, any of which could provoke changes in our global structure, international operations or intercompany agreements, which could materially reduce our net income in future periods or result in restructuring costs, increased effective tax rates and other expenses. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, including:\n\u2022\ndecisions to redeploy foreign earnings outside of their country of origin for which we have not previously provided for income taxes;\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny of our transactions by taxing authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the geographic mix of our profits among jurisdictions with differing statutory income tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations or issuance of new interpretations of the law applicable to us.\nFor instance, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional estimate of $13.7 million of additional tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and impact of revaluing deferred tax assets at a new lower tax rate. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of U.S. Tax Reform and certain provisions of the new law may also impact our net income in future periods. In addition, many aspects of U.S. Tax Reform may be clarified by new interpretations and guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, the impact of which is uncertain. See Note 13, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d to \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding U.S. Tax Reform.\nAdditionally, our net income in 2016 was impacted by $12.4 million of additional tax expense associated with distributions from China subsidiaries and a change in assertion that earnings would be permanently reinvested. This change resulted in payment of $6.3 million in withholding taxes and accrual of $6.1 million of foreign deferred taxes that became payable upon future distributions subsequent to 2016. For additional information, see \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe terms of our credit agreement require us to satisfy financial ratios and comply with numerous covenants, and our failure to do so could lead to acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nOur credit agreement contains, and any future debt agreements into which we enter may contain, certain financial ratios and certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness or liens, acquire other businesses, dispose of assets, or make investments. Our ability to make scheduled payments on these borrowings and to satisfy financial ratios may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, while the restrictive covenants to which we are subject may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Failure to satisfy these financial ratios or to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement would constitute a default. An uncured default with respect to one or more of our covenants could result in outstanding borrowings thereunder being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to repay other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by litigation stemming from product liability and other claims.\nWe are involved in various unresolved legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of our operations, including asbestos-related product liability claims related to our operations before the 1990s. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 15, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information. We maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, but we cannot be certain that the policy coverage limits will be adequate or that the policies will cover any particular loss. Costs associated with, among other things, the defense of, or settlements or judgments relating to, claims against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of insurance coverage may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Irrespective of insurance coverage, claims against us could divert the attention of our senior management and/or result in reputational damage, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nProjections on the potential exposure and expected insurance coverage are based on a number of assumptions, including the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of such claims, the length of time it takes to dispose of such claims, coverage issues among insurers and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies. To the extent such assumptions are inaccurate, the net liabilities that we have recorded in our financial statements may fail to approximate the losses we could suffer in connection with such claims.\nWe are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals, gases and other substances used in manufacturing our products. Some of these laws in the United States include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, and similar state statutes and regulations. In the European Union we are subject to the EU regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial expenses, including in connection with the acquisition of new equipment. Any failure to comply with present or future environmental laws, rules and regulations could result in fines, suspension of production or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating and/or cleaning up contamination on, or emanating from, properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of the liability involved, or even the entire liability. See Note 15, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners, other third parties and personally identifiable information of our employees. We rely on information technology systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures and user errors. If we experience a disruption in the information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by disgruntled employees or third parties. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our information technology network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. Accordingly, despite our security measures or those of our third party service providers, a security breach may occur, including breaches that we may not be able to detect. Security\nbreaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers, business partners, suppliers or employees, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\nEmployee benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by employee benefit costs, particularly medical, pension and other employee benefits. In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the United States. These factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance, as employee benefit costs continue to escalate. We may not succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees. Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans have risen dramatically in recent years, and are dependent upon a number of factors and assumptions that drive our projected liabilities and annual expenses, such as discount rates, the actual and projected rates of return on the plans\u2019 assets, governmental regulation, global equity prices, portfolio composition, mortality rates and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Changes in assumptions, the ability to grow our pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans\u2019 assets, and other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, could all have a negative impact on our pension plans, which could result in an increase in our pension liabilities, a reduction in the funded status of our plan, increases in annual expense recognized related to the plans, and requirements to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit pension plans, among other factors, all of which could negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nIn October 2017, the Company merged two of the defined benefit pension plans (the Merged Plan). The Company currently intends to terminate the Merged Plan and has requested a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We expect the settlement process to be completed in late 2018 or early 2019, but the process for finalizing the termination of the Merged Plan includes compliance with a regulatory review by the IRS and the timing of the resolution of the compliance process may be delayed. Following receipt of approval from the IRS and upon the effectiveness of the termination of the Merged Plan, we plan to distribute the benefits remaining in the Merged Plan. This distribution could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 35991, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "ROG"}
