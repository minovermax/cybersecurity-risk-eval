RISK FACTORS\nOwnership of our common stock involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe economic environment could pose significant challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom December 2007 through June 2009, the U.S. economy was in recession and economic recovery has been slower than expected. Although the economy continues to slowly improve, declines in real estate values and financial stress on borrowers as a result of an uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s borrowers and their ability to repay their loans to us, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. A weakening of these conditions in the markets in which we operate would likely have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institutions industry. For example, deterioration in economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our ALLL. We may also face the following risks in connection with these events:\nINDEX\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions that negatively affect real estate values and the job market may result, in the deterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration in credit quality could have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us.\n\u2022\nA decrease in deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by commercial or residential real estate.\n\u2022\nA decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities.\n\u2022\nSustained weakness or continuing weakness in our markets may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities.\n\u2022\nThe processes we use to estimate ALLL and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u2022\nWe expect to face increased regulation of its industry, and compliance with such regulation may increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase compliance challenges.\nAs these conditions or similar ones exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various lending and other economic risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere was significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets in 2008 and 2009. The financial markets and the financial services industry in particular suffered unprecedented disruption, causing a number of institutions to fail or require government intervention to avoid failure. These conditions were largely the result of the erosion of the U.S. and global credit markets, including a significant and rapid deterioration in the mortgage lending and related real estate markets. While economic conditions have improved, the sustainability of the economic recovery is uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the economic conditions that adversely affected the financial services industry, and the capital, credit and real estate markets generally, will continue to improve in the near or long term, in which case, we could experience losses and write-downs of assets, and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges. If economic conditions were to deteriorate, particularly within our geographic region, it could result in the following additional consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies may increase causing increases in our provision and allowance for loan losses.\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge-offs.\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans, especially real estate, may continue to decline in value, in turn reducing a client\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans held for investment.\n\u2022\nConsumer confidence levels may decline and cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities and decreased demand for our products and services.\n\u2022\nPerformance of the underlying loans in mortgage backed securities may deteriorate to potentially cause OTTI markdowns to our investment portfolio.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of our allowance for loan losses.\nOur total nonperforming assets amounted to $5.1 million, or 0.18% of our total assets, at December 31, 2015, up from $2.5 million or 0.12% at December 31, 2014. We had $1.3 million of net loan charge-offs for 2015,\nINDEX\nup from $684,000 in 2014. Our provision for loan losses was $6.4 million in 2015, up from $4.7 million in 2014. If increases in our nonperforming assets occur in the future, our net loan charge-offs and/or provision for loan losses may also increase which may have an adverse effect upon our future results of operations.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections, valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and liquid asset verifications. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our ALLL. We create an allowance for estimated loan losses in our accounting records, based on analysis of the following:\n\u2022\nHistorical experience with our loans;\n\u2022\nIndustry historical losses as reported by the FDIC;\n\u2022\nEvaluation of economic conditions;\n\u2022\nRegular reviews of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nRegular reviews of delinquencies;\n\u2022\nThe quality of the collateral underlying our loans; and\n\u2022\nThe effect of external factors, such as competition, legal developments and regulatory requirements.\nAlthough we maintain an ALLL at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio, changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including the sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates, which are beyond our control, may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates. If the actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved, it will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve and the DBO, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our ALLL. Either agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses, based on their judgments, which may be different from those of our management. Any increase in the allowance required by them could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to specific segments of our loan portfolio may result in losses that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral economic conditions and local economic conditions affect our entire loan portfolio. Lending risks vary by the type of loan extended.\nIn our C&I and SBA lending activities, collectability of loans may be adversely affected by risks generally related to small and middle market businesses, such as:\n\u2022\nspecific industry segments, including weakness affecting the business\u2019 customer base;\n\u2022\nChanges in consumer behavior;\n\u2022\nChanges in a business\u2019 personnel;\n\u2022\nIncreases in supplier costs that cannot be passed along to customers;\n\u2022\nIncreases in operating expenses (including energy costs);\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies;\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates, tax rates; and\nIn our investor real estate loans, payment performance and the liquidation values of collateral properties may be adversely affected by risks generally incidental to interests in real property, such as:\n\u2022\nDeclines in real estate values;\n\u2022\nDeclines in rental rates;\nINDEX\n\u2022\nDeclines in occupancy rates;\n\u2022\nIncreases in other operating expenses (including energy costs);\n\u2022\nThe availability of property financing;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including rent control ordinances, environmental legislation and taxation;\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates, real estate and personal property tax rates; and\nIn our HOA and consumer loans, collectability of the loans may be adversely affected by risks generally related to consumers, such as:\n\u2022\nChanges or weakness in employment and wage income;\n\u2022\nChanges in consumer behavior;\n\u2022\nDeclines in real estate values;\n\u2022\nDeclines in rental rates;\n\u2022\nIncreases in association operating expenses (including energy costs);\n\u2022\nThe availability of property financing;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including rent control ordinances, environmental legislation and taxation;\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates, real estate and personal property tax rates; and\nIn our construction loans, collectability and the liquidation values of collateral properties may be adversely affected by risks generally related to consumers (for SFR construction loans) or incidental to interests in real property (for CRE construction loans), such as:\n\u2022\nDeclines in real estate values;\n\u2022\nDeclines in rental rates;\n\u2022\nDeclines in occupancy rates;\n\u2022\nIncreases in other operating expenses (including energy costs);\n\u2022\nThe availability of property financing;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including rent control ordinances, environmental legislation and taxation;\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates, real estate and personal property tax rates; and\nAdverse economic conditions in California may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and reduce the value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nOur business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in California. Difficult economic conditions, including state and local government deficits, in California may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. In addition, demand for our products and services may decline. Declines in the California real estate market could hurt our business, because the vast majority of our loans are secured by real estate located within California. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 54% of our loans secured by real estate were located in California. If real estate values were to decline, especially in California, the collateral for our loans provide less security. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nOur level of credit risk could increase due to our focus on commercial lending and the concentration on small and middle market business customers with heightened vulnerability to economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our commercial real estate loans amounted to $869 million, or 38.4% of our total loan portfolio, and our commercial business loans amounted to $1.14 billion, or 50.3% of our total loan portfolio. At such date, our largest outstanding commercial business loan was $32.1 million, our largest multiple\nINDEX\nborrower relationship was $30.7 million and our largest outstanding commercial real estate loan was $26.5 million. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally are considered riskier than single-family residential loans because they have larger balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends primarily on the successful operation of the businesses or the properties securing the loans. Most of the Company\u2019s commercial business loans are made to small business or middle market customers who may have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made or acquired by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or OREO, which adversely affects our income. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete in our industry.\nWe face direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions, many with a state-wide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, in both originating loans and attracting deposits. Competition in originating loans comes primarily from other banks and finance companies that make loans in our primary market areas. We also face substantial competition in attracting deposits from other banking institutions, money market and mutual funds, credit unions and other investment vehicles. In addition banks with larger capitalizations and non-bank financial institutions that are not governed by bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are better able to serve the needs of larger customers. Many of these financial institutions are also significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we have, and have established customer bases and name recognition. We compete for loans principally on the basis of interest rates and loan fees, the types of loans we offer and the quality of service that we provide to our borrowers. Our ability to attract and retain deposits requires that we provide customers with competitive investment opportunities with respect to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors. To effectively compete, we may have to pay higher rates of interest to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, we rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by our officers, directors and employees and specialized services tailored to meet the individual needs of our customers in order to compete. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nInterest rate fluctuations, which are out of our control, could harm profitability.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income and dividends on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Any change in general market interest rates, whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, may have a significant effect on net interest income. The assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall interest rates or conditions. In general, higher interest rates are associated with a lower volume of loan originations while lower\nINDEX\ninterest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Further, if interest rates decline, our loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and our investments may be prepaid earlier than expected. If that occurs, we may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets, which might also decrease our income. Also, as many of our loans currently have interest rate floors, a rise in rates may increase the cost of our deposits while the rates on the loans remain at their floors, which could decrease our net interest margin. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest margin, asset quality and loan origination volume.\nChanges in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nAt December 31, 2015, $280.3 million of our securities were classified as available-for-sale. At such date, the aggregate net unrealized gain on our available-for-sale securities was $562,000. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the case of equity securities which have no stated maturity, the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 there were OTTI charges or recoveries to report on our securities portfolio. We continue to monitor the fair value of our entire securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future. At December 31, 2015, we had stock holdings in the FHLB of San Francisco totaling $11.4 million, and other stock holdings of $10.9 million which included stock from FRB, a CRA investment, and TIB. The stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our stock holdings. There can be no assurance that future negative changes to the financial condition of the issuers may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings.\nConditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, as we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a reduction in our credit ratings, if any, an increase in costs of capital in financial capital markets, negative operating results, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn, a decrease in depositor or investor confidence or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative\nINDEX\nexposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. There are currently proposed laws, rules and regulations that, if adopted, would impact our operations. These proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, may be adopted in the future, which could (1) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (2) restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (3) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (4) otherwise adversely affect our business or prospects for business.\nMoreover, banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act continues to materially affect our operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or are anticipated to affect our operations include:\n\u2022\nChanges to regulatory capital requirements and how we plan capital and liquidity levels;\n\u2022\nCreation of new government regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, which possesses broad rule-making and enforcement authorities;\n\u2022\nRestrictions that will impact the nature of our incentive compensation programs for executive officers;\n\u2022\nChanges in insured depository institution regulations and assessments;\n\u2022\nMortgage loan origination and risk retention; and\n\u2022\nPotential new and different litigation and regulatory enforcement risks.\nWhile several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment and others have come into effect over the last few years, many provisions still require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented. Some of these regulations have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies but not yet finalized. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nINDEX\nChanges in laws, government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of substantial legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the cost and burden of compliance with applicable laws and regulations have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented by the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers, and therefore on our results of operations.\nWe expect to face continued increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the past financial crisis. The effects on us of recently enacted and proposed legislation and regulatory programs cannot reliably be determined at this time.\nThe repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, financial institutions can offer interest on demand deposits to compete for clients. Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if the Bank begins offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the DBO and the FDIC, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nWe may in the future engage in additional FDIC-assisted transactions, which could present additional risk to our business.\nWe completed acquisitions of assets and assumption of deposits and liabilities of CNB on February 11, 2011 and of PDNB on April 27, 2012 from the FDIC. We acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of CNB and PDNB without entering into a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. In the current economic environment, and subject to any requisite regulatory consent, we may potentially be presented with additional opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of other failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. The CNB acquisition, the PDNB acquisition and any future acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing\nINDEX\nindemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. However, because FDIC-assisted transactions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for and evaluating an acquisition, including preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks if we engage in FDIC-assisted transactions. The risks related to the CNB acquisition, the PDNB acquisition and other future FDIC-assisted transactions include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the CNB acquisition, the PDNB acquisition or other future FDIC-assisted transactions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability.\nMoreover, even if we were inclined to participate in additional FDIC-assisted transactions, there are no assurances that the FDIC would allow us to participate or what the terms of such transaction might be or whether we would be successful in acquiring the bank or assets that we are seeking. We may be required to raise additional capital as a condition to, or as a result of, participation in FDIC-assisted transactions. Any such transactions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.\nFurthermore, to the extent we are allowed to, and choose to, participate in additional FDIC-assisted transactions, we may face competition from other financial institutions with respect to the proposed FDIC-assisted transactions. To the extent that our competitors are selected to participate in FDIC-assisted transactions, our ability to identify and attract acquisition candidates and/or make acquisitions on favorable terms may be adversely affected.\nOur HOA business is substantially dependent upon its relationship with Associa, which is the entity that owns and controls the HOA management companies that manage the HOAs from which we receive a majority of our HOA deposits.\nOn March 15, 2013, we acquired FAB, which is exclusively focused on providing deposit and other services to HOAs and HOA management companies nationwide. A majority of our HOA customers are also customers of the HOA management companies controlled by Associations, Inc. (\u201cAssocia\u201d). At December 31, 2015, approximately 60% of the HOA transaction deposits we held were derived from our relationship with Associa. We will continue to rely on the relationship with Associa to solicit HOA deposits as deemed necessary. If Associa or its HOA management companies lose some or all of their HOA customers, fall into financial or legal difficulty or elect to reduce the amount of HOA customers that it directs to us, it could have a material and adverse effect upon our business, including the decline or total loss of all of the deposits from the HOA management companies and the HOAs. We cannot assure you that we would be able to replace the relationship with Associa and its HOA management companies if any of these events occurred, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the closing of the FAB acquisition, we appointed John Carona to the boards of directors of the Company and the Bank. Mr. Carona is the founder, chief executive officer and a director of Associa.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions on an ongoing basis. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our stock\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nINDEX\nWe may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. We do not currently have any specific plans, arrangements or understandings regarding such expansion. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate, or if consummated, successfully integrate future acquisitions or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions. In attempting to make such future acquisitions, we anticipate competing with other financial institutions, many of which have greater financial and operational resources. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nPotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\nExposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022\nDifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022\nPotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\nPotential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nThe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and\n\u2022\nPotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental liabilities with respect to properties on which we take title may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nWe could be subject to environmental liabilities on real estate properties we foreclose and take title in the normal course of our business. In connection with environmental contamination, we may be held liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances at a property. The investigation or remediation costs associated with such activities could be substantial. Furthermore, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination even if we were the former owner of a contaminated site. The incurrence of a significant environmental liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConfidential customer information transmitted through the Bank\u2019s online banking service is vulnerable to security breaches and computer viruses, which could expose the Bank to litigation and adversely affect its reputation and ability to generate deposits.\nThe Bank provides its customers the ability to bank online. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking. The Bank\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems. The Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the Bank\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Bank to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and ability to generate deposits.\nINDEX\nWe are dependent on our key personnel.\nOur future operating results depend in large part on the continued services of our key personnel, including Steven R. Gardner, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who developed and implemented our business strategy. The loss of Mr. Gardner could have a negative impact on the success of our business strategy. In addition, we rely upon the services of Eddie Wilcox, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer, and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any employee other than Mr. Gardner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. The unexpected loss of services of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, recent regulatory proposals and guidance relating to compensation may negatively impact our ability to retain and attract skilled personnel.\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, could harm our business.\nWe are based in Irvine, California, and approximately 54% of our loans secured by real estate were located in California at December 31, 2015. In addition, the computer systems that operate our Internet websites and some of their back-up systems are located in Irvine and San Diego, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan portfolio, which is comprised substantially of real estate loans. Uninsured or underinsured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. California has also experienced energy shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate in those areas affected. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of common stock at times or at prices you find attractive.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for holders of our common stock to resell their common stock when desired and at desirable prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\u2022\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\nINDEX\n\u2022\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nChanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nA limited trading market has historically existed for our common stock, which could lead to significant price volatility.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol \u201cPPBI,\u201d but there has historically been a relatively low trading volume in our common stock. Although we recently issued additional shares of our common stock in our acquisition of Security California Bancorp that closed in January 2016, we may continue to experience a limited trading market for our common stock, which may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. In addition, even if a more active market in our common stock develops, we cannot assure you that such a market will continue.\nWe have retained earnings, if any, to provide funds for use in our business.\nIt is our policy to retain earnings, if any, to provide funds for use in our business. We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. In addition, in order to pay cash dividends over time to our stockholders, we would most likely need to obtain funds from the Bank. The Bank\u2019s ability, in turn, to pay dividends to us is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of (1) a bank\u2019s retained earnings; or (2) a bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DBO, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that banking regulators determine that the stockholders\u2019 equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution.\nApproval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve Board System, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without regulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized.", "PERMNO": 85020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PPBI"}
