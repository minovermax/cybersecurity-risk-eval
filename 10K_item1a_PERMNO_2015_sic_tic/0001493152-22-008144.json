{"cik": "891417", "company": "Nano Magic Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 has disrupted the global economy and Nano Magic\u2019s supply chain and the long-term effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and government orders imposed restrictions and disrupted the U.S. and global economies. The duration of the disruption and the short and long-term effects of new and changing requirements and new consumer and business behaviors are impossible to predict.\nNano Magic experienced increased demand for its anti-fog product as a result of the pandemic. It is unknown whether demand will remain high once the effects of the pandemic are blunted by the availability of new vaccines. Similarly, the staying power of new entrants who took advantage of the demand is unknown.\nThe long-term effect of the pandemic on the supply chain, raw materials supply and pricing, the distribution of Nano Magic products, and changes in consumer behavior as a result of the pandemic experience cannot be foreseen.\nSupply chain disruption and sales growth can put additional strain on our need for working capital.\nDisruption in the supply chain from COVID-19 has caused us to see some higher prices and longer lead times. To assure supply, Nano Magic must order materials with longer lead times, increasing the time between its down payments to vendors and the time when Nano Magic can realize a sale. Increased order volume and increased sales require that Nano Magic buy larger quantities of raw material inventory and packaging materials. Sales growth also increases its need for working capital, as Nano Magic must pay for the materials before it can see the increased revenue from customers. Similarly, labor must be paid for before the revenue is realized. This can create a greater need for growth capital when funds are already curtailed by Nano Magic\u2019s operating losses.\nNano Magic has limited resources which can hamper its ability to execute its business plan.\nNano Magic is a small company with limited human and financial resources. This limits the resources Nano Magic can devote to the sale and promotion of its products, and may limit its ability to tackle issues that arise in manufacturing and distribution. Nano Magic\u2019s size curtails the resources Nano Magic can devote to promoting its existing products and developing brand recognition. Nano Magic\u2019s limited resources can constrain its ability to take advantage of opportunities, may limit its growth and may give competitors time to challenge its products in the marketplace. These factors will make it harder for Nano Magic to be successful.\nNano Magic is dependent on key executives and loss of its President and CEO or other key personnel could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nNano Magic\u2019s President and CEO, Tom Berman, is under contract through the end of 2023. His vision and leadership are very important to the execution of the Nano Magic business plan, and loss of his services would adversely affect Nano Magic\u2019s results of operations and the value of its stock. Other executives and employees are at-will employees, so they may terminate their employment relationship at any time. Loss of experienced personnel and their knowledge of Nano Magic\u2019s business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Moreover, because of Nano Magic\u2019s small size, it would be very difficult for remaining personnel to perform the duties fulfilled by the loss of personnel.\nIncreased sales under the Nano Magic brand name and building a strong brand with consumer brand loyalty will take time.\nNano Magic has placed a number of Nano Magic branded products in pharmacies and big box retailers. Developing customer loyalty and brand awareness takes time. The time frame could be shortened if Nano Magic had greater resources for marketing and advertising.\nConsumer confidence and spending habits have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but what that means and how this will affect sales of Nano Magic products remains unknown.\nNano Magic is a small company and the marketplace for consumer cleaning products is competitive.\nNano Magic has a limited line of products; retail chains and big-box stores may only want suppliers that offer a more extensive product line. Nano Magic has fewer resources than many of its competitors to devote to extending product lines, and to new products and packaging. Its inability to devote the required resources to adapt to the demands of consumers or to meet competitive product offerings may limit Nano Magic\u2019s ability to execute on its business plan and hurt its revenue.\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach, data loss or other compromise, including if unauthorized access to our data, our business operations may be interrupted, our reputation and business relationships may be harmed, and we may incur other costs.\nWe use cloud-based computer systems for our communications (e-mail, voice, data exchange, etc.), for other aspects of our operations and for our business and financial records. Any security breach, data loss, or other compromise, including those resulting from a cybersecurity attack, phishing attack, or any unauthorized access, unauthorized usage, virus or similar breach or disruption could result in the loss or destruction of or unauthorized access to, or use, alteration, disclosure, or acquisition of, data, business disruptions and delays as well as damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations, or other liabilities. Our website and technology infrastructure also may experience performance issues due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, hosting disruptions, capacity constraints, technical failures, natural disasters, or fraud.\nWe also rely on cloud technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services, relationship management services, and aspects of our manufacturing and sales functions. If our service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of services or features that we utilize, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to our providers\u2019 facilities, we could experience business interruptions as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our cloud-based offerings for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our vendors and service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and fraud. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur facilities, as well as the facilities of third-parties that provide or maintain, or have access to our data or network infrastructure, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cyber security attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. In the event that our or any third-party provider\u2019s systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate may be impaired. A third party\u2019s decision to close facilities or terminate services without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could adversely impact our operations. If business continuity and disaster recovery plans of ours or of a third-party provider prove to be inadequate in preventing the loss of data or service interruptions, this could cause further disruptions to our operations or damages to important systems or facilities or damage to our computer hardware or systems or those of our employees, or customers. Our systems have been the target of cyber-attacks. Although we have taken and continue to take steps to enhance our cybersecurity posture, we cannot assure that future cyber incidents will not occur or that our systems will not be targeted or breached in the future.\nDrug stores and big-box retail chains that Nano Magic has targeted as a distribution channel to increase its sales volume have their own specific product requirements and demand a high level of support from vendors which will be challenging for Nano Magic, due to its size and limited resources.\nTo supply a large number of stores and maintain their brand quality, drug stores and big-box retail chains often require, among other things, that their vendors comply with scheduling and packaging requirements, maintain back-up inventory in reserves and impose other standards and restrictions on their vendors. If Nano Magic, because of its limited resources, cannot meet these requirements, then it will not be able to service these distribution channels, and Nano Magic\u2019s potential for revenue growth will be harmed. Moreover, losing a customer may leave Nano Magic with significant obsolete inventory.\nSales of specialized coatings to industrial customers that incorporate Nano Magic products into their own product offerings make us dependent on Nano Magic\u2019s industrial customers\u2019 commitment to the product and dependent on the success of Nano Magic\u2019s customers.\nSome of Nano Magic\u2019s existing products are sold to institutional customers that incorporate Nano Magic\u2019s product into their own product or service offering to their customers. This means the success of Nano Magic\u2019s product is dependent on the level of support, marketing and customer assistance provided by the institutional customers. Also, Nano Magic cannot control timing, marketing or introduction of its products or improved products, the timing or methods used to address customer concerns, and Nano Magic cannot affect directly marketing or distribution of the products or services that incorporate its products. If Nano Magic\u2019s industrial customer has other priorities or is unsuccessful in its marketing or provides poor customer service, then the sales of Nano Magic\u2019s products and Nano Magic\u2019s results of operations will be adversely affected. To the extent that Nano Magic\u2019s customers feel the effects of an economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic, that may lessen their interest in introducing products or services incorporating Nano Magic products.\nRevenue in the contract research segment is dependent on government funding for technology development that is subject to a number of risks that could adversely impact Nano Magic.\nResearch contracts funded by the U.S. government are awarded through multiple agencies. Agency priorities and focus can change over time, and government funding overall is affected by political considerations affecting priorities and budgets. Government funding and priorities will also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of Nano Magic\u2019s projects originate with the SBIR program. The initial grant is small, but if Nano Magic establishes proof of concept, then it will be eligible for larger, follow-on grants. However, eligibility for such additional grants also require approval and grant award funding. If funding priorities change, then new grants may not be made in areas that are a focus for Nano Magic\u2019s research, and Nano Magic may need to refocus its funding proposals or apply to different agencies. Moreover, some parts of most projects are the responsibility of subcontractors, and a failure of performance by a subcontractor may adversely affect performance under the contract and may affect follow-on funding or Nano Magic\u2019s reputation as a government contractor or subcontractor. Failure to receive awards of new research funding will adversely affect revenue and margin in Nano Magic\u2019s Contract research segment.\nRisks relating to the Introduction of New Products\nOther cleaning product companies are much larger, with more money for advertising and marketing and staff dedicated to regulatory regimes related to selling disinfectants into the consumer market.\nNano Magic is working to accomplish a commercial launch of a new cleaning product based on its patented technology. Other Nano Magic products have not been subject to regulations administered by the EPA. Compliance with EPA requirements may involve significant product testing and qualification - and take time and money - and new and changed regulations require monitoring on an ongoing basis. In addition, other government regulations apply to consumer sales. Nano Magic does not presently have staff responsible for regulatory approvals and compliance and will need to build that capacity or hire outside consultants. How this will impact time to commercial launch and the cost of compliance, both to accomplish launch and on an ongoing basis, are unknown.\nSales to new industrial or institutional customers typically have a long-lead time, as much as two years between customer interest and the first commercial sale, which makes it difficult to capitalize on opportunities and limits Nano Magic\u2019s ability to grow revenue.\nTo become a supplier to a new institutional customer Nano Magic must complete the customer\u2019s internal approval process and be set up as a new vendor. This process is outside of Nano Magic\u2019s control and puts a strain on its limited resources. When the product is a coating product, Nano Magic\u2019s technology may need to be incorporated into the customer\u2019s manufacturing or the production processes of its customers. This can require an initial small-scale pilot project before the process with Nano Magic\u2019s coating or technology is expanded to full-scale commercial production. If that occurs, even if no problems are encountered, then commercial sales will be delayed, and Nano Magic must allocate the technical resources to support the customer as it scales-up production. The time and resources required make the effort more risky for Nano Magic, as the customer could stop the project at any point. The process also requires a significant commitment from the customer, and recognizing the limits of Nano Magic\u2019s resources, potential customers may choose not to work with a small supplier.\nNano Magic has limited resources which could hamper its ability to launch new products.\nNano Magic\u2019s small size and limited resources reduce the number of potential new product ideas that Nano Magic can pursue and the number of potential products that Nano Magic works on at any time. These constraints can also limit Nano Magic\u2019s ability to bring new product ideas through development stage and commercial-scale manufacturing. Its limited resources can inhibit Nano Magic\u2019s ability to take advantage of opportunities, and may give competitors time to challenge its products in the marketplace. These factors may hinder Nano Magic\u2019s ability to expand its product line and grow its revenue.\nSome of Nano Magic\u2019s technology development is in its early stages and the viability of commercial products is unknown.\nSome applications of Nano Magic\u2019s intellectual property, and certain products that use these technologies, will require significant additional development, engineering, testing and investment prior to commercialization. Unknowns include: whether commercially viable products can be developed; the size of the potential customer base; the resources required to develop, test, standardize, manufacture, market, distribute and sell these potential products. Evaluating the potential of a product under development is a matter of judgment, and errors in judgment relating to products Nano Magic is developing would reduce the resources available for other potential products and delay commercialization which would adversely affect Nano Magic\u2019s results of operations and may require Nano Magic to seek additional capital that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nRisks Relating to Nano Magic\u2019s Technology and Commercialization\nNano Magic\u2019s strategy to commercialize new products from its intellectual property may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, any of which could adversely affect Nano Magic\u2019s results and negatively affect the value of its common stock.\nThough few companies have successfully developed commercial products based on nanotechnology, Nano Magic plans to create new products using its intellectual property. To implement this plan, Nano Magic must identify product opportunities, take the products from concept to prototype, and make and sell the new product commercially. Many factors affect a customer\u2019s acceptance of new products and many new product ideas are never realized. Many others never achieve commercial success. If Nano Magic cannot successfully develop and sell products enhanced by nanotechnology, or if the process drags on, then the value of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock may continue to be adversely affected.\nNano Magic\u2019s products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may subject it to claims, or prevent or delay its product development efforts and stop it from selling or increase the costs of its products.\nNano Magic\u2019s commercial success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. If claims are made that Nano Magic is using third party technology without authorization or that any third-party patents cover Nano Magic\u2019s products or their use, then the holders of any of these patents or other intellectual property may be able to block the sale of Nano Magic\u2019s products unless Nano Magic obtains a license or changes the products so as not to use the third-party\u2019s intellectual property. Nano Magic could incur significant costs defending against any claim; and, if Nano Magic is liable, then Nano Magic may not be able to enter licensing arrangements or to redesign the products at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.\nNano Magic may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nNano Magic relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary know-how and technology, especially where Nano Magic does not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Others independently may develop the same or similar technology, or otherwise obtain access to Nano Magic\u2019s proprietary technology. Nano Magic relies in part on confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of Nano Magic\u2019s proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use Nano Magic\u2019s proprietary information and to develop products that better compete with its products.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights necessary to defend Nano Magic or enforce its rights will be costly and time consuming.\nNano Magic\u2019s ability to defend its intellectual property may require litigation to enforce its rights or to defend litigation brought by a third-party. Any of these lawsuits, regardless of their success, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and may require delay or suspension of commercial sales while they are pending. The cost could cause Nano Magic to forego litigation or to settle on terms that are disadvantageous. If litigation is undertaken or defended, that attendant cost or delay could have a material, adverse impact on Nano Magic\u2019s results of operations.\nSome health effects of nanotechnology are unknown.\nThere has been scientific debate on the health effects of nanomaterials. The science of nanotechnology is engineering at the molecular level to modify or build materials. Many nano-materials are found in nature; others are not naturally occurring. Some scientists believe that certain nanomaterials may be hazardous to human health or the environment. The health effect of new materials is unknown, and can be affected by how they are incorporated and bonded to other materials. Nano Magic focuses on materials larger than 100 nanometers so that they are not regulated as nanoparticles, and Nano Magic carefully evaluates potential health effects of its products on its customers and the effects of handling materials on Nano Magic\u2019s employees. Nano Magic is very mindful of the risks of materials Nano Magic uses and focuses on health and safety. However, debate about the health effects of nanoparticles and nanotechnology may adversely affect market acceptance of Nano Magic\u2019s products and adversely affect its financial performance.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Nano Magic\u2019s Common Stock\nNano Magic common stock has not resumed trading on the OCTQB since the SEC issued an order suspending trading for a period of 10 days. Very few companies resume trading following a trading suspension, and failure of Nano Magic stock to resume trading will likely depress Nano Magic\u2019s stock price and will also make it more difficult to sell Nano Magic stock.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Commission issued an Order of Suspension of Trading (the \u201cOrder\u201d) with respect to Nano Magic\u2019s Common Stock. The trading suspension associated with the Order expired after ten (10) business days, at 11:59 PM on Thursday, May 14, 2020. Nano Magic has not resumed trading on the OTCQB since entry of the trading suspension and the resumption of trading eligibility. One effect of the Order is Nano Magic lost eligibility for the \u201cpiggyback exception\u201d under Rule 15c2-11(f)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Even if the Commission were to rule in favor of Nano Magic and restore the \u201cpiggyback exception,\u201d then there still is no assurance that a broker-dealer will resume publishing quotations for Nano Magic.\nConcentration of stock ownership with affiliates could make a management change or an acquisition of Nano Magic more difficult.\nApproximately 84% of the outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by Nano Magic\u2019s present officers and directors. Certain provisions of Nano Magic\u2019s organizational documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock. For example, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws will:\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by Nano Magic\u2019s board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of its common stock;\n\u25cf limit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf permit written action by voting stockholders, permitting affiliates acting alone to accomplish most stockholder actions;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements to nominate persons for election to Nano Magic\u2019s board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u25cf provide for the filling of vacancies on Nano Magic\u2019s Board of Directors by action of a majority of the directors and not by the stockholders.\nThese provisions could also limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of Nano Magic common stock.\nNano Magic\u2019s common stock is thinly traded, and the number of free trading shares is small, thereby contributing to price volatility.\nEven before the trading suspension (described above), there was little trading of Nano Magic common stock. At present, Nano Magic stock trades in the grey market. As a result, an investor may not be able to sell Nano Magic common stock at the time that the investor would like to sell. Furthermore, if a stock is thinly traded, then any sale may depress the market price.\nThe limited number of Nano Magic\u2019s free trading shares may limit its ability to raise capital through private placements forcing Nano Magic to offer its stock using more costly qualification or registration procedures.\nTo remain eligible for the OTCQB, Nano Magic must have a minimum float of 10% of the outstanding stock. Shares sold in a private placement are restricted, and issuing too many restricted shares will take Nano Magic below the float required to remain on the OTCQB. This may force Nano Magic to use available qualification and registration procedures for any capital raise. This in turn would require additional time and resources before Nano Magic would have additional funds for operations or other purposes.\nThe market price of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock is subject to potential significant price fluctuation because the common stock is thinly traded, and that could result in substantial losses for investors and subject Nano Magic to securities class action litigation.\nAmong the factors that may cause the market price of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u25cf The trading volume of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock;\n\u25cf Changes in Nano Magic\u2019s capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf Actual or expected sales of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock by its stockholders;\n\u25cf Failure of Nano Magic\u2019s products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;\n\u25cf Changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of Nano Magic\u2019s markets;\n\u25cf Fluctuation in Nano Magic\u2019s quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf Recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf The commencement or outcome of litigation involving Nano Magic, its industry segments, or some combination; and\n\u25cf Changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices, or actions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the OTCQB and the market for nanotechnology companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in Nano Magic common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of Nano Magic\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock and expose Nano Magic to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm Nano Magic\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNano Magic does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nNano Magic intends to retain earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of its business, and Nano Magic does not anticipate paying cash dividends. Stockholders can expect to receive a return on common stock only if the market price of the stock increases.\nFuture sales of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock may depress its share price.\nSales of substantial number of shares of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock in the public market following a capital raise, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of Nano Magic\u2019s common stock to decline.\nNano Magic\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules, and it may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nNano Magic\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless Nano Magic maintains a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in Nano Magic\u2019s securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of Nano Magic\u2019s securities. These requirements may also affect your ability to resell Nano Magic\u2019s common stock.\nNano Magic has reported material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, and if not remedied, at some point Nano Magic may determine that these internal controls may not be effective.\nIn order to remedy the identified deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, Nano Magic may be required to add additional staff. Nano Magic may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses, or to complete its evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the annual evaluation process, if Nano Magic identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, then Nano Magic may be unable to assert that its internal controls are effective. If Nano Magic is unable to assert that its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors then could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, which could harm Nano Magic\u2019s stock price.\nNano Magic\u2019s obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, and carry significant cost.\nAs a public company, Nano Magic has legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that burden its profit As a reporting company under the Exchange Act, Nano Magic is required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to its business and financial condition, and proxy and other information statements, and is subject to the rules and regulations implemented by the Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and accounting pronouncements and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.\nMoreover, Nano Magic must monitor changes and comply with any changes to these rules and regulations, and with any future changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. Changes can create uncertainty for public companies, increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. Laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases, due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Nano Magic\u2019s need to comply with existing and evolving regulatory requirements imposes administrative expense and also diverts management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78911, "SIC": 2842, "TIC": "NMGX"}
