{"cik": "1122063", "company": "FTE Networks, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision, and you should only consider an investment in our common stock if you can afford to sustain the loss of your entire investment. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nCorporate Risks\nThe Company may not be able to maintain sufficient liquidity.\nIn the year ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $3,554,914 and we used $64,392 of cash in operating activities. As of September 30, 2015, we have a working capital deficiency of $6.4 million, which includes $1.8 million of unpaid payroll tax liabilities associated with our staffing segment, plus related penalties and interest. If we don\u2019t satisfy the payroll tax obligation as planned, it is possible that we could be subject to additional fines and penalties. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, we closed on an $8 million credit facility, of which (a) $1.8 million was used to extinguish $3.5 million of senior secured notes and $1.8 million of related accrued interest; and (b) $3.0 million was deposited into a restricted Company bank account which requires the credit provider\u2019s approval to utilize. The Company will need to continue to monitor its liquidity and many need to raise additional funds until it begins to generate cash from operating activities.\nWe depend upon key personnel and need additional personnel.\nOur success depends on the continuing services of the executive team. Additionally, the success of our operations will largely depend upon our ability to successfully attract and maintain competent and qualified key management personnel. As with any company with limited resources, there can be no guaranty that we will be able to attract such individuals or that the presence of such individuals will necessarily translate into profitability for us. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nFTE\u2019s operation as a public company subjects it to extensive corporate governance and disclosure regulations that may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, FTE incurs significant legal and accounting expenses associated with its public company reporting requirements. In addition, like many smaller public companies, FTE faces a significant impact from required compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires management of public companies to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The SEC has adopted rules implementing Section 404 for public companies as well as disclosure requirements. Any failure to implement effective or improved internal controls, or to resolve difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm FTE\u2019s operating results, or cause a failure to meet reporting obligations or result in management assessing internal control over financial reporting as not effective. Further, we have, in the past, failed to comply with our reporting obligations, which resulted in the revocation of the registration of our Securities (see \u201cThe Registration and Trading of Our Securities,\u201d beginning on page 5 above). Now that our common stock is registered again, we are again subject to the reporting requirements of Regulation 13(a) of the Exchange Act. Any failure to implement effective internal controls, or to meet our reporting obligations could cause investors to lose confidence in FTE\u2019s reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nRisks Associated with the Telecommunications Industry\nWe possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and if we are unable to collect account receivables in a timely manner or at all, our cash flow and profitability will be negative impacted, which such risk is heightened during unstable economic periods\nWe extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work. These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators and others. We had net accounts receivable of approximately $1.2 million at September 30, 2015 and $1.9 million at September 30, 2014. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Further bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all, reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our liquidity and profitability. Additionally, we could incur losses in excess of current bad debt allowances. The Company recognized approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million in bad debt expense in the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe must effectively manage the growth of our operations and effectively integrate acquisitions, or our company will suffer.\nTo manage our growth and effectively integrate acquisitions, we believe we must continue to implement and improve our operations. We may not have adequately evaluated the costs and risks associated with this expansion, and our systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully offer our products and services and implement our business plan on a profitable basis. The success of our future operating activities will also depend upon our ability to expand our support system to meet the demands of our growing business. Any failure by our management to effectively anticipate, implement, and manage changes required to sustain our growth would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated. As of September 30, 2015, Customer E and Customer B represented 47% and 12% of accounts receivable, respectively. As of September 30, 2014, Customer A, Customer B and Customer C represented 41%, 18% and 13% of accounts receivable, respectively.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, Customer D represented approximately 37% of revenues and Customer C represented approximately 36% of revenues. For the year ended September 30, 2014, Customer F represented approximately 72% of revenues.\nOur revenue may significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing and volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications and staffing industries have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. The consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies by the surviving entity. Reduced demand for our services or a change in procurement strategy of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThere is competition for those private companies suitable for a merger transaction of the type contemplated by management.\nWe are in a highly competitive market for a small number of telecommunications business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of implementing our acquisition strategy. We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking acquisitions in the telecommunications space. A large number of established and well financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of implementing our business strategy.\nFailure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired.\nService level agreements in our customer agreements could subject us to liability or the loss of revenue.\nOur contracts with customers typically contain service guarantees and service delivery date targets, which if not met by us, enable customers to claim credits against their payments to us and, under certain conditions, terminate their agreements. Our inability to meet our service level guarantees could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow. While we typically have carve-outs for force majeure events, many events, such as fiber cuts, equipment failure and third-party vendors being unable to meet their underlying commitments or service level agreements with us, could impact our ability to meet our service level agreements and are potentially out of our control.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction and/or cancellation.\nOur backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long-term requirements contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally our experience in procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Our estimates of a customer\u2019s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate, particularly in light of the current economic conditions and the uncertainty that imposes on changes in our customer\u2019s requirements for our services. If our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits, this could adversely affect our future growth and the price of our common stock.\nLegislative actions and initiatives relating to telecommunications may not result in an increase in demand for our services.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d) originally allocated $7.2 billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without high-speed infrastructure. However, we cannot predict the actual benefits to us from the implementation of ARRA programs. For example, significant additional contracts resulting from investments for rural broadband deployment under the ARRA may not be awarded to us.\nIf we do not adapt to swift changes in the telecommunications industry, we could lose customers or market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new service introductions, shifting distribution channels and changing customer demands. We may not be able to adequately adapt our services or acquire new services that can compete successfully. Our failure to obtain and integrate new technologies and applications could impact the breadth of our service portfolio resulting in service gaps, a less differentiated service suite and a less compelling offering to customers. We risk losing customers to our competitors if we are unable to adapt to this rapidly evolving marketplace.\nIn addition, the introduction of new services or technologies, as the well as the further development of existing services and technologies, may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those that we provide. As a result, our most significant competitors in the future may be new entrants to the telecommunications industry. These new entrants may not be burdened by an installed base of outdated equipment or obsolete technology. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt in a timely manner to technological changes. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues, harm our business reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. The services we provide are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 human error;\n\u2022 power loss;\n\u2022 physical or electronic security breaches;\n\u2022 fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, and other natural disasters;\n\u2022 water damage;\n\u2022 the effect of war, terrorism, and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and\n\u2022 sabotage and vandalism.\nProblems within our network, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. In the past, we have at times experienced instability in our equipment attributed to equipment failure and power outages. Although such disruptions have been remedied and the network has been stabilized, there can be no assurance that similar disruptions will not occur in the future. We have service level commitment obligations with substantially all of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or equipment damage could result in credits for service interruptions to these customers. We have at times in the past given credits to our customers as a result of service interruptions due to equipment failures. We cannot assume that our customers will accept these credits as compensation in the future. Also, service interruptions and equipment failures may expose us to additional legal liability.\nWe are subject to significant regulation that could change or otherwise impact us in an adverse manner.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including:\n- licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;\n- regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;\n- permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;\n- wage and hour regulations;\n- regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements; and\n- building and electrical codes.\nWe believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.\nRisks Associated with the Staffing Industry\nOur staffing business is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions.\nThe demand for our staffing services is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon staffing needs of our customers. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the United States or in the economic condition of any region or telecommunications industry in which we have a significant presence may severely reduce the demand for our services and thereby significantly decrease our revenues and profits.\nOur staffing business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could materially harm our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation. The cost to comply, and any inability to comply, with government regulation could materially harm our business. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially harm our business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Laws\u201d) include various health-related provisions to take effect through 2014, including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, beginning in 2014 penalties will be assessed on certain employers who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Unless modified by regulations or subsequent legislation, providing such additional health insurance benefits to our temporary workers, or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided, would increase our costs. If we are unable to raise the rates that we charge our customers to cover these costs, such increases in costs could materially harm our business.\nWe may incur employment related and other claims that could materially harm our business.\nWe employ individuals on a temporary basis and places them in our customers' workplaces. We have minimal control over our customers' workplace environments. As the employer of record of these temporary workers, we incur a risk of liability for various workplace events, including claims for personal injury, wage and hour requirements, discrimination or harassment, and other actions or inactions of our temporary workers. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation including class action litigation. Although we currently believe resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nWe cannot be certain that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our business. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nWe are dependent on workers' compensation insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms.\nWe provides workers' compensation insurance for our temporary workers. Our workers' compensation insurance policies are renewed annually. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The loss of our workers' compensation insurance coverage would prevent us from doing business in the majority of our markets. Further, we cannot be certain that our current and former insurance carriers will be able to pay claims that we make under such policies. These additional sources of capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain customers or market share\nThe staffing services business is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. There are new competitors entering the market which may increase pricing pressures. In addition, long-term contracts form only a small portion of our revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain customers or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that we will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain our current profit margins.\nOur results of operations could materially deteriorate if we fail to attract, develop and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees who are able to meet the needs of our customers. We believe our competitive advantage is providing unique solutions for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including management, sales, recruiting, service and administrative personnel. The turnover rate in the staffing industry is high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals may delay or affect the speed of our planned growth or strategy change. Delayed expansion, significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with our Securities\nA significant number of additional shares of our common stock may be issued upon the exercise or conversion of existing securities, which issuances would substantially dilute existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we had outstanding shares of Series A, Series A-1, and Series D preferred stock convertible into an aggregate of 733,364,414 shares of common stock, outstanding warrants for the purchase of securities equivalent to 40,141,799 shares of common stock, and a note payable convertible into 200,000 shares of common stock. The Series D shares are automatically convertible at a rate of 400 shares of common stock on a pre-reverse-split basis (the equivalent of 20 shares of common stock after the effect of the 1-for-20 reverse stock split) for each preferred stock only upon (a) a sufficient increase in the authorized common shares and (b) the implementation of a 1-for-20 reverse split of the common shares. The issuance of these shares of common stock will substantially dilute the proportionate ownership and voting power of existing stockholders, and their issuance, or the possibility of their issuance, may depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe pay no dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends in the past, and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThere is, at present, only a limited market for our common stock and there is no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace from time to time, the market for our common stock is extremely limited. In addition, although there have been market makers in our securities, we cannot assure that these market makers will continue to make a market in our securities or that other factors outside of our control will not cause them to stop market making in our securities. Making a market in securities involves maintaining bid and ask quotations and being able to effect transactions in reasonable quantities at those quoted prices, subject to various securities laws and other regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the development and maintenance of a public trading market depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control or that of any market maker. Market makers are not required to maintain a continuous two-sided market, are required to honor firm quotations for only a limited number of shares, and are free to withdraw firm quotations at any time. Even with a market maker, factors such as our past losses from operations and the small size of our company mean that there can be no assurance of an active and liquid market for our securities developing in the foreseeable future. Even if a market develops, we cannot assure that a market will continue, or that shareholders will be able to resell their securities at any price.\nSince our common stock is classified as \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the restrictions of the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations may result in less liquidity for our common stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations which define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as therein defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transactions involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock by a retail customer, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about commissions payable to both the broker/dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because the market price for shares of our common stock is less than $5.00, and we do not satisfy any of the exceptions to the SEC\u2019s definition of penny stock, our common stock is classified as a penny stock. As a result of the penny stock restrictions, brokers or potential investors may be reluctant to trade in our securities, which may result in less liquidity for our common stock.\nShareholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144.\nPursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cRule 144\u201d), a \u201cshell company\u201d is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets, assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. We previously were a \u201cshell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144, and, as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 cannot be made unless, among other things, we continue to remain subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and we file all of our required periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Because our unregistered securities cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 unless we continue to meet such requirements, any unregistered securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, will have no liquidity unless we continue to comply with such requirements. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund our operations and pay our consultants and employees with our securities instead of cash.\nThe Lateral Redemption Rights Agreement (a) could result in the dilution of existing ownership interests and significant cash payments to redeem Lateral\u2019s preferred stock interests; and (b) imposes restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to undertake certain transactions.\nIn connection with the Lateral credit agreement, the Company issued 555,344 shares of Series F preferred stock to Lateral. The Company and Lateral also entered into a Registration Rights agreement in connection with the issuance of these shares, pursuant to which the Company must file a registration statement with the SEC, with respect to the shares. In addition, the Company and Lateral entered into a Redemption Rights Agreement whereby Lateral may request redemption of some or all of its Series F preferred stock at any time after October 28, 2017, subject to the Company (a) meeting certain minimum capitalization and EBITDA requirements; and (b) being able to continue as a going concern on a post-redemption basis. The redemption price per share is variable and equals 10 (ten) times the last twelve months EBITDA, multiplied by the Lateral fully-diluted ownership percentage and then divided by the Lateral Series F preferred stock shares outstanding. In addition, Lateral was granted anti-dilution rights which permit it to receive additional equity securities to maintain its fully-diluted ownership interest to the extent that the Company issues equity securities to third parties, up to a maximum of $5,000,000. Furthermore, so long as Lateral maintains a fully-diluted ownership interest of 10% or more, the Company may not without Lateral\u2019s consent (a) enter into new indebtedness exceeding $400,000; (b) undertake a Major Transaction Event (as defined); or (c) terminate or replace its Chief Executive Officer.", "PERMNO": 17182, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "FTNW"}
