RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nThere are a number of government contracting risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Reduced demand for and/or funding for procurement of AV7909 and/or BioThrax or ACAM2000 and discontinuation of funding of our other USG procurement and development contracts.\n\u2022Inability to receive FDA licensure of AV7909 and realize the full value of our contract for development and procurement of AV7909.\nThere are a number of manufacturing risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Our inability to maintain quality and manufacturing compliance at our manufacturing facilities has hindered and could continue to hinder our ability to produce bulk drug substance for Johnson & Johnson's\nCOVID-19 vaccine and other products and product candidates for our CDMO customers.\n\u2022Disruption at, damage to or destruction of our development and/or manufacturing facilities may impede our ability to manufacture our products, as well as deliver our CDMO services.\n\u2022Our operations, including our use of hazardous materials, chemicals, bacteria and viruses expose us to significant potential liabilities.\nThere are a number of product development and commercialization risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022The COVID-19 product candidates we are working on for our CDMO customers may not be safe or effective and we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet demand.\n\u2022Clinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain.\n\u2022We may fail to capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates.\nDue to numerous factors, the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial performance, including:\n\u2022Changes in government priorities resulting from the pandemic and supply chain shortages could impact our overall business.\n\u2022COVID-19 may impede our workers ability to work and may result in reduced production of products or services.\n\u2022The evolving nature of COVID-19 and related vaccines and treatments and resulting changes in demand for such product candidates may impact sales of related services offered by our CDMO business.\nThere are a number of regulatory and compliance risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Failure to comply with complex laws and regulations pertaining to government contracts and resources required for responding to related government inquiries.\n\u2022Conditions associated with approvals and ongoing regulation of products may limit how and the extent to which we manufacture and market them.\n\u2022Failure to comply with various health care laws could result in substantial penalties.\n\u2022Failure to comply with obligations under USG pricing programs may require reimbursement for underpayments and the payment of substantial penalties, sanctions and fines.\n\u2022The extent to which we may be able to lawfully offer to sell and sell unapproved products in many jurisdictions may be unclear or ambiguous and such activities may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions.\nThere are a number of competitive and political risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products are subject to evolving private and public sector competition.\n\u2022NARCAN is currently subject to generic competition and may be subject to additional branded and generic competition.\n\u2022Biologic Products may be affected by the approval and entry of follow-on biologics, or biosimilars in the United States and other jurisdictions.\nThere are a number of risks related to our intellectual property that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Challenges in defense or enforcement of our intellectual property rights including against current or potential infringers.\n\u2022Potential discrepancies or challenges with respect to third party licenses, including our failure to comply with obligations under such licenses.\n\u2022Potential loss of proprietary information and know-how, which carries the risk of reducing the value of our technology and products.\n\u2022Entry of competing generic drugs upon patent expiry or with patents no longer in force.\nThere are a number of risks related to reliance on third parties that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022The loss of sole-source suppliers or an increase in the price of inventory.\n\u2022If third parties do not perform as contractually required or as expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nThere are a number of legal and reputational risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Unfavorable results of legal proceedings and government investigations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our work on PHTs has exposed us to criticism and may expose us to further criticism, from the media, government personnel and others, which could further harm our reputation, negatively effect on our share price, operations and our ability to attract and retain talent.\n\u2022The potential for cyber security incidents to harm our ability to operate our business effectively in light of our heightened risk profile.\n\u2022Inherent product liability exposure due to our unique business.\nThere are a number of financial risks that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our substantial debt, both now and in the future.\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional funding and be able to raise capital when needed.\n\u2022Our ability to comply with the covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt agreements.\nThere are a number of risks related to our strategic acquisitions and collaborations that could impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, including:\n\u2022Our strategy of generating growth through acquisitions may be unsuccessful.\n\u2022Our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and/or assets into our operations and our ability to realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nThere are a number of risks associated with our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Our business or our share price could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of shareholders.\n\u2022Although he is retiring, our Executive Chairman currently has the ability to exert significant influence over us with respect to the election of the members of our Board of Directors and to delay or prevent a change of\ncontrol of us, due to his substantial ownership percentage.\n\u2022The price of our common stock has been and remains subject to extreme volatility.\nThe risk factors below contain more detailed descriptions of the risks identified above, which may materially harm our business, financial condition or results of cash flows.\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS\nWe currently derive a substantial portion of our revenue from USG procurement of AV7909 and ACAM2000 and have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from USG procurement of BioThrax. If the USG\u2019s demand for and/or funding for procurement of AV7909 and/or BioThrax or ACAM2000 is substantially reduced, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be materially harmed.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our current and expected future revenues from USG procurement of AV7909. As AV7909 is a product development candidate, there is a higher level of risk that we may encounter challenges causing delays or an inability to deliver AV7909 than with BioThrax, which may have a material effect on our ability to generate and recognize revenue.\nThe success of our business and our future operating results are significantly dependent on anticipated funding for the procurement of our anthrax vaccines and the terms of such procurement by the USG, including the price per dose, the number of doses and the timing of deliveries. We have no certainty that funding will be made available for the procurement of our anthrax vaccines. If priorities for the SNS change generally, or as a result of the conclusion of the USG\u2019s audit of the SNS, or with respect to the level of procurement of our anthrax vaccines, funding to procure future doses of AV7909 or BioThrax may be delayed, limited or not available, BARDA may never complete the anticipated full transition to stockpiling AV7909 in support of anthrax preparedness, and our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of ACAM2000 to the USG. If priorities for the SNS change with respect to ACAM2000 or the USG decides not to exercise additional options under our ACAM2000 contract, our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nWe may not receive eventual FDA licensure of AV7909 in a timely manner or at all. Delays in our ability to achieve a favorable outcome from the FDA\ncould prevent us from realizing the full potential value of our BARDA contract for the advanced development and procurement of AV7909.\nIn collaboration with us, the CDC filed with the FDA a pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission package related to AV7909, which enables FDA review of data in anticipation of a request for an EUA. Following this submission, BARDA began procuring AV7909, exercising its first contract option in July 2019 to procure 10 million doses of AV7909, its second contract option in July 2020 and, most recently, funding another procurement commitment in October 2021 for inclusion of additional doses into the SNS in support of anthrax preparedness.\nWe are also working on a BLA for filing with the FDA related to AV7909 and we submitted part of the BLA to the FDA in December 2021. There can be no guarantee that we will meet our target date for the completion of our submission. Moreover, even if we do, the FDA may decide that our data are insufficient and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining FDA licensure, in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to realize the full potential value of the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, prior to FDA licensure, if we obtain an EUA, the EUA could be terminated if the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates.\nOur USG procurement and development contracts require ongoing funding decisions by the USG. Simultaneous reduction or discontinuation of funding of these contracts could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to suffer materially.\nThe USG is the principal customer for our MCMs and the primary source of funds for the development of most of our product candidates in our development pipeline, most notably our AV7909 procured product candidate. We anticipate that the USG will also be a principal customer for those MCMs that we successfully develop within our existing product development pipeline, as well as those we acquire in the future. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue comes from USG development contracts and grants. Over its lifetime, a USG procurement or development program may be implemented through the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding for such government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations, generally made on a fiscal year basis, even for programs designed to continue for several years. For example, procurement of AV7909 to be supplied under our development and procurement contract with BARDA is subject to the availability of funding, mostly from annual appropriations. These appropriations can\nbe subject to political considerations, changes in priorities due to global pandemics, the results of elections and stringent budgetary constraints.\nAdditionally, our government-funded development contracts typically give the USG the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to extend these contracts for successive option periods following a base period of performance. The value of the services to be performed during these option periods may constitute the majority of the total value of the underlying contract. For example, the September 2016 contract award from BARDA for the development and delivery to the SNS of AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease consists of a five-year base period of performance. The contract award also includes options for the delivery of additional doses of AV7909 to the SNS and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments. This contract was extended in September 2021 through 2025, and provides for additional procurement of AV7909 for the SNS over 18 months. If levels of government expenditures and authorizations for public health countermeasure preparedness decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not offer products or are not developing product candidates, or if the USG otherwise declines to exercise its options under our existing contracts, our revenues would suffer, as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to secure follow-on procurement contracts with the USG upon the expiration of any of our product procurement contracts.\nA significant portion of our revenue is substantially dependent upon product procurement contracts with the USG and foreign governments for our MCMs. Upon the expiration of a procurement contract, we may not be able to negotiate a follow-on procurement contract for the particular product for a similar product volume, period of performance, pricing or other terms, or at all. The inability to secure a similar or increased procurement contract could materially affect our revenues and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be harmed. For example, in November 2019, the BARDA procurement contract for raxibacumab that we acquired in our 2017 acquisition of the product from GlaxoSmithKline LLC was completed. We intend to negotiate a follow-on procurement contract for raxibacumab and other follow-on procurement contracts for most of our MCMs upon the expiration of a related procurement contract, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful obtaining any follow-on contracts. Even if we are successful in negotiating a follow-on procurement contract, it may be for a lower product volume, over a shorter period of performance or be on less favorable pricing or other\nterms. An inability to secure follow-on procurement contracts for our products or procured product candidates could materially and adversely affect our revenues, and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be harmed.\nThe government contracting process is typically a competitive bidding process and involves unique risks and requirements.\nOur business involves government contracts and grants, which may be awarded through competitive bidding. Competitive bidding for government contracts presents many risks and requirements, including:\n\u2022the possibility that we may be ineligible to respond to a request for proposal;\n\u2022the commitment of substantial time and attention of management and key employees to the preparation of bids and proposals;\n\u2022the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any contract that we might be awarded;\n\u2022the submission by third parties of protests to our responses to requests for proposal that could result in delays or withdrawals of those requests for proposal; and\n\u2022in the event our competitors protest or challenge contract or grant awards made to us through competitive bidding, the potential that we may incur expenses or delays, and that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids based on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nThe USG may choose not to award us future contracts for either the development of our new product candidates or for the procurement of our existing MCM products and may instead award such contracts to our competitors. If we are unable to secure particular contracts, we may not be able to operate in the market for products that are provided under those contracts. Additionally, if we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over an extended period, or if we fail to anticipate all of the costs or resources that we will be required to secure and, if applicable, perform under such contract awards, our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe amount we are paid under our fixed price government procurement contracts is based on estimates we have made of the time, resources and expenses required for us to perform under those contracts. If our actual costs exceed our estimates, we\nmay not be able to earn an adequate return or may incur a loss under these contracts, which could harm our operating results and materially reduce our net income.\nOur current procurement contracts with HHS and DoD are generally fixed price contracts. We expect that additional future procurement contracts we successfully secure with the USG would likely also be fixed price contracts. Under a fixed price contract, we are required to deliver our products at a fixed price regardless of the actual costs we incur. Estimating costs that are related to performance in accordance with contract specifications is difficult, particularly where the period of performance is over several years. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract could reduce the profitability of such a contract or cause a loss, which could harm our operating results and materially reduce our net income.\nUnfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may subject our business to material limitations, restrictions and uncertainties and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nGovernment contracts customarily contain provisions that give the USG substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the USG to:\n\u2022terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason;\n\u2022unilaterally reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts;\n\u2022decline, in whole or in part, to exercise an option to purchase product under a procurement contract or to fund additional development under a development contract;\n\u2022decline to renew a procurement contract;\n\u2022claim certain rights to facilities or to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract;\n\u2022require repayment of contract funds spent on construction of facilities in the event of contract default;\n\u2022take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u2022direct the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u2022suspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u2022pursue civil or criminal remedies under acts such as the False Claims Act and False Statements Act; and\n\u2022control or prohibit the export of products.\nGenerally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the USG\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the USG terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the USG terminates a contract for default, the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. All of our development and procurement contracts with the USG are terminable at the USG's convenience with these potential consequences.\nIn addition, our USG contracts grant the USG the right to use technologies developed by us under the government contract or the right to share data related to our technologies, for or on behalf of the USG. Under our USG contracts, we may not be able to limit third parties, including our competitors, from accessing certain of these technology or data rights, including intellectual property, in providing products and services to the USG.\nMANUFACTURING RISKS\nAn inability to maintain manufacturing compliance at our manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe FDA conducts periodic inspections of our manufacturing facilities for compliance with cGMP requirements relating to quality control. The failure to maintain compliance with such standards at our manufacturing facilities has hindered and could continue to hinder our ability to continue manufacturing for CDMO customers, including the bulk drug substance for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nDisruption at, damage to or destruction of our manufacturing facilities could impede our ability to manufacture anthrax vaccines, ACAM2000 or our other products, as well as impact the delivery of CDMO services, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAny further interruptions in our manufacturing operations could result in our inability to produce products and product candidates for delivery to satisfy the demands of our customers in a timely manner, which would reduce our revenues and materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including:\n\u2022equipment malfunctions or failures;\n\u2022technology malfunctions;\n\u2022cyber-attacks;\n\u2022work stoppages or slowdowns, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022civil unrest and protests, including by animal rights activists;\n\u2022injunctions;\n\u2022damage to or destruction of one or more facilities;\n\u2022FDA facility inspection findings/recommendations; and\n\u2022product contamination or tampering.\nProviders of MCMs could be subject to an increased risk of terrorist activities. The USG has designated both our Lansing, Michigan and our Bayview bulk manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland as facilities requiring additional security. Although we continually evaluate and update security measures, there can be no assurance that any additional security measures would protect these facilities from terrorist efforts determined to disrupt our manufacturing activities.\nThe factors listed above could also cause disruptions at our other facilities. We do not have any redundant manufacturing facilities for any of our products. Accordingly, any damage to, or disruption or destruction of one or more of our facilities could impede our ability to manufacture our products, our product candidates and our ability to provide manufacturing and development services for external customers, result in losses and delays, including delays in the performance of our contractual obligations or delays in our clinical trials, any of which could be costly to us and materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nProblems may arise during the production of our products and product candidates, as well as those we produce for our CDMO customers, due to the complexity of the processes involved in their development, manufacturing and shipment. Significant delays in product manufacturing or development and our ability to ramp up production to meet the needs of our customers could cause delays in recognizing revenues, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe majority of our products and product candidates are biologics. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex. The products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly-defined manufacturing process. Problems during manufacturing may arise for a variety of reasons, including problems with raw materials, equipment malfunction and failure to follow specific protocols and procedures. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining materials, maintaining master seed or cell banks and preventing genetic drift, seed or cell growth, fermentation, contamination including from particulates among other things, filtration, filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, potency and stability issues and other quality control testing, may result in lot failures or manufacturing shut-downs, delays in the release of lots, product recalls, spoilage or regulatory action. Such deviations may require us to revise manufacturing processes or change manufacturers. Additionally, as our equipment ages, it will need to be replaced, which has the potential to result in similar consequences. Success rates can also vary dramatically at different stages of the manufacturing process, which can reduce yields and increase costs. From time to time, we may experience deviations in the manufacturing process that may take significant time and resources to resolve and, if unresolved, may affect manufacturing output and could cause us to fail to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts, lead to delays in our clinical trials, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, including the issuance of Forms FDA 483, warning letters and other restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, or cause the FDA to cease releasing product until the deviations are explained and corrected, any of which could be costly to us, damage our reputation and negatively impact our business. For example in April 2021, we temporarily stopped manufacturing bulk drug substance material for Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine at our Baltimore Bayview facility after issues were identified in a viral vaccine drug substance batch\nAdditionally, if changes are made to the manufacturing process, we may be required to provide the FDA with pre-clinical and clinical data showing the\ncomparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of any impacted products before and after the changes.\nWe are contractually required to ship our biologic products at a prescribed temperature range and variations from that temperature range could result in loss of product and could significantly and adversely impact our revenues, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may not be able to ramp up our manufacturing processes to meet the rapidly changing demand or specifications of our customers on the desired timeframe, if at all. For example, we have not previously had to ramp our organization for a commercial launch of any product or manufacture any product for our CDMO customers at the current pace required to address treatments related to COVID-19 and doing so in a pandemic environment with an urgent, critical global need creates unique manufacturing challenges, challenges related to distribution channels, and the need to establish teams of people with the relevant skills. Our inability to ramp up manufacturing to meet the demand or specifications of our customers or the inability to timely obtain regulatory authorization to produce the products or product candidates of our customers could also harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur products and product candidates procured by the USG and other customers require us to perform tests for and meet certain potency and lot release standards prescribed by the FDA and other agencies, which may not be met on a timely basis or at all.\nOur products and product candidates procured by the USG and other customers require us to perform tests for and meet certain potency and lot release standards prescribed by the FDA and other agencies, which may not be met on a timely basis or at all. We are unable to sell any products and product candidates that fail to satisfy such testing specifications. For example, we must provide the FDA with the results of certain tests, including potency tests, before certain lots are released for sale. Potency testing of each applicable lot is performed against qualified control lots that we maintain. We continually monitor the status of such reference lots for FDA compliance and periodically produce and qualify a new reference lot to replace the existing reference lot. If we are unable to satisfy USG requirements for the release of our products or product candidates, our ability to supply such products and product candidates to authorized buyers would be impaired until such time as we become able to meet such requirements, which could materially harm our future business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur operations, including our use of hazardous materials, chemicals, bacteria and viruses, require us to comply with regulatory requirements and expose us to significant potential liabilities.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, bacteria and viruses, and may produce dangerous waste products. Accordingly, we, along with the third parties that conduct clinical trials and manufacture our products and product candidates on our behalf, are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern the use, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, exposure, disposal and recordkeeping with respect to these materials. Under the Federal Select Agent Program, pursuant to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, we are required to register with and be inspected by the CDC and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service if we have in our possession, or if we use or transfer, select biological agents or toxins that could pose a threat to public health and safety, to animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. This legislation requires stringent safeguards and security measures for these select agents and toxins, including controlled access and the screening of entities and personnel and establishes a comprehensive national database of registered entities. We are also subject to a variety of environmental and occupational health and safety laws. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations in this area can require significant costs and we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance. In addition, the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In such event, we could be held liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of hazardous materials. From time to time, we have been involved in remediation activities and may be so involved in the future. Any related cost or liability might not be fully covered by insurance, could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition to complying with environmental and occupational health and safety laws, we must comply with special regulations relating to biosafety administered by the CDC, HHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the DoD, as well as regulatory authorities in Canada.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION RISKS\nThe COVID-19 product candidates we are working on for our CDMO customers may not be safe or effective and even if they are, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet demand.\nWe are providing CDMO services for the development and/or manufacture of multiple vaccine and therapeutic product candidates. There can be no assurance that any of these product candidates will be safe or effective. There can also be no assurance that any of these product candidates will be authorized for emergency use or approved by the FDA or any other health regulatory authority or that our facilities will receive authorization from the FDA to release additional batches of COVID-19 drug substance. Even if these product candidates are safe and/or effective and receive authorization or approval by a health regulatory authority or we receive authorization to produce drug substance at our facilities, the manufacturing processes for our CDMO COVID-19 programs are under development and are complex. There can be no assurance that we will be able to produce any significant quantity of these product candidates in a timely basis or at all, or negotiate further commitments under our existing CDMO contracts to manufacture vaccines against COVID-19, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur growth depends on our success in developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to commercialize these product candidates, or experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have invested significant efforts and financial resources in the development of our vaccines, therapeutics and medical device product candidates and the acquisition of additional product candidates. In addition to our product sales, our ability to generate revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including the success of our development programs, the USG's interest in providing development funding for or procuring certain of our product candidates, and the commercial viability of our acquired or developed product candidates. The commercial success of our product candidates can depend on many factors, including accomplishing the following in an economical manner:\n\u2022successful development, formulation and cGMP scale-up of manufacturing that meets FDA or other foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022successful program partnering;\n\u2022successful completion of clinical or non-clinical development;\n\u2022receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishment of commercial manufacturing processes and product supply arrangements;\n\u2022training of a commercial sales force for the product;\n\u2022successful registration and maintenance of relevant patent and/or other proprietary protection;\n\u2022competitive pricing and market access; and\n\u2022acceptance of the product by potential government and other customers.\nClinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. We must invest substantial amounts of time and financial resources in these trials, which may not yield viable products. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates, particularly in the United States, could materially and adversely affect our financial resources, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, we and our collaborative partners, where applicable, must conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to establish proof of concept and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Pre-clinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of such trials do not necessarily predict final results. An unexpected result in one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nPre-clinical and clinical testing for certain of our MCM product candidates may face additional difficulties and uncertainties because they cannot ethically or feasibly be tested in human subjects. We therefore expect to rely on the Animal Rule to obtain regulatory approval for some of our MCM product candidates. The Animal Rule permits, for certain limited diseases and circumstances, the use of animal efficacy studies, together with human clinical safety and immunogenicity trials, to support an application for marketing approval. For a product approved under the Animal Rule, certain additional post-marketing requirements apply. For example, to the extent feasible and ethical, applicants must conduct post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit and to assess its safety when used as indicated. It is possible that results from the animal efficacy studies used to support approval under the Animal Rule may not be predictive of the actual efficacy of our product candidates in humans.\nPrior to FDA approval of certain MCM product candidates, the Secretary of HHS can contract to purchase MCMs for the SNS under Project BioShield\nunder specific circumstances. Under PAHPRA, the USG may also, at its discretion, purchase critical biodefense products for the SNS prior to FDA approval after the filing of a pre-EUA application with the FDA. If our MCM product candidates are not procured or funded under Project BioShield, or do not qualify for EUA, they generally will have to be fully approved by the FDA through traditional regulatory mechanisms prior to sale and distribution in the United States.\nWe may experience unforeseen events or issues during, or as a result of, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials or animal efficacy studies. These issues and events, which could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, include, among others:\n\u2022our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities for use in trials;\n\u2022the unavailability or variability in the number and types of subjects for each study;\n\u2022safety issues or inconclusive or incomplete testing, trial or study results;\n\u2022drug immunogenicity;\n\u2022lack of efficacy of product candidates during the trials;\n\u2022government or regulatory restrictions or delays; and\n\u2022greater than anticipated costs of trials.\nWe may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates.\nWe continue to evaluate our product development strategy and, as a result, may modify our strategy in the future. In this regard, we may, from time to time, focus our product development efforts on different product candidates or may delay or halt the development of various product candidates. We may change or refocus our existing product development, commercialization and manufacturing activities based on government funding decisions. This could require changes in our facilities and our personnel. Any product development changes that we implement may not be successful. In particular, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates or choose candidates for which government development funds are not available. Our decisions to allocate our R&D, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better business opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate product\ndevelopment programs may also prove to be incorrect and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nGLOBAL PANDEMIC RISK\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial performance.\nOur business, operations and financial condition and results have been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to varying degrees. The pandemic has presented a number of risks and challenges for our business, including, among others, government-mandated work-from-home or shelter-in-place orders; manufacturing disruptions and delays, including at our Baltimore Bayview facility, supply chain interruptions or delays, including challenges related to reliance on third-party suppliers; disruptions to pipeline development and clinical trials and decreased product demand for our travel health vaccines due to the significant reduction in international travel. Additional travel restrictions and other governmental measures may result in further disruptions or continued delays in delivery of supplies by our third-party contractors and suppliers.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our efforts and those of our collaborative partners to develop a potential treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, including uncertainties related to pre-clinical or clinical trials, the risk that such development programs may not be successful, commercially viable, or that EUA or regulatory approval will not be received from regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, the trading price of our common stock, and that of other biopharmaceutical companies, has been highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as a result of investor concerns and uncertainty related to the impact of the pandemic on the economies of countries worldwide. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the pandemic and variants of COVID-19 further negatively impact our business, affect the supply chain, disrupt key clinical trials, divert government funding away from our primary procured products and product candidates due to changes in government priorities and potential delays in the delivery of products to our customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. The ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19 and new variants of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, further travel restrictions\nand social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response, including the changing demand for various COVID-19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world, may affect the demand for COVID-19 product candidates manufactured by our CDMO business.\nThrough our CDMO business, we provide services for a variety of product candidates intended for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 and its symptoms and effects. These services include product development, the manufacture of bulk drug substance and drug product fill and finish services.\nNone of the COVID-19-related product candidates we develop and manufacture have yet to receive full regulatory approval from any regulatory authority, although some are being offered and sold pursuant to an EUA from the FDA or the equivalent authorization from non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Should the facilities producing these product candidates be denied an EUA or one or more of these COVID-19-related product candidates be denied an EUA (or equivalent) or be denied full regulatory approval by the FDA or other major non-U.S. regulatory authority, the demand for such product candidates could decrease significantly and therefore decrease customer orders for additional CDMO services for such product candidates. Additionally, the need for continued manufacture and supply of vaccines (including potential \u201cbooster\u201d doses) and therapies to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including new and developing variants of COVID-19, is highly uncertain and subject to various political, economic and regulatory factors that are outside of our control. Should the United States or other major regions worldwide determine that additional manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, or therapies is no longer necessary, or necessary to a lesser degree, it could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition and our ability to grow our CDMO business in the near term. In addition, highly-public political and social debate relating to the need for, efficacy of, or side effects related to one or more specific COVID-19 vaccines could contribute to changes in public perception of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by us, which could decrease demand for a COVID-19 related product candidate we develop or manufacture (in whole or in part).\nThe impact of COVID-19 may further impede our employees\u2019 ability to work and may result in reduced production or services.\nOne of the significant areas of impact of COVID-19 on our business has been the disruption of our employees\u2019 ability to work effectively. A significant number of our administrative employees continue to work from home due to policies necessitated by COVID-19. Working remotely could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations. In addition, our on-site staff conducting R&D may not be able to access our laboratories if conditions worsen, due to COVID-19 variants, state and local restrictions, and these core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for extended periods of time.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from the COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdowns, or other disruptions to these agencies\u2019 operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 2020 when foreign and domestic inspections of facilities were largely placed on hold, the FDA has been working to resume routine surveillance, bioresearch monitoring and pre-approval inspections on a prioritized basis. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. As of May 2021, certain inspections, such as foreign\npreapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical, remain temporarily postponed. In April 2021, the FDA issued guidance for industry formally announcing plans to employ remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates and in May 2021 announced plans to continue progress toward resuming standard operational levels. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA does not determine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter or defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed.\nAs of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. If such disruption continues, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nREGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nThere are a number of complex laws and regulations that pertain to government contracts and compliance with those laws and regulations require significant time and cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAs a manufacturer and supplier of MCMs to the USG addressing PHTs, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations govern how we transact business with our government clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs and related obligations on our business operations. For a detailed description of the most significant regulations that affect our government contracting business, see the prior discussion under \u201cRegulation - Government Contracting.\u201d\nWe may be subject to government investigations of compliance with government acquisition regulations. USG agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. Even though we take significant precautions to identify, prevent and deter fraud, misconduct and non-compliance, we face the risk that our personnel or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud or improper activities. If we are audited or investigated and such audit or investigation were to uncover improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties, administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from government contracting, and suffer significant reputational harm. The loss of our status as an eligible government contractor or significant fines or penalties associated with contract non-compliance or resulting from investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop, receive regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates we develop or acquire and, if we are not successful, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may suffer.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with them are subject to extensive FDA regulation and oversight, as well as oversight by other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. This includes, but is not limited to, laws and regulations governing product development, including testing, manufacturing, record keeping, storage and approval, as well as advertising and promotion. In limited circumstances, governments may procure products that have not obtained regulatory approval. In all other circumstances, failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from selling and commercializing the product candidate.\nIn the United States, to obtain approval from the FDA to market and sell any of our future drug, biologic, or vaccine products, we will be required to submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA. Ordinarily, the FDA requires a company to support an NDA or BLA with substantial evidence of the product candidate\u2019s effectiveness, safety, purity and potency in treating the targeted indication based on data derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, including Phase 3 trials conducted in patients with the disease or condition being targeted.\nHowever, many of our MCM product candidates, for example, may take advantage of a different regulatory approval pathway under the FDA\u2019s \u201cAnimal Rule.\u201d Under the Animal Rule, efficacy must be demonstrated, in part, by utilizing animal models rather than testing in humans. We cannot guarantee\nthat the FDA will permit us to proceed with licensure of any of our MCM product candidates under the Animal Rule. Even if we are able to proceed under the Animal Rule, product development can take a considerable amount of time, and the FDA may decide that our data are insufficient to support approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies, refuse to approve our products, or place restrictions on our ability to commercialize those products. Furthermore, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to certain additional post-marketing requirements. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet this regulatory requirement even if one or more of our product candidates are approved under the Animal Rule.\nThe process of obtaining these regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate involved. Changes in the regulatory approval process may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. There is a high rate of failure inherent in this process, and potential products that appear promising at early stages of development may fail for a number of reasons, and positive results from pre-clinical studies may not be predictive of similar results in human clinical trials. Similarly, promising results from earlier clinical trials of a product candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials.\nThere are many other difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical R&D that could significantly delay or otherwise materially delay our ability to develop future product candidates, mostly related to clinical trials.\nFailure to successfully develop future product candidates may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOnce an NDA or BLA is submitted, the FDA has substantial discretion and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient to support approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies.\nUnapproved and investigational stage products are also subject to the FDA's laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion, which prohibit the promotion of both unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved products. There is some risk that the FDA could conclude that our communications relating to unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products constitute the promotion of an unapproved product or product use in violation of FDA laws and regulations. There is also a risk that a regulatory authority in another country could take a similar position under that country's laws\nand regulations and conclude that we have violated the laws and regulations related to product development, approval, or promotion in that country. Therefore, there is a risk that we could be subject to enforcement actions if found to be in violation of such laws or regulations.\nEven if we or our collaborators obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the conditions of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture, market and sell our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOnce approval has been granted, an approved product and its manufacturer and marketer remain subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation.\nWe and our collaborators must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to FDA-regulated products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we will not be able to sell any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.\nIf we and our collaborators are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market and sell any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAny product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and\nrecordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine.\nCertain of our products are subject to post marketing requirements (PMRs), which we are required to conduct, and post marketing commitments (PMCs), which we have agreed to conduct. The FDA has the authority to take action against sponsors who fail to meet the obligations of a PMR, including civil monetary penalties and/or misbranding charges.\nThe FDA and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), closely regulate and monitor the pre-approval and post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA, DOJ, and OIG impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved products and if we market unapproved products or market our approved products for unapproved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action. Violations of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturing partners or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in various penalties and sanctions. For all FDA-regulated products, if the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or that a product is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, including but not limited to:\n\u2022restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022restrictions on distribution or use of a product;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that are submitted;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNon-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the EU and other legal and regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Non-compliance with similar requirements in other foreign jurisdictions can also result in enforcement actions and significant penalties.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), passed in 2010 substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry. However, some provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented and certain provisions have been subject to legal and political challenges, as well as efforts by the last Presidential administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. On January 28, 2021, however, the President issued an executive order to strengthen implementation of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress\nconsidered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties as of January 1, 2019 for not complying with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the current Presidential administration issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period during 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. It is unclear how healthcare reform measures enacted by Congress or implemented by the current Presidential administration or other challenges to the ACA, if any, will impact the ACA or our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted that may negatively impact us. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. These Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended through the end of March 2022. From April 2022 through June 2022 a 1% sequester cut will be in effect, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter.\nAdditionally, there has been recent heightened federal governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and has been proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies\nfor drug products. For example, the last Presidential administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers.\nFor example, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA.\nFurther, on July 9, 2021, the President signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat \"excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.\" On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical\nproducts and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIf we fail to comply with foreign, federal, state and local health care laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and antitrust laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn the United States, certain of our products are reimbursed under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and/or state pharmaceutical assistance programs. Many foreign countries have similar laws. Federal and state laws designed to prevent fraud and abuse under these programs prohibit pharmaceutical companies from offering valuable items or services to customers or potential customers to induce them to buy, prescribe, or recommend our product (the so-called \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws). Exceptions are provided for discounts and certain other arrangements if specified requirements are met. Other federal and state laws, and similar foreign laws, not only prohibit us from submitting any false information to government reimbursement programs but also prohibit us, our employees, or any third party acting on our behalf from doing anything to cause, assist, or encourage our customers to submit false claims for payment to these programs. We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign antitrust and competition laws that prohibit certain activities that may have an impact against potential competitors. Violations of the various fraud and abuse and antitrust laws may result in severe penalties against the responsible employees and us, including jail sentences, large fines, and the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal and state programs. Some of the laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, prescribing or recommendation of an item, good, facility or service reimbursable by a\nfederally funded health care program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid program. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been interpreted broadly and may constrain our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with health care providers or other entities, among other activities;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability, including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties.\n\u2022the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d or independent\ncontractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity;\n\u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations require certain manufacturers of drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to report certain payments and transfers of value made to U.S. physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; state, local and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, obtain pharmaceutical agent licensure, and/or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to health care providers and entities; and state, local and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to health care providers or entities, or marketing expenditures.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenges under one or more of such laws. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services\nresulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or otherwise, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, exclusion from funded health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any such penalties could adversely affect our financial results. We continue to improve our corporate compliance program designed to ensure that our development, marketing, and sales of existing and future products and product candidates are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with health care laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, exclusion from government funded health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If a third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations while acting on our behalf, we may also be subject to criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including those listed above.\nWe are committed to conducting the development, marketing and sale of our applicable products and product candidates and all of our activities in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but certain applicable laws and regulations may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should an employee or third party acting on our behalf violate these laws without our knowledge, a governmental authority may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions on us.\nThe United States government, state governments and private payors regularly investigate the pricing and competitive practices of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, and many file actions alleging that inaccurate reporting of prices has\nimproperly inflated reimbursement rates. We may also be subject to investigations related to our pricing practices. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n\u2022Diversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022Significant legal fees and payment of damages or penalties;\n\u2022Limitations on our ability to continue certain operations;\n\u2022Decreased product demand; and\n\u2022Injury to our reputation.\nMoreover, an adverse outcome, or the imposition of penalties or sanctions for failing to comply with the fraud and abuse and antitrust laws, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under U.S. governmental pricing programs, we could be required to reimburse government programs for underpayments and could pay penalties, sanctions and fines.\nThe issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid rebate program will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance and will be time-consuming. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price (AMP), and the Medicaid rebate amount under the ACA and CMS and the issuance of final regulations implementing those changes has affected and could further affect our 340B \u201cceiling price\u201d calculations. Because we participate in the Medicaid rebate program, we are required to report average sales price (ASP), information to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid for under Part B of the Medicare program. Future statutory or regulatory changes or CMS binding guidance could affect the ASP calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs, involve complex calculations and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current AMP and \u201cbest price\u201d for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Any such revisions could have the\nimpact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid rebate program. Price recalculations also may affect the \u201cceiling price\u201d at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B/Public Health Service (PHS) drug pricing program.\nIn addition, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, we are subject to civil monetary penalties for each such price misrepresentation and for each day in which such price misrepresentation was applied. If we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP or \u201cbest price\u201d information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Any refusal of a request for information or knowing provision of false information in connection with an AMP survey verification would also subject us to civil monetary penalties. In addition, our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP or \u201cbest price\u201d information on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, under which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIn order for our products to be reimbursed by the primary federal governmental programs, we must report certain pricing data to the USG. Compliance with reporting and other requirements of these federal programs is a pre-condition to: (i) the availability of federal funds to pay for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B; and (ii) procurement of our products by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), and by covered entities under the 340B/PHS program. The pricing data reported are used as the basis for establishing Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), and 340B/PHS program contract pricing and payment and rebate rates under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs, respectively. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws for submitting inaccurate and/or incomplete pricing information to the government that resulted in increased payments made by these programs. Although we maintain and follow strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible integrity\nfor our federal pricing calculations, the process for making the required calculations is complex, involves some subjective judgments and the risk of errors always exists, which creates the potential for exposure under the false claims laws. If we become subject to investigations or other inquiries concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, and our methodologies for calculating federal prices are found to include flaws or to have been incorrectly applied, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also must participate in the DVA FSS pricing program. To participate, we are required to enter into an FSS contract with the DVA, under which we must make our innovator \u201ccovered drugs\u201d available to the \u201cBig Four\u201d federal agencies-the DVA, the DoD, the PHS (including the Indian Health Service), and the Coast Guard-at pricing that is capped under a statutory federal ceiling price (FCP) formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA). The FCP is based on a weighted average wholesale price known as the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the DVA. Under the VHCA, knowingly providing false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject us to significant penalties for each item of false information. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Section 703 Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to disclose the error and refund the difference to the government. The failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, can be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nFrom time to time, we sell unapproved MCMs to government entities under certain circumstances. While this is permissible in some cases, the extent to which we may be able to lawfully offer to sell and sell unapproved products in many jurisdictions may be unclear or ambiguous. Such sales could subject us to regulatory enforcement action, product liability and reputational risk.\nUnder certain circumstances, MCMs may be procured by government entities prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, a practice which we follow in connection with certain MCMs, including AV7909 and TROBIGARD in the United States. In the United States, Project BioShield permits the Secretary of HHS to contract to purchase MCMs for the SNS prior to FDA approval of the MCM in specified circumstances. Project BioShield and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 also allow the FDA Commissioner to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA under an EUA. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates. An EUA is not a long-term alternative to obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for a product. Absent an applicable exception, our MCM product candidates generally will have to be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities in the relevant country through traditional pathways before we can sell those products to governments. Additionally, the laws in certain jurisdictions regarding the ability of government entities to purchase unapproved product candidates are ambiguous, and the permissibility of exporting unapproved products from the United States and importing them to foreign countries may be unclear. Nevertheless, government bodies, such as U.S. federal entities other than HHS, state and local governments within the United States, and foreign governments have sought and may further seek to procure our MCM product candidates that are not yet approved. If so, we would expect to assess the permissibility and liability implications of supplying our product candidates to such entities on a case-by-case basis, which presents certain challenges, both in the case of U.S. and foreign governments, and particularly under emergency conditions. In addition, agencies or branches of one country\u2019s government may take different positions regarding the permissibility of such sales than another country\u2019s government or even other agencies or branches of the same government. If local enforcement authorities disagree with our conclusion that such activities are permissible, they may take enforcement action against us.\nIn addition, the sale of unapproved products also could give rise to product liability claims for which we may not be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage. For example, liability protections applicable to claims arising under U.S. law and resulting from the use of certain unlicensed or unauthorized products, such as a declaration issued under the PREP Act, may lead plaintiffs to assert that their claims are not barred under the PREP Act.\nRegardless of the permissibility and liability risks, in the event a user of one or more of our products suffers an adverse event, we may be subject to\nadditional reputational risk if the product has not been approved by the FDA or the corresponding regulatory authority of another country, particularly because we will not have approved labeling regarding the safety or efficacy of those products. In addition, legislatures and other governmental bodies that have oversight responsibility for procuring agencies may raise concerns after the fact, even if procurement was permissible at the time, which could result in negative publicity, reputational risk and harm to our business prospects.\nThere is also a risk that our communications with governments about our unapproved products, such as in the procurement context, could be considered promotion of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product. Therefore, there is a risk that we could be subject to enforcement actions if found to be in violation of such laws or regulations.\nEven after regulatory approval is received, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our approved products, they could be subject to restrictions, penalties or withdrawal from the market.\nIn addition to the requirements and uncertainties related to the pre-approval activities discussed previously, any vaccine, therapeutic product or medical device for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to the continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Our approved products are subject to these requirements and ongoing review. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, plasma donor testing, registration requirements, cGMP, requirements relating to potency and stability, quality control, quality assurance, restrictions on advertising and promotion, import and export restrictions and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, various state laws require that companies that manufacture and/or distribute drug products within the state obtain and maintain a manufacturer or distributor license, as appropriate. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nGovernment regulators enforce cGMP and other requirements through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA is authorized to inspect domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities without prior notice at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner. Health Canada may conduct similar inspections of our domestic and foreign facilities where products offered and sold in Canada are produced, or related formulation and filling operations are conducted. The\nFDA, Health Canada, and other foreign regulatory agencies conduct periodic inspections of our facilities. Following several of these inspections, regulatory authorities have issued inspectional observations, some of which were significant, but all of which are being, or have been, addressed through corrective actions. If, in connection with any future inspection, regulatory authorities find that we are not in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements, or if they are not satisfied with the corrective actions we take, our regulators may undertake enforcement action against us, which may include:\n\u2022warning letters and other communications;\n\u2022product seizure or withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nSimilar action may be taken against us should we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or later discover previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes. For instance, our products are tested regularly to determine if they satisfy potency and stability requirements for their required shelf lives. Failure to meet potency, stability or other specification requirements could result in delays in distributions, recalls or other consequences. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or sold or to the conditions of approval. Regulatory approval may also contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. If we experience any of these post-approval events, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, companies may not promote unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved products (i.e. \u201coff-label\u201d uses or uses that are not described in the product\u2019s approved labeling and that differ from the uses approved by the applicable regulatory agencies). A company that is found to have improperly promoted an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies (such as entering into\ncorporate integrity agreements with the USG), as well as criminal sanctions. If our employees or agents engage in marketing of an unapproved product or the unapproved use of an approved product, we could be subject to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and injunctive penalties, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct business in certain markets, negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and damage our reputation.\nFailure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad and could limit the growth of our business.\nWe currently sell certain of our products outside the United States and intend to expand the countries in which we sell our products and have received market authorization under the mutual recognition procedure to sell BioThrax in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom. To market or sell our products in foreign jurisdictions under normal circumstances, we generally need to obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying requirements or use alternative \u201cemergency use\u201d or other exemptions from general approval and import requirements. Approval by the FDA in the United States or the mutual recognition procedure in the European member states does not ensure approval by all foreign regulatory authorities. The approval procedures in foreign jurisdictions can vary widely and can involve additional clinical trials and data review beyond that required by the FDA or under the mutual recognition procedure. There is also a risk that a regulatory authority in another country could conclude that we have violated the rules and regulations related to product development, approval or promotion in that country. Therefore, there is a risk that we could be subject to a foreign enforcement action if found to be in violation of such laws and regulations. We and our collaborators may not be able to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, and we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products in desired jurisdictions internationally if no alternate procurement pathway is identified for authorized government customers in a particular jurisdiction. We have limited experience in preparing, filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to gain foreign regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations and consultants to assist us in this process. Our reliance on third parties can introduce additional uncertainty into the process.\nAs of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA), became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas\nNorthern Ireland will continue to be subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended). or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law of the body of European Union law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nAs we continue to expand our commercialization activities outside of the United States, we are subject to an increased risk of, and must dedicate additional resources towards avoiding inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and other similar foreign laws, which prohibit corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the Company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nMany countries, including the United States, also have various lobbying laws and regulations governing the conduct of individuals and companies who interact with government officials. These laws and regulations typically include certain restrictions and disclosure obligations. We believe we are currently in compliance\nwith such laws and regulations. If we, our employees, or third parties acting on our behalf do not comply with these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nMany countries, including the United States, restrict the export or import of products to or from certain countries through, for example, bans, sanction programs, and boycotts. Such restrictions may preclude us from supplying products in certain countries, which could limit our growth potential. Furthermore, if we, or third parties acting on our behalf, do not comply with these restrictions, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we continue to expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nCOMPETITIVE AND POLITICAL RISKS\nDevelopment and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, including for PHT preparedness, are routinely subject to evolving private and public sector competition.\nThe development and commercialization of new biopharmaceutical and medical technology products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological advances. We may face future competition from other companies and governments, universities and other non-profit research organizations in respect to our products, any products that we acquire, our current product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. The market for current products can be subject to development of safer, more effective, more convenient or less costly products. The market for current products can also depend on what resources can be devoted to marketing or selling products, or how companies are positioned to adapt more quickly to new technologies, respond to scientific advances or patient preferences and needs, initiate or withstand substantial price\ncompetition and/or procure third-party licensing and collaborative arrangements.\nThere are a number of companies with products or product candidates addressing PHT preparedness that are competing with us for both USG procurement and development resources. Factors to consider include competitors' financial, technical, marketing and selling resources as well as potential leverage that their intellectual property estates may offer.\nAny reduction in demand for our products or reduction or loss of development funding for our products or product candidates in favor of a competing product could lead to a loss of market share for our products and cause reduced revenues, margins and levels of profitability for us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur Biologic Products may face risks of competition from biosimilar manufacturers.\nBiological products and product candidates, otherwise referred to as our \u201cBiologic Products,\u201d can be affected by the approval and entry of \u201cbiosimilars\u201d in the United States and other jurisdictions. Biosimilar drugs are \u201chighly similar,\u201d but close enough in duplication to accomplish the same therapeutic and clinical result. Biologic Products in our current pipeline include AV7909, BioThrax, and ACAM2000. If a biosimilar version of one of our Biologic Products were approved, it could have a material adverse effect on the sales and gross profits of the affected Biologic Product and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nNARCAN\u00ae (naloxone HCI) Nasal Spray is currently subject to generic competition and may be subject to additional branded and generic competition in the future.\nNARCAN currently faces generic competition. In 2016, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA (collectively, Teva) filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN. In patent litigation related to Teva\u2019s ANDA filing, a trial Court decided in favor of Teva, and this decision was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nOn December 22, 2021, Teva commenced the launch of their generic naloxone nasal spray. On the same date, Sandoz initiated distribution of an authorized generic naloxone nasal spray having entered into agreement with Emergent for this purpose.\nNARCAN may face additional generic competition from other parties, including from Perrigo UK FINCO Limited Partnership (Perrigo), who filed their own ANDA in 2018. Emergent settled with Perrigo on\nFebruary 12, 2020 providing for a license effective upon the Teva litigation decision.\nSales of generic versions of NARCAN at prices lower than our branded product or provided at no cost by Teva have the potential to erode our sales and could impact our product revenue related to NARCAN. For example, certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician, mandate the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available. In addition, in January 2019, the FDA released new proposed template Drug Facts Labels to assist sponsors of investigational naloxone nasal sprays and auto-injectors seeking approval from the FDA for over-the-counter naloxone products.\nNARCAN may also face branded competition. For example, on April 30, 2021, the FDA approved Kloxxado\u2122, a branded product developed by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which delivers a higher dose naloxone nasal spray. In addition, Orexo AB and Harm Reduction Therapeutics both have development programs for novel naloxone nasal spray formulations intended for use in opioid overdose reversal.\nAdditional branded competition may correspond to other injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits including Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s naloxone injection product and Kal\u00e9o's EVZIO\u2122 (naloxone HCI injection) Auto-Injector.\nPolitical or social factors may delay or impair our ability to market and sell our products and may require us to spend significant management time and financial resources to address these issues.\nProducts developed to counter the potential impact of PHTs are subject to changing political and social environments. The political responses and social awareness of the risks of these threats on military personnel or civilians and the level of emphasis placed on such risks by the USG may vary over time. If the threat of terrorism were to decline, then the public perception of the risk on public health and safety may be reduced. This perception, as well as political or social pressures, could delay or cause resistance to bringing our products in development to market or limit pricing or purchases of our products, any of which could negatively affect our revenues and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, substantial delays or cancellations of purchases could result from protests or challenges from third parties. Lawsuits brought against us by third parties or activists, even if not successful, could require us to spend significant management time and financial resources defending the related litigation and\ncould potentially damage the public's perception of us and our products. Any publicity campaigns or other negative publicity may adversely affect the degree of market acceptance of our MCMs and thereby limit the demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for product candidates we may develop, and even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same product for the same therapeutic indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States.\nIn order for the FDA to grant orphan drug exclusivity to one of our products, the agency must find that the product is indicated for the treatment of a condition or disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. The FDA may conclude that the condition or disease for which we seek orphan drug exclusivity does not meet this standard. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA or such authorities conclude that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or condition.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nProtection of our intellectual property rights is an important tool for sustaining our business and the failure to do so could impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe actively seek to protect intellectual property rights related to our Company's assets, including patent rights, trademark rights, trade secrets and proprietary confidential information, through defense\nand enforcement of existing rights and pursuit of protection on new and arising innovations.\nObtaining, maintaining and defending our intellectual property rights in the United States and other countries remains a critical component of the development and commercialization of our Company's assets.\nSome of the risks associated with procurement, maintenance and enforcement of intellectual property rights include changes in patent laws or administrative patent office rules, evolving criteria and eligibility of obtaining patent protection on particular subject matter, the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, the potential scope of coverage of our intellectual property rights, and/or the availability or strength of legal remedies in a particular country to defend and enforce intellectual property rights.\nOther risks include associated costs, such as costs of patent prosecution and maintenance and costs associated with post-grant challenges. For example, such costs include inter partes review (IPR) proceedings in the United States and oppositions in Europe, as well as costs associated with litigating and enforcing patent and trademark rights.\nAdditional risks include limitations on our extent or ability to procure, maintain or defend intellectual property rights associated with in-licensed or acquired intellectual property, where, for example, third parties may have the first right to maintain or defend intellectual property rights in which we have an interest, or may pursue strategies that are divergent to the interest of our Company.\nThird party challenges for patent infringement could impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nChallenges by third parties for alleged patent infringement could delay or affect the development and commercialization of our products. Such challenges, while ongoing, could be costly, requiring and utilizing company resources. Such challenges, if successful, may impact marketing or launch of products, or require ongoing license and/or royalty fees associated with potential settlement agreements. These may have the potential to materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nIntellectual property licenses with third parties carry risks of challenges, which may be costly and time consuming and could impact the commercialization of our products.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Such license agreements or collaboration arrangements can be subject to\nchallenges if interests or expectations under such license agreements diverge. Such challenges may be costly, risk time and resources, and could delay or impact development, commercialization or launch of our products.\nPotential loss of proprietary information and know-how generally carries the risk of reducing the value of our technology and products.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes, and know-how, particularly as to our proprietary manufacturing processes. These types of confidential information and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect this confidential information, in part, through agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties, as well as confidentiality policies and audits, although these may not always be successful in protecting our trade secrets and confidential information.\nOne or more of our products could be subject to early competition from generic drugs and biosimilars.\nOne or more of our products is approved as a drug product under the provisions of the FDCA, which may render it susceptible to potential competition from generic manufacturers via the Hatch-Waxman Act and ANDA process. Other of our products may be susceptible to challenges by entry of biosimilars through the route established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Action of 2009.\nAlthough we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in our enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Our existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable, or found not to cover a generic form of our product.\nRISKS RELATED TO RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nThe loss of any of our non-exclusive, sole-source or single source suppliers, a shortage of related supplies or an increase in the price of inventory supplied to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase certain supplies used in our manufacturing processes from non-exclusive, or single sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We depend on certain single-source suppliers for key materials and services necessary to manufacture the majority of our products and certain product candidates. For example, we rely on a single-source supplier to provide us with Alhydrogel in sufficient quantities to meet our needs to manufacture AV7909 and BioThrax and the specialty plasma in our hyperimmune specialty plasma products and certain ingredients for ACAM2000. We also rely on single-source suppliers for the materials necessary to\nproduce NARCAN, such as the naloxone active pharmaceutical ingredient and other excipients, along with the vial, stopper and device.\nWhere a particular single-source supply relationship is terminated, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for certain components or materials quickly. This is largely due to the FDA approval system, which mandates validation of materials prior to use in our products, and the complex nature of manufacturing processes. In addition, we may lose a sole-source supplier due to, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 on such supplier, the acquisition of a supplier by a competitor (which may cause the supplier to stop selling its products to us) or the bankruptcy of such a supplier, which may cause the supplier to cease operations. Any reduction or interruption by a sole-source supplier of the supply of materials or key components used in the manufacturing of our products or product candidates, a reduction in quality or an increase in the price of those materials or components could adversely affect us. If we are unable to locate or establish alternative suppliers, our ability to manufacture our products and product candidates could be adversely affected and could harm our revenues, cause us to fail to satisfy contractual commitments, lead to a termination of one or more of our contracts or lead to delays in our clinical trials, any of which could be costly to us and otherwise materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct many of our clinical and non-clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and, as a result, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may suffer.\nWe depend on third parties, such as independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical and non-clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so. We rely heavily on these third parties for successful execution of our clinical and non-clinical trials, but do not exercise day-to-day control over their activities. Our reliance on these service providers does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practice regulations and the plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application. In addition, these organizations may not complete these activities on our anticipated or desired timeframe. We also may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a contract research organization may lead us\nto seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternative service provider, which may prove difficult, costly and result in a delay of our trials. Any delay in or inability to complete our trials could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn certain cases, government entities and NGOs conduct studies of our product candidates, and we may seek to rely on these studies in applying for marketing approval for certain of our product candidates. These government entities and NGOs have no obligation or commitment to us to conduct or complete any of these studies or clinical trials and may choose to discontinue these development efforts at any time. Furthermore, government entities depend on annual Congressional appropriations to fund their development efforts, which may not be approved.\nIf we are unable to obtain any necessary third-party services on acceptable terms or if these service providers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.\nLEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nOur financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nWe are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have not yet been fully resolved, including stockholder derivative and putative class action lawsuits, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by us sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving us, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. Certain of these actions include, and future actual or threatened legal actions may include, claims for substantial and indeterminate amounts of damages, or may result in other actions adverse to us.\nFor example, multiple purported class action lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our current and former senior officers in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of our common stock during various date ranges. The complaints, allege, among other things, that we made materially false and misleading statements regarding our procedures and quality controls relating to vaccine\nproduction, in violation of federal securities laws. As another example, multiple stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of the Company against certain current and former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and insider trading, each allegation related to the Company\u2019s capabilities to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine bulk drug substance. In addition to monetary damages, the complaints seek the implementation of multiple corporate governance and internal policy changes.\nIn addition, we have received inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents from Representative Carolyn Maloney and Representative Jim Clyburn, members of the Oversight Committee and the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Senator Murray of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice), the SEC, the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office, and the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office. We are producing and have produced documents as required in response and will continue to cooperate with these government inquiries.\nRegardless of merit, litigation can be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is also inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against us or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, our financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against us and could require us to change our business practices or limit our ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nWe rely significantly on information technology systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively or result in data leakage of proprietary and confidential business and employee information.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology\nsystems, including Internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. We also have contracted with the USG and pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, for the development and manufacture of a significant quantity of COVID-19 vaccines, and separately we are working on a proprietary COVID-19 therapeutic with support from the USG and other private sector entities, which has raised our security profile, and heightened potential risks that malicious actors may seek to disrupt our systems or misappropriate our information. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to interruption, invasion, computer viruses, destruction, malicious intrusion and additional related disruptions, which may result in the impairment of production and key business processes. Our systems are also potentially vulnerable to data security breaches through employee error, phishing scams and malfeasance, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. No system of protection is adequate to protect against all such threats, even if they are deemed to be industry standard, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to repel any such attacks. Data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or the public exposure of personal information, including sensitive personal information, of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others. Responding to any such threats may also be expensive and time-consuming.\nA significant business disruption or a breach in security resulting in misappropriation, theft or sabotage with respect to proprietary and confidential business and employee information could result in significant financial losses, legal, business or reputational harm to us, compromise our business prospects and our commitments to the USG or other customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur work on PHTs has exposed us to criticism and may expose us to further criticism, from the media, government personnel, and others, that can negatively affect our share price, reputation, operations, and our ability to attract and retain talent and secure new customer contracts.\nOur work on PHTs, including manufacturing issues at our Baltimore Bayview facility, has exposed us to criticism and may expose us to additional potential criticism, from the media, government personnel, and others. In addition, our work on PHTs has exposed us to governmental inquiries and investigations, including by Congress and other government agencies. For example, a joint panel of the U.S. House of Representatives launched an\ninvestigation into, among other things, the cause of the previously mentioned cross-contamination issues identified in a viral vaccine drug substance batch at the Baltimore Bayview facility. Such criticism can be particularly acute during a public health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic. The unfavorable media coverage and increased government scrutiny, including the Congressional inquiry, could further harm our reputation, distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, and impact our ability to attract and retain talent and result in further declines to our share price. We have already incurred significant legal costs to respond to government inquiries and are likely to incur additional costs. Any adverse actions by government authorities may result in significant civil or criminal fines or penalties, all of which could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe face product liability exposure, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products, any other products that we successfully acquire or develop and the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials.\nOne measure of protection against such lawsuits is coverage under the PREP Act, which was signed into law in December 2005. The PREP Act creates liability protection for manufacturers of biodefense countermeasures when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is meant to provide liability protection from all claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure under a government contract. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying certain of our products, namely BioThrax, ACAM2000, raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered countermeasures, which expire this year. Manufacturers are not entitled to protection under the PREP Act in cases of willful misconduct or for cases brought in non-U.S. tribunals or under non-U.S. law. We cannot predict whether the Secretary of HHS will renew the declarations when they expire, whether Congress will fund the relevant PREP Act compensation programs, or whether the necessary prerequisites for immunity would be triggered with respect to our products or product candidates.\nAdditionally, certain of our products, namely BioThrax and RSDL, are certified anti-terrorism products covered under the protections of the SAFETY Act. The SAFETY Act creates product liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for\nclaims arising from or related to an act of terrorism. Although we are entitled to the benefits of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, the SAFETY Act may not provide adequate protection from claims made against us.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against future claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries and if we are not entitled to indemnity by the USG, or the USG does not honor its obligations to us under the PREP Act or SAFETY Act, or if the liability protections under the PREP Act and SAFETY Act are not adequate to cover all claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand or withdrawal of a product;\n\u2022injury to our reputation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022loss of revenue; and\n\u2022an inability to commercialize products that we may develop.\nThe amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Further product liability insurance may be difficult and expensive to obtain. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy all potential liabilities. For example, we may not have sufficient insurance against potential liabilities associated with a possible large-scale deployment of BioThrax as a countermeasure to a bioterrorism threat. We rely on PREP Act protection for BioThrax, raxibacumab, ACAM2000, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, and SAFETY Act protection for BioThrax and RSDL in addition to our insurance coverage to help mitigate our product liability exposure for these products. Additionally, potential product liability claims related to our commercial products, including NARCAN, Vivotif and Vaxchora, may be made by patients, health care providers or others who sell or consume these products. Such claims may be made even with respect to those products that possess regulatory approval for commercial sale. Claims or losses in excess of our product liability insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness in connection with our acquisitions and servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to further refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may also seek additional debt financing to support our ongoing activities or to provide additional financial flexibility. Debt financing can have significant adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to payment on our debt, which would reduce available funds for other corporate initiatives;\n\u2022increasing the amount of interest that we have to pay on debt with variable interest rates, if market rates of interest increase, to the extent we are unable to offset such risk through our hedging instruments;\n\u2022subjecting us, as under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028 (Senior Unsecured Notes), to restrictive covenants that reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions, acquire companies, products or technology, or obtain further debt financing;\n\u2022requiring us to pledge our assets as collateral, which could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, better debt servicing options or stronger debt servicing capacity.\nWe may not have sufficient funds or be able to obtain additional financing to pay the amounts due under our indebtedness. In addition, failure to comply with the covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt agreements, including the maintenance of a specified consolidated net leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. An event of default could result in the acceleration of amounts due under a particular debt agreement and a cross default and acceleration under other debt agreements, and we may not have sufficient funds to pay or be able to\nobtain additional financing to make any accelerated payments. Under these circumstances, our lenders could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness.\nOur current indebtedness restricts and any additional debt financing may restrict the operation of our business and limit the cash available for investment in our business operations.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a $450 million Term Loan Facility which had an outstanding principal balance was $396.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and the ability to borrow up to $600 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, of which we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2021. On August 7, 2020, we completed an offering of $450 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes, of which $353 million of the net proceeds were used to pay down our Revolving Credit Facility. We may also seek additional debt financing to support our ongoing activities or to provide additional financial flexibility. Debt financing can have significant adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u2022the level, timing and cost of product sales and CDMO services;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in and integrate companies, businesses, products or technologies;\n\u2022the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities;\n\u2022the payment obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities;\n\u2022our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs;\n\u2022the extent to which we repurchase common stock under any future share repurchase program; and\n\u2022the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution.\nOur hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk.\nWe manage our interest rate risk in part by entering into interest rate swaps with a number of counterparties to swap a portion of our indebtedness that is based on variable interest rates to a fixed rate. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract. During\nan economic downturn, the counterparty's financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure. In the event of a counterparty default, we could incur losses, which may harm our business and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty.\nWe may require significant additional funding and be unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, which would harm our ability to grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. In August 2021, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d under SEC rules (which include, among other things, the timely filing of our reports under the Exchange Act and maintenance of at least $700 million of public float or issuing an aggregate amount of $1 billion of non-convertible securities, other than common stock, in registered offerings for cash during the past three years), this shelf registration statement, effective until August 9, 2024, allows us to issue an unrestricted amount of equity, debt and certain other types of securities through one or more future primary or secondary offerings. If we do not file a new shelf registration statement prior to August 9, 2024, the existing shelf registration statement will expire, and we will not be able to publicly raise capital or issue debt until a new registration statement is filed and becomes effective. There can be no assurance that we will be eligible to file an automatically effective shelf registration statement at a future date when we may need to raise funds publicly.\nIf we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Senior Unsecured Notes, limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our Senior Secured Credit\nFacilities as well as the indenture governing the Senior Unsecured Notes restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nEconomic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected, and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.\nWe may not maintain profitability in future periods or on a consistent basis.\nAlthough we have been profitable on an annual basis since becoming a public company, we have not been profitable for every quarter during that time. Our profitability has been substantially dependent on product sales, which historically have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate significantly based primarily on the timing of our fulfillment of orders from the USG. We may not be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly basis or sustain or increase profitability on an annual basis.\nThe expansion of our international operations increases our risk of exposure to credit losses.\nAs we continue to expand our business activities with foreign governments in certain countries that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions or otherwise, our exposure to uncollectible accounts will rise. Global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of accounts receivable and may result in credit losses. Future governmental actions and customer specific actions may require us to re-evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and we may potentially incur credit losses that materially impact our operating results.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates based on LIBOR and certain of our financial contracts are also indexed to LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR.\nOn December 31, 2021, the International Exchange (ICE) Benchmark Association, which administrates LIBOR, ceased (i) entering into new\ncontracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate and (ii) publication of two LIBOR rates (one-week and two-month) and has announced that the remaining LIBOR rates (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month) will be retired on June 30, 2023. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2023. We have certain financial contracts, including the amended credit agreement related to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our interest rate swaps, that are indexed to LIBOR. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness. Any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. The transition away from LIBOR may result in increased expenses, may impair our ability to refinance our indebtedness or hedge our exposure to floating rate instruments, or may result in difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS\nOur strategy of generating growth through acquisitions may not be successful.\nOur business strategy includes growing our business through acquisition and in-licensing transactions. We may not be successful in identifying, effectively evaluating, structuring, acquiring or in-licensing, and developing and commercializing additional products on favorable terms, or at all. Competition for attractive product opportunities is intense and may require us to devote substantial resources, both managerial and financial, to an acquisition opportunity. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to acquire or in-license products in the biopharmaceutical field. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, cost of capital, effective tax rate and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nAcquisition efforts can consume significant management attention and require substantial expenditures, which could detract from our other programs. In addition, we may devote significant resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed. Even if we are successful in acquiring a\ncompany or product, it may not result in a successfully developed or commercialized product or, even if an acquired product is commercialized, competing products or technologies could render a product noncompetitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Moreover, the cost of acquiring other companies or in-licensing products could be substantial, and in order to acquire companies or new products, we may need to incur substantial debt or issue dilutive securities.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our efforts to acquire other companies or in-license and develop additional products, or if we acquire or in-license unproductive assets, it could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, and we could be compelled to record significant impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and/or assets into our operations could adversely affect our ability to realize the benefits of such acquisitions and, therefore, to grow our business.\nWe may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably. In addition, cost synergies, if achieved at all, may be less than we expect, or may take greater time to achieve than we anticipate.\nIssues that could delay or prevent successful integration or cost synergies of an acquired business or products include, among others:\n\u2022retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022retaining key employees;\n\u2022diversion of management attention and resources;\n\u2022conforming internal controls, policies and procedures, business cultures and compensation programs;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022successfully executing technology transfers and obtaining required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022consolidating sales and marketing operations;\n\u2022identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u2022assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u2022managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations; and\n\u2022risks associated with intellectual property rights related to an acquisition or collaboration.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate pending and future acquisitions with our existing businesses, or operate any acquired business profitably, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect the growth of our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur business or our share price could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of shareholders.\nIn recent years, some shareholders have placed increasing pressure on publicly traded companies in our industry and others to effect changes to corporate governance practices, executive compensation practices, social and environmental practices and to undertake certain corporate actions. This may be true even if they only hold a minority of shares. In addition, many institutional investors are increasingly focused on ESG factors. These investors may be seeking enhanced ESG disclosures or to implement policies adverse to our business. There can be no assurances that shareholders will not publicly advocate for us to make corporate governance changes or engage in certain corporate actions. Responding to challenges from shareholders, such as proxy contests, media campaigns or other public or private means, could be costly and time consuming and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and divert the attention and resources of management and our board, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operational results. Any such shareholder actions or requests, or the mere public presence of shareholders with a reputation for taking such actions among our shareholder base, could also cause the market price of our common stock to experience periods of significant volatility.\nAlthough he is retiring, Fuad El-Hibri, executive chairman of our Board of Directors, currently has significant influence over us through his substantial beneficial ownership of our common stock, including an ability to influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors, or delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nAlthough Mr. El-Hibri is retiring after the end of the first quarter of 2022, he currently has the ability to significantly influence the election of the members of our Board of Directors due to his substantial beneficial ownership of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Mr. El-Hibri was the beneficial owner of approximately 9% of our outstanding\ncommon stock. As a result, Mr. El-Hibri could exercise substantial influence over corporate actions requiring board or stockholder approval, including a change of control, or any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws. The control by Mr. El-Hibri may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. In addition, Mr. El-Hibri's significant beneficial ownership of our shares could present the potential for a conflict of interest.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law may discourage acquisition proposals, delay a change in control or prevent transactions that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other changes in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nThese provisions include:\n\u2022the classification of our directors;\n\u2022limitations on changing the number of directors then in office;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022limitations on filling vacancies on the board;\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors and other proposals;\n\u2022the inability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue a new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThe affirmative vote of holders of our capital stock representing at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote is required to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. The affirmative vote of either a majority of the directors present at a meeting of our Board of Directors or holders of our capital stock representing at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote is required to amend or repeal our by-laws.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (Section 203). In general and subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held corporation from\nengaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us.\nOur Board of Directors may implement a new stockholder rights plan without stockholder approval, which could prevent a change in control of us in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests.\nOur Board of Directors may implement a stockholder rights plan without stockholder approval. We previously implemented a stockholder rights plan, which expired on November 14, 2016. Under our prior stockholder rights plan, we issued to each of our stockholders one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock. Each right, when exercisable, would have entitled its holder to purchase from us a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of series A junior participating preferred stock at a purchase price of $150 in cash, subject to adjustments. Our stockholder rights plan was intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire us and to provide our Board of Directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers.\nOur Board of Directors may implement a new stockholder rights plan, which may have anti-takeover effects, potentially preventing a change in control of us in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests. This could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that our Board of Directors does not believe are in our best interests or those of our stockholders and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.\nOur stock price is volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political\ninstability. From November 15, 2006, when our common stock first began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, through February 18, 2022, our common stock has traded as high as $137.61 per share and as low as $4.17 per share. Due to fears associated with COVID-19, the stock market has been experiencing extreme volatility and the market for biopharmaceutical companies has generally experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022contracts, decisions and procurement policies by the USG affecting our anthrax vaccines and our other products and product candidates;\n\u2022CDMO contracts related to COVID-19 with collaboration partners;\n\u2022the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022results of clinical and non-clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022announcements of acquisitions, financings or other transactions by us;\n\u2022litigation or legal proceedings;\n\u2022public concern as to the safety of our products;\n\u2022termination or delay of a development program;\n\u2022the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022variations in our product revenue and profitability; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nBecause we currently do not pay dividends, investors will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe currently do not pay dividends on our common stock. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Unsecured Notes limit and any future debt agreements that we enter into may limit our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders based on current expectations.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock could result in dilution of our stockholders and could cause our share price to decline.\nWe expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies\nto expand our operations or for general corporate purposes. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, and we may sell convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell such common stock, convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, existing stockholders may be materially diluted.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any additional material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nInternal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could impact our financial information and disclosures, require significant resources to remediate, and expose us to legal or regulatory proceedings.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. In the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our technical accounting assessment of the BARDA COVID-19 Development Public Private Partnership and CDMO revenue contracts and related accounting judgments primarily focused on (a) the scoping of lease and non-lease components and (b) the recognition of revenue.\nAlthough the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2021, our system of\ninternal controls, however well-designed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting, or the internal controls of other companies we may acquire, are not effective, or we discover additional areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nOur success is dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and any failure to attract or retain key personnel may negatively affect our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors largely depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial and key scientific and technical personnel (including quality and manufacturing personnel). If we are unable to retain the services of one or more of the principal members of senior management or other key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy could be materially harmed. We face intense competition for qualified employees from biopharmaceutical companies, research organizations and academic institutions. Attracting, retaining or replacing these personnel on acceptable terms may be difficult and time-consuming given the high demand in our industry for similar personnel. We believe part of being able to attract, motivate and retain personnel is our ability to offer a competitive compensation package, including equity incentive awards. If we cannot offer a competitive compensation package to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow our business.", "PERMNO": 91571, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EBS"}
