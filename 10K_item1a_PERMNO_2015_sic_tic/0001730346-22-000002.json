Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA decline in the production of CCRs by our coal-fired utility industry customers due to environmental regulations or otherwise could negatively impact our profitability and hinder our growth.\nMany of our services are dependent upon the production of CCRs by our coal-fired utility industry customers. The coal-fired utility industry faces several new and pending initiatives by regulatory authorities seeking to address air and water pollution, GHG emissions, and the management and disposal of CCRs. In recent years, federal and state environmental regulations have imposed more stringent requirements regarding the emission of air pollutants and other toxic chemicals, reduction of GHG emissions, and water quality impacts from coal operations. Adoption of more stringent regulations governing coal combustion, water discharges, or air emissions may decrease the amount of CCRs produced by our customers and, as a result, the demand for our services. Faced with the prospect of more stringent regulations, litigation by environmental groups, and the relatively low cost of natural gas, an increasing number of electric utilities are reducing their portfolio of coal-fired power plants. The pace of the reduction may increase due to changes in the U.S. executive administration, Congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership. This reduction could cause states to substitute electricity generation from higher-emitting coal plants with low-emitting coal and natural gas plants and zero-emitting renewable sources. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nIncreasingly strict requirements generally will increase the cost of doing business and may make burning coal less attractive for utilities. In recent years, multiple companies have announced plans to close coal-fired power plant units or plants or dropped plans to open new plants, citing the cost of compliance with pending or new environmental regulations and the relatively low cost of natural gas. A reduction in coal use as fuel would cause a decline in the production and availability of CCRs, which would adversely affect our byproduct services offerings and result in reduced revenue. The outcome of these developments cannot be predicted but could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and any future major public health crisis could disrupt the Company's operations and adversely impact its business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including new and emerging strains and variants, continues to have adverse effects on the U.S. and global economies. This outbreak has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies, supply chains, and global transportation and financial markets. While the Company has not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic and any future major public health crisis could impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition in the future. For example, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, whether it is due to illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or any future major public health crisis. However, the significance of the impact on our operations going forward is not yet certain and depends on numerous evolving factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict or effectively respond to, including, without limitation: the COVID-19 pandemic or any future major public health crisis, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response, the effect on economic activity and actions taken in response, the effect on customers and their demand for the Company\u2019s products and services and the timing of such demand, the ability of our subcontractors to perform under their contracts due to their own financial or operational difficulties, the availability of subcontractors and other talent, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the COVID-19 virus or any future major public health crisis, including vaccine efficacy, distribution and widespread public acceptance, and the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations, including without limitation as a result of supply chain challenges, facility closures, social distancing, restrictions on travel, fear or anxiety by the populace and shelter-in-place orders.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.\nWe derive our revenue from the performance of customer contracts which itself is dependent on new contract awards. Reductions in the number and amounts of new awards, delays in the timing of the awards, or potential cancellations of such awards resulting from economic conditions, material and equipment pricing, and availability or other factors could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will be awarded large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process that is affected by market conditions as well as regulatory requirements. We have experienced difficulty in the timely award of new projects and may again in the future. Because we generate our revenue from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement and progress of work under awarded contracts. Also, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for a project to proceed. If we are\nunable to secure the awards of new contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may lose existing contracts through competitive bidding or early termination.\nMany of our contracts are for a specified term and are subject to competitive rebidding after the term for such contract expires. Although we intend to bid to extend expiring contracts, we may not always be successful. Also, some or all of our customers may terminate their contracts with us before their scheduled expiration dates. If we are not able to replace lost revenue resulting from unsuccessful competitive bidding, early termination, or the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenue within a reasonable period, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be precluded from entering into or maintaining permits or certain contracts if we are unable to obtain sufficient third-party financial assurance or adequate insurance coverage.\nOur operations sometimes require us to obtain performance or surety bonds, letters of credit, or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance. We currently obtain performance and surety bonds from multiple financial institutions; however, if we are unable to obtain financial assurance in the future in sufficient amounts from appropriately rated sureties or on acceptable terms, we could be precluded from entering into certain additional contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill management or other contracts or operating permits. Any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon having adequate insurance coverage.\nUnsatisfactory service and safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenue.\nOur ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with our customers\u2019 standards of service as well as applicable laws, rules, and permits, which are subject to change. Existing and potential customers consider the safety and service record of their third-party service providers to be of high importance in their decision to engage such providers. The power generation industry generally emphasizes safety and service over cost due to economic and reputational risk associated with operations at their facilities.\nWe may experience multiple or particularly severe accidents in the future, causing our safety record to deteriorate. This possibility may be more likely as we continue to grow, if we experience high employee turnover or a labor shortage or hire inexperienced personnel to support our staffing needs. If one or more accidents were to occur while we are providing services to our customers, or if we were unable to maintain the level of safety and service our customers require, the affected customer may seek to terminate our services and may be less likely to use our services in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they view our safety or service record as unacceptable.\nOur ERT services will require us to acquire significant real property and assume liabilities that could adversely impact our future results.\nAs part of our ERT services, we will purchase real and personal property and assume environmental liabilities. We will plan to sell these acquired assets to third parties. However, the timing of these future dispositions is difficult to predict, and we may not be able to realize the gains on sales as anticipated. If we cannot sell these assets, the assets may be written down to their fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a non-cash charge in the consolidated statement of operations. Furthermore, these services will require us to assume environmental liabilities with long-term monitoring requirements. If actual costs exceed our cost estimates, we may incur future additional liabilities, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe loss of a large customer may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nWe will likely continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us promptly or at all, our revenue would be negatively impacted, and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if we were to lose any material customer, such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe and our customers operate in industries subject to significant environmental regulation, and compliance with changes in, or liabilities under, such regulations could add significantly to the costs of conducting business.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that, among other matters, impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid, hazardous, and radioactive waste materials, the remediation of releases of hazardous substances, and the reclamation of land. We and our customers have obtained various federal, state, and\nlocal environmental permits to conduct our operations, and we must comply with these permits and processes and procedures regulatory authorities have approved. Any failure to comply with these environmental requirements could give rise to sanctions, including, but not limited to: i) the cessation of all or part of our operations, ii) substantial fines and penalties, iii) environmental or reclamation liabilities, which liabilities may be strict and joint and several and iv) damages, including natural resource damages in connection with our sites, customer sites, or sites to which we sent wastes, including CCRs, and third-party claims. Moreover, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly environmental requirements could require our customers or us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance. New regulations, failure to comply with existing regulations, or environmental liabilities arising thereunder could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nSuccess by environmental groups in convincing the EPA to restrict beneficial uses of CCRs, or to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn April 2015, the EPA published the CCR Rule to regulate the disposal of CCRs, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired power plants, as non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA and to distinguish the beneficial use of CCRs from disposal, which became effective in October 2015. The CCR Rule establishes national minimum criteria for CCR landfills and impoundments consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements, post-closure care, recordkeeping and reporting and other requirements, and requires closure of facilities unable to comply with these criteria within five to seven years. The CCR Rule has increased the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of CCRs and remediating existing ash ponds and landfills. Also, Congress passed the WIIN Act in December 2016, which, among other things, authorizes state permit programs to manage CCRs in place of the CCR Rule. The WIIN Act also gives the EPA the authority to regulate coal ash in states that choose not to implement state permitting programs and in states whose permitting programs are determined to be inadequate by the EPA. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule that would take further steps under the WIIN Act by granting states with approved CCR permit programs (or the EPA where it is the permitting authority) the ability to set specific alternative performance standards. The rule would also allow CCRs to be used during certain closure situations. Finally, it addresses certain matters remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2016, including clarifying corrective action triggers and requirements, adding boron to the list of constituents triggering corrective action, determining the proper height of woody and grassy vegetation for slope protection, and modifying alternative closure procedures. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed the deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline to August 31, 2020, but to allow certain extensions. The EPA extended the comment period on this legacy CCR surface impoundment advance notice of proposed rulemaking through February 23, 2022 on three proposals and until March 25, 2022 on a fourth proposal.\nSome environmental groups continue to urge the EPA to restrict certain beneficial uses of CCRs, such as in concrete, road base, and soil stabilization, alleging contaminants may leach into the environment. The CCR Rule created a definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d that includes uses in concrete and road base, but changes in the definition could reduce the demand for fly ash and other CCRs, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. Moreover, if the EPA were to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste, we, together with CCR generators, could be subject to environmental cleanup, personal injury, and other possible claims and liabilities that could result in significant additional costs. Any such changes in or new regulations or indemnity obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the deterioration of our customers' financial condition. If any of our customers suffer financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur future results of operations may be affected by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, natural disaster, pandemic, volatility or deterioration in the capital markets or credit markets, inflation, deflation, or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business, resulting in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and their nonpayment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments. Additionally, downturns in U.S. construction could lower the demand for our byproduct services and raw material sales offerings.\nWe also provide service to power generators. To the extent these entities suffer significant financial difficulties, they could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or to renew contracts with us on attractive terms. Our customers' inability, particularly larger customers, to pay us promptly or to pay increased rates could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in the course of our business, we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the customer's financial distress or bankruptcy, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts\nreceivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter bankruptcy, it could result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with that customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenue.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower profits than anticipated.\nPricing on fixed unit price contracts is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for an agreed-upon price irrespective of our actual costs. We only generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which requires us to estimate our costs accurately, control our actual costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. As a result, these types of contracts could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.\nThe costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid or contract;\n\u2022failure to include required materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum contract;\n\u2022delays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\n\u2022contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders or contract price adjustments;\n\u2022changes in availability, proximity and costs of materials, including steel, concrete, aggregates and other construction materials (such as stone, gravel, sand and oil for asphalt paving), as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;\n\u2022higher than anticipated costs to lease, acquire and maintain equipment;\n\u2022availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;\n\u2022rapidly increasing labor costs;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or our personnel;\n\u2022mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\n\u2022citations issued by a government authority, including OSHA;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\n\u2022changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022uninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\n\u2022delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues that arise during the execution of a project.\nIncreases in labor costs or our ability to find, employ and deploy technically skilled labor could impact our financial results.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We compete with other businesses in our markets for qualified employees. From time to time, the labor supply is tight in some of our markets. Labor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs from time to time, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively\naffect our ability to complete our construction projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we dispose of CCRs and distribute our raw material sales offerings to customers primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nDependence on third-party subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect our profits.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors and equipment manufacturers to complete many of our projects. We could experience losses to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials or if the amount we are required to pay for these goods or services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price contracts in the performance of these contracts. Also, if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason including, but not limited to, the deterioration of its financial condition, we may be required to purchase the services, equipment or materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the expected profit or result in a loss on a project, negatively impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe service a significant portion of our contracts with our own construction equipment rather than leased or rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy construction equipment necessary for our needs, either due to a lack of available funding or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, which could increase the costs of performing our contracts.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services can be very expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain such assets. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our business, or if the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of equipment, vehicles and construction supplies, could increase our costs or cause delays in our ability to complete our projects, which could have an adverse impact on our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely on our supply chain for equipment, vehicles and construction supplies in order to complete our projects. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant natural disaster, shortages in global freight capacity, significant increases in the price of critical components, a failure to appropriately forecast or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, or volatility in demand for our products and services could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Our vendors and subcontractors also may be unable to meet our demand, significantly increase lead times for deliveries or impose significant price increases that we are unable to offset through alternate sources of supply, price increases to our customers or increased productivity in our operations. In some cases, we procure certain inputs and services from single or limited suppliers or subcontractors. In the event of supply disruptions from these suppliers or subcontractors, we may not be able to diversify our resources for such materials or services in a timely manner or may experience quality issues with alternate sources. Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in large part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of equipment and vehicles from our suppliers, and significant disruptions in their supply could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.\nOur employees perform services that involve certain risks, including risks of accident, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.\nSafety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Our services can place our employees and others in challenging environments near large equipment, dangerous processes and highly toxic or caustic materials. Our operations involve risks, such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, and natural disasters, which could potentially result in releases of CCR materials, injury or death of employees and others, or a need to shut down or reduce the operation of our customers\u2019 facilities while we undertake remedial actions. We are responsible for safety on the sites where we work, and these risks expose us to potential liability for pollution and other environmental damages, personal injury, loss of\nlife, business interruption, and property damage or destruction. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, increase costs and raise our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries.\nAlthough we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety, and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts, or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability and the potential loss of customers. If we were to incur substantial liabilities above any applicable insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal weather patterns and other factors, making it difficult to predict our future performance.\nConsumption of energy is seasonal, and any variation from normal weather patterns, including due to unseasonably cooler or warmer weather, can have a significant impact on energy demand. Additionally, adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and severe cold weather, may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers\u2019 operations and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.\nOur byproduct services and raw material sales offerings are also subject to quarterly fluctuations from time to time. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenue may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Changes in cost estimates relating to our services, which under the cost-to-cost input method of accounting principles could lead to significant fluctuations in revenue or changes in the timing of our recognition of revenue from such services, could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to compete effectively with larger and better-capitalized companies.\nWhile no specific company provides the range of services that we offer, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and require substantial labor and capital resources. Some of the markets in which we compete or plan to compete are served by one or more large national companies and regional and local companies of varying sizes and resources, some of which may have accumulated a substantial reputation in their markets. Some of our competitors may also be better capitalized than we are, have greater name recognition than we do, or provide or be willing to bid their services at a lower price than we may be willing to offer. Our inability to compete effectively could hinder our growth or adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on technology in our business, and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe invest in new technology and processes to provide higher-margin offerings for our customers while limiting and managing our environmental risk. We also depend on digital technologies to process and record financial and operating data, and we rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. The failure of our technology initiatives and systems to perform as we anticipate or a delay in implementing new technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the roll-out of our technology initiatives, including our EnviroSourceTM ash beneficiation technology, has been slower than previously anticipated, resulting in lower than expected contribution to operating results.\nAdditionally, if competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing such competitors to provide lower-priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, this could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets fully, or if competitors are able to replicate our technology or services, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nThough we do not have patents or patent applications relating to many of our key processes and technology, if we cannot maintain our trade secrets' confidentiality, or if our competitors replicate our technology or services, our competitive advantage would be diminished. Further, our competitors may develop or employ comparable technologies or processes.\nIn addition, third parties, from time to time, may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly regardless of the merits of any claim, is inherently unpredictable, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, irrespective of its outcome.\nAdditionally, we currently license certain third-party intellectual property in connection with our business, and the loss of any such license could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions, integrate acquired businesses successfully or successfully complete divestitures, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our growth.\nFrom time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other businesses and business lines that could enhance our technical capabilities, complement our current services, or expand the breadth of our markets. Any completed acquisition's success will depend on our ability to integrate the acquired business into our existing operations effectively. The process of integrating acquired businesses or dispositions may involve unforeseen difficulties or liabilities and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Also, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms, or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in our liquidity or capital requirements that may vary substantially over time.\nOur operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital, sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures. Environmental liabilities could result in significant cash outflows, including those arising from various customer contracts and acquisition agreements that require us to indemnify for certain environmental liabilities, litigation risks, unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions, contract initiation or completion delays, political conditions, client payment problems and professional liability claims.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could preclude us from bidding on certain projects.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Sureties typically issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we are unable to obtain or renew a sufficient level of bonding, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be precluded from bidding on certain projects or successfully contracting with certain customers, which could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur debt consists primarily of our borrowings under the Company\u2019s 8.50% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and for equipment financing through notes payables and capital lease obligations. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total indebtedness of $199.7 million, excluding debt issuance costs of $11.4 million. A significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or have future borrowings available to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nOur indebtedness could have significant consequences, including the following:\n\u2022require us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more leveraged than our competitors;\n\u2022 limit our ability to deduct our interest expense;\n\u2022 make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nTo the extent that we incur new debt in addition to our current debt levels, the leverage risks described above would increase.\nOur variable rate indebtedness related to borrowings under our Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement subjects us to interest rate risk, and the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) could have an adverse impact on us.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that LIBOR would be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023. In the same announcement, banks were instructed to stop writing contracts using LIBOR by the end of 2021, and all contracts using LIBOR should wrap up by June 30, 2023. We expect that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or \u201cSOFR\u201d), published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will replace U.S. Dollar LIBOR as the principal reference rate for U.S. Dollar-denominated floating rate instruments. However, the manner and timing of this shift are currently unknown. SOFR is an overnight rate instead of a term rate, making SOFR an inexact replacement for LIBOR.\nBorrowings under our Asset-Based Lending Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Our Credit Agreement contains LIBOR benchmark replacement provisions and has identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for the U.S. LIBOR. However, at this time, there can be no assurance as to whether this alternative benchmark or resulting interest rates may be more or less favorable than LIBOR or any other unforeseen impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR. As a result, the proposals or consequences related to this transition could have a material adverse effect on our debt service obligations, financing costs, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and could impair our access to the capital markets.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies to process and record financial and operating data, and we rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber-security threats. Our technologies, systems, and networks and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Despite our considerable expenditures and efforts to secure our systems, our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As the sophistication of cyber incidents continues to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue modifying or enhancing our protective measures or investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, or other security breaches or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be subject to judicial, administrative, or other third-party proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. In the future, individuals, citizen groups, trade associations, community groups, or environmental activists may bring actions against us in connection with our operations that could interrupt or limit the scope of our business. Many of these proceedings could raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. These proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, or other losses, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Also, under our service agreements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to our conduct and the services we provide thereunder.\nWith respect to all such proceedings, we have and will, when warranted in the future, accrue expenses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). If such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued expenses or at material amounts, the outcome could materially and\nadversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our liquidity position.\nWe recognize revenue from construction contracts using the cost-to-cost input method; therefore, variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from construction contracts using the cost-to-cost input method permitted under GAAP, under which we measure the percentage of revenue to be recognized in a given period by the percentage of costs incurred to date on the contract to the total estimated costs for the contract. The cost-to-cost input method, therefore, relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis as the work progresses. Adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of contracts revenue or costs are reflected in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions, judgment and experience but are subject to the risks inherent in estimates, including unanticipated delays or technical complications. Variances in actual results from related estimates on a large project or on several smaller projects could be material to our results of operations. The full amount of an estimated loss on a contract is recognized in the period such a loss is identified. Such adjustments and accrued losses could reduce profitability, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets which have been subject to impairment. A decline in our reporting unit's estimated fair value or trade name intangible asset could result in additional asset impairment charges, which would be recorded as a non-cash expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\nGoodwill and our trade name and customer relationship intangible assets must be tested for impairment no less than annually. The fair value of the goodwill assigned to our reporting unit could decline if projected revenue or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to the timing of new awards or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets or goodwill exceeded its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a non-cash charge in the consolidated statement of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $62.2 million of goodwill and $53.5 million of our trade name and customer relationship intangibles on our balance sheet, which together represent 34% of our total assets. No impairment charges to our goodwill and intangible assets were identified during the year ended December 31, 2021. However, changes in our operations' future outlook could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock's market price may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include the various risks described in this section as well as the following:\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to continue to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u2022variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022internal control failures;\n\u2022changes in management;\n\u2022availability of capital;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022terrorist acts;\n\u2022natural disasters and pandemics;\n\u2022legislation;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022investor perception of us and the power generation industry.\nAdditional factors that do not specifically relate to our company or the electric utility industry may also materially reduce our common stock market price, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe concentration of our capital stock will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nBernhard Capital Partners Management, LP and its affiliates (\u201cBCP\u201d) beneficially own approximately 45% of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). The Preferred Stock is convertible at BCP's option at any time into shares of common stock. As a result, BCP can exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and most matters requiring our stockholders' actions. The interests of BCP may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also affect delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders, which could depress our common stock's market price.\nBCP and its respective affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable BCP to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that BCP and its respective affiliates (including portfolio investments of BCP and its affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022 permits BCP and its respective affiliates to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022 provides that if BCP or its respective affiliates, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of BCP or its respective affiliates, which is also one of our directors or officers, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nBCP or its respective affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, BCP and its respective affiliates may dispose of properties or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our business or prospects may be negatively affected if such parties procure attractive business opportunities for their benefit rather than for ours.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates, and we may do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions with affiliated companies in the past and may do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be as favorable as may be obtained with a third party.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Also, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022 after BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, providing that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum (before such time, vacancies may also be filled by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote);\n\u2022 after BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting any action by stockholders to be taken only at an annual meeting or special meeting rather than by written consent of the stockholders, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock concerning such rights;\n\u2022 after BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022 after BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, permitting special meetings of our stockholders to be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships (before such time, a special meeting may also be called at the request of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote);\n\u2022 after BCP and its affiliates no longer collectively hold more than 35% of the voting power of our common stock, requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of all then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to remove any or all of the directors from office at any time, and directors will be removable only for \u201ccause\u201d;\n\u2022 dividing our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022 providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt or alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that our stockholders may initiate, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees, agents, or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, employee, or agent of ours arising under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if our common stock price appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price higher than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that our common stock price will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price you paid for it.\nShares eligible for future sale may cause our common stock's market price to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nOur common stock market price could decline due to sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOn March 16, 2020, we issued $26.0 million in Preferred Stock to BCP, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nWe currently have 26,000 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, which is convertible at BCP's option at any time following the three-month anniversary of the issuance date into shares of common stock with an initial conversion price of $2.77 per share. Dividends will be payable quarterly at a rate of 13% per annum, provided that we pay dividends in-kind through the issuance of additional shares to BCP. Our Preferred Stock gives BCP a superior right to our assets upon liquidation compared to our common stock and could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, our preferred stock provides BCP the right to nominate one member of the Company's board of directors and the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences assigned to BCP could affect the common stock's residual value.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting and other generally applicable public company requirements. Under these reduced disclosure requirements, emerging growth companies are not required to, among other things, comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation, hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, or obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, emerging growth companies have extended phase-in periods to adopt new or revised financial accounting standards.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the extended phase-in periods for adopting new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such an election would be irrevocable under Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nOur election to use the longer phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the extended phase-in periods under Section 107 of the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur common stock's trading market is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company adversely changes their recommendation concerning our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to remediate the material weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nManagement identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with our assessment as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness, in the aggregate, relating to: (i) the lack of a sufficient number of trained resources with assigned responsibilities and accountability for the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting; (ii) the lack of formal and effective controls over certain financial statement account balances, (iii) the lack of user profiles to ensure adequate restriction of users to perform only transactions that are consistent with their function; and (iv) the lack of appropriate segregation of duties within the accounting and finance functions, including order to cash, process to pay and payroll business processes.\nAlthough we have begun to implement measures to address the material weakness, the implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weakness and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot conclude that these matters have been fully remedied. As we continue to evaluate, and work to improve, our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine that additional or different measures to address control deficiencies or modifications to the remediation plan are necessary. Further, in the future, we may determine that we have additional material weaknesses. Our failure to remediate the material weakness or failure to identify and address any other material weaknesses or control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which may result in volatility in and a decline in the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17916, "SIC": 4950, "TIC": "CHRA"}
