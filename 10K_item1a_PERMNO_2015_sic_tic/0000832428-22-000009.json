Risk Factors\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as ours, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. The most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected how we, our vendors and our customers are operating, and the extent to which this pandemic will impact our future results of operations and overall financial condition remains uncertain.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption in economies around the world. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our operations, financial results and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers, including advertisers, and their demand for our services; our ability to sell and provide our services, including as a result of travel restrictions and individuals working from home; the ability of our customers to pay for our services; and any closures of our offices and facilities or those of our vendors and our customers. Customers may also slow down decision making, delay planned advertising or seek to modify or terminate existing agreements with us.\nThe duration of the pandemic and the extent of the impact on us and others depend on future developments out of our control that are unknown at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of vaccination programs and containment actions, the pace of development of cures or vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on our business, employees, vendors and customers. Any of these factors could exacerbate other risks and uncertainties disclosed in this Form 10-K and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe expect to derive the majority of our revenues from advertising spending, which is affected by numerous factors. Declines in advertising revenues will adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nThe demand for advertising is sensitive to a number of factors, both locally and nationally, including the following:\n\u2022The advertising and marketing spending by customers can be subject to seasonal and cyclical variations and is likely to be adversely affected during economic downturns.\n\u2022Programming and content offered by our businesses may not achieve desired ratings or may decline in popularity with its audience.\n\u2022Audiences continue to fragment in recent years as the broad distribution of cable and satellite television and the growth in over-the-top streaming services have greatly increased the options available to the public for accessing audio and video programming, including live sports. Continued fragmentation of audiences, and the growth of internet programming and streaming services, could adversely impact advertising rates, which will reflect the size and demographics of the audience reached by advertisers through our media businesses.\n\u2022Television advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from political advertising, which is affected by campaign finance laws, as well as the competitiveness of specific political races in the markets where our television stations operate.\n\u2022Continued consolidation and contraction of local advertisers in our local markets could adversely impact our operating results, given that we expect the majority of our advertising to be sold to local businesses in our markets.\n\u2022Television stations have significant exposure to advertising in the automotive, retail and services industries. Our national networks have significant exposure to advertising in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and retail industries. Advertising within these industries may decline and we may not be able to secure replacement advertisers.\n\u2022Several national advertising agencies are employing an automated process known as \u201cprogrammatic buying\u201d to gain efficiencies and reduce costs related to buying advertising. Growth in advertising revenues will rely in part on the ability to maintain and expand relationships with existing and future advertisers. The implementation of a programmatic model or other similar solution, where automation replaces existing pricing and allocation methods, could turn advertising inventory into a price-driven commodity. These automated solutions could reduce the value of relationships with advertisers as well as result in downward pricing pressure.\nIf we are unable to respond to any or all of these factors, our advertising revenues could decline and affect our profitability.\nThe growth of direct content-to-consumer delivery channels may fragment our television audiences. This fragmentation could adversely impact advertising rates as well as cause a reduction in the revenues we receive from retransmission consent agreements, resulting in a loss of revenue that could materially adversely affect our broadcast operations.\nWe deliver our television programming to our audiences primarily over-the-air and through cable and satellite service providers. Our television audience is being fragmented by the digital delivery of content directly to the consumer audience. Content providers, such as the \"Big 4\" broadcast networks, cable networks such as HBO and Showtime, and new content developers, distributors and syndicators such as Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are now able to deliver their programming directly to consumers, over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) via the internet. The delivery of content directly to consumers allows them to bypass the programming we deliver, which may impact our audience size. Fragmentation of our audiences could impact the rates we receive from our advertisers. In addition, reduction in the number of subscribers to cable and satellite service providers could impact the revenue we receive under retransmission consent agreements. Widespread adoption of OTT by our audiences could result in a reduction of our advertising and retransmission revenues and affect our profitability.\nThe loss of affiliation and carriage agreements or the costs of renewals could adversely affect our operating results.\nEighteen of our stations have affiliations with the ABC television network, eleven with the NBC television network, nine with the CBS television network and four with the FOX television network. Additionally, we have affiliations with the CW television network. These television networks produce and distribute programming which our stations commit to air at specified times. Networks sell commercial advertising time during their programming, and the \"Big 4\" networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX, also require stations to pay fees for the right to carry their programming. These fees may be a percentage of retransmission revenues that the stations receive (see below) or may be fixed amounts based on the number of households or subscribers in a market. These fees have been increasing from renewal to renewal over the past several years.\nION's broadcast stations are carried by cable and satellite operators in their local television markets pursuant to the FCC\u2019s \u201cmust carry\u201d rules. Additionally, in certain of our markets, our national networks are carried by local television broadcasters\nand cable and satellite operators pursuant to negotiated carriage agreements. These contracts typically require us to make fixed fee payments and generally have three to five-year terms.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to reach network affiliation or carriage agreements in the future. The non-renewal or termination of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the respective network. Loss of a network affiliation would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may not be as attractive to target audiences and could result in lower advertising revenues. In addition, loss of any of the \"Big 4\" network affiliations would result in materially lower retransmission revenue. The loss of carriage agreements for our national networks would reduce our advertising revenues and affect our profitability.\nOur retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals of retransmission consent agreements, by declines in the number of subscribers to multichannel video programming distributor (\"MVPD\") services, by new technologies for the distribution of video programming, or by revised government regulations.\nAs our retransmission consent agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew them at comparable or better rates. As a result, retransmission revenues could decrease and retransmission revenue growth could decline over time.\nIn recent years, the number of subscribers to MVPD services has declined, as the growth of direct internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has incentivized consumers to discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. Decreases in the number of MVPD subscribers reduces the revenue we earn under our retransmission agreements.\nThe use of new technologies to redistribute broadcast programming, such as those that rely upon the Internet to deliver video programming or those that receive and record broadcast signals over the air via an antenna and then retransmit that information digitally to customers\u2019 television sets, specialty set-top boxes, or computer or mobile devices, could adversely affect our retransmission revenue if such technologies are not found to be subject to copyright or other legal restrictions or to regulations that apply to MVPDs such as cable operators or satellite carriers.\nChanges in the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d) or the FCC\u2019s rules with respect to the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements between broadcasters and MVPDs could also adversely impact our ability to negotiate acceptable retransmission consent agreements. In addition, continued consolidation among cable television operators could adversely impact our ability to negotiate acceptable retransmission consent agreements.\nThere are proceedings before the FCC and legislation has been proposed in Congress reexamining policies that now protect television stations' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. We cannot predict the outcome of these and other proceedings that challenge traditional means of redistributing broadcast programming or their possible impact on our operations.\nWe make investments in television programming (\"content\") in advance of knowing whether that particular content will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs. Additionally, if costs to acquire this content increase or this content becomes more difficult to obtain, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe incur significant costs for the purchase of television programming. We may have to purchase content several years in advance or enter into multi-year agreements, resulting in the commitment of significant costs in advance of knowing whether the content will be popular with its audience. If this acquired content is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we invest in the content, or if we need to replace content that is performing poorly, we may not be able to produce enough revenue to recover our costs. Additionally, increased competition for content from entrants into the market and the exclusive use of content on streaming services owned by content creators could reduce content availability or increase our content costs. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.\nOur television stations will continue to be subject to government regulations which, if revised, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022Pursuant to FCC rules, local television stations must elect every three years to either (1) require cable operators and/or direct broadcast satellite carriers to carry the stations\u2019 over-the-air signals or (2) enter into retransmission consent negotiations for carriage. If our retransmission consent agreements are terminated or not renewed, or if\nour broadcast signals are distributed on less-favorable terms, our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we cannot renew our FCC broadcast licenses, our broadcast operations will be impaired. Our business depends upon maintaining our broadcast licenses from the FCC, which has the authority to revoke licenses, not renew them, or renew them only with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term. We cannot assure that future renewal applications will be approved, or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect operations. If the FCC fails to renew any of these licenses, it could prevent us from operating the affected stations. If the FCC renews a license with substantial conditions or modifications (including renewing the license for a term of fewer than eight years), it could have a material adverse effect on the affected station\u2019s revenue potential.\n\u2022As also discussed under Federal Regulation of Broadcasting, the FCC has adopted broadcasters\u2019 proposal to permit the voluntary use of a new digital television transmission standard, ATSC 3.0, that is incompatible with the existing standard. Much uncertainty exists concerning the costs, benefits, and public acceptance of the services expected to become possible under this new standard, and television stations could be adversely affected by moving either too quickly or too slowly towards its adoption.\n\u2022The FCC and other government agencies are continually considering proposals intended to promote consumer interests. New government regulations affecting the television industry could raise programming costs, restrict broadcasters\u2019 operating flexibility, reduce advertising revenues, raise the costs of delivering broadcast signals, or otherwise affect operating results. We cannot predict the nature or scope of future government regulation or its impact on our operations.\nAcquisitions involve risks and, if said risks are not managed effectively, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nDuring 2019, we acquired 27 television stations through multiple transactions for total cash consideration of $1.2 billion and, on January 7, 2021, we acquired the ION national television network for a purchase price of $2.65 billion. Acquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures, facilities and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected if we are unable to implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies, or increase revenues as a result of these acquisitions. Acquisitions can result in unexpected liabilities and potentially divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nWe may evaluate strategic acquisitions in the future, and there are various risks associated with an acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued and may selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, subject to market conditions, our liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, with the goal of improving our business. We may not be able to identify other attractive acquisition targets or some of our competitors may have greater financial or managerial resources with which to pursue acquisition targets we may pursue. Therefore, even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, we may face considerable competition and be unsuccessful in acquiring such targets.\nAcquisitions of television stations are subject to the approval of the FCC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Current or future policies of these regulatory authorities could restrict our ability to pursue or consummate future transactions and could require us to divest certain television stations if an acquisition under contract would result in excessive concentration in a market or fail to comply with FCC ownership limitations. There can be no assurance that an acquisition will be approved by these regulatory authorities, or that a requirement to divest existing stations will not have an adverse effect on the transaction or our business.\nWe will continue to face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of operations, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\nSecurity breaches, malware or other \u201ccyber attacks\u201d could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services, jeopardizing our confidential information and that of our vendors and clients, and damaging our reputation. Our operations are routinely involved in receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information. Although we monitor security measures regularly, any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, theft of data, network disruption, denial of service, or similar act by any party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, and security of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors. These events, or our failure to employ new technologies, revise processes and invest in people to sustain our\nability to defend against cyber threats, could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to protect information, and adversely affect our revenue by causing the loss of current or potential clients.\nWe issued $600 million in preferred shares as part of our financing of the ION acquisition, the terms of which restrict us from undertaking certain actions while such preferred shares are outstanding.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire Hathaway\u201d) provided $600 million of financing for the ION acquisition in exchange for Series A Preferred Shares of the Company. The preferred shares are redeemable at the option of Scripps beginning on the fifth anniversary of issuance, and redeemable at the option of the holders in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the terms of the preferred shares), in each case at a redemption price of 105% of the face value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared). As long as Scripps pays quarterly dividends in cash on the preferred shares, the dividend rate will be 8% per annum. If dividends on the preferred shares, which compound quarterly, are not paid in full in cash, the rate will increase to 9% per annum for the rest of time that the preferred shares are outstanding. Under the terms of the preferred shares, Scripps is subject to certain restrictions, including being prohibited from paying dividends on and purchasing its common shares until all preferred shares are redeemed. While the preferred shares are outstanding, we may also not issue any additional preferred shares or any shares of any other series of preferred without the consent of Berkshire Hathaway. These restrictions may limit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Scripps Class A Common Shares\nCertain descendants of Edward W. Scripps own approximately 91% of Scripps' Common Voting shares and are signatories to the Scripps Family Agreement, which governs the transfer and voting of Common Voting shares held by them.\nAs a result of the foregoing, these descendants have the ability to elect two-thirds of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter on which the Ohio Revised Code (\u201cORC\u201d) does not require a vote of our Class A Common shares. Under our articles of incorporation, holders of Class A Common shares vote only for the election of one-third of the Board of Directors and are not entitled to vote on any matter other than a limited number of matters expressly set forth in the ORC as requiring a separate vote of both classes of stock. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, the market price of our Class A Common shares could be adversely affected.\nWe have the ability to issue preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our Class A Common shares.\nOur articles of incorporation allow the Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of 25 million shares of preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend, liquidation and other rights of holders of our Class A Common shares.\nThe public price and trading volume of our Class A Common shares may be volatile.\nThe price and trading volume of our Class A Common shares may be volatile and subject to fluctuation. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of Class A Common shares include:\n\u2022major world events;\n\u2022general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry, the national media marketplace and the financial markets generally;\n\u2022the political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u2022variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022inability to meet revenue forecasts;\n\u2022announcements by us or competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;\n\u2022adoption of new accounting standards affecting the media industry;\n\u2022operations of competitors and the performance of competitors\u2019 common stock;\n\u2022litigation and governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022loss of key personnel;\n\u2022purchases or sales of blocks of our Class A Common shares;\n\u2022operating and stock performance of companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us; and\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment, including rulemaking or other actions by the FCC.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our Class A Common shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our Class A Common shares, regardless of the Company\u2019s operating performance. Stock price volatility might be higher if the trading volume of our Class A Common shares is low. Furthermore, shareholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our Class A Common shares declines significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.21 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, approximately $963 million of which constituted senior unsecured debt, $550 million of which constituted senior secured debt and $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of term loans under our Credit Agreement. We have the ability to incur up to $400 million of indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, all of which is secured indebtedness, effectively ranking senior to unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.\nOur outstanding debt could have the following consequences:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\nOur ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Agreement or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making\nloans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations under the respective agreements, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the indenture that governs senior indebtedness and the agreements governing our Credit Agreement, include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions, subject to certain limitations, on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022issue guarantees;\n\u2022merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so will result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial covenants under our Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable senior credit facility. Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debt holders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under such senior credit facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates may increase in the future. If rates were to increase, debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our obligations would decrease. Additionally, upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, the interest rates on our existing term loans would increase.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out LIBOR over the next couple of years. While LIBOR will no longer be used to price new loans starting in 2022, the index will formally exist until at least 2023. The United States has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the suggested replacement for LIBOR and that the phase-out from LIBOR to SOFR will be June 30, 2023. Further, our Credit Agreement has replacement rate language in place that will provide for transition to the new SOFR benchmark. The utilization of SOFR may produce higher rates than those\nthat would have been in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out which could negatively impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 84176, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "SSP"}
