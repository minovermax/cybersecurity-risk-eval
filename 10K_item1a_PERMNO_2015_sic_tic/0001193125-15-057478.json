Risk factors\nRisks relating to the Merger Transaction\nOn January 25, 2015, the company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the \u201cCombination Agreement,\u201d and the transactions contemplated thereby, collectively, the \u201cCombination Transaction\u201d, \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d or \u201cMerger Transaction\u201d) with Rock-Tenn to create a leading global provider of consumer and corrugated packaging. In the Combination Agreement, MWV and Rock-Tenn have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Combination Agreement, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses by: (i) Rock-Tenn forming a new holding company organized under the laws of Delaware, the name of which will be mutually agreed upon by Rock-Tenn and MWV (\u201cTopCo\u201d), (ii) Rock-Tenn merging with a newly formed wholly owned direct subsidiary of TopCo, with Rock-Tenn surviving such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of TopCo (the \u201cRock-Tenn Merger\u201d), and (iii) MWV merging with and into a newly formed wholly owned direct subsidiary of TopCo, with such subsidiary surviving such merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of TopCo (the \u201cMWV Merger\u201d and, together with the Rock-Tenn Merger, the \u201cMergers\u201d). Refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, for further details regarding the above transaction.\nFailure to complete the proposed Combination Transaction could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and the market price of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that the closing of the proposed Combination Transaction will occur. Consummation of the Combination Transaction is subject to various conditions, including the adoption of the Combination Agreement by the stockholders of MWV and the shareholders of Rock-Tenn, the receipt of certain domestic and foreign governmental approvals, the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Mergers and certain other conditions. The company cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of these conditions will be satisfied. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of the Board of Directors of MWV or Rock-Tenn or a termination of the Combination Agreement by MWV or Rock-Tenn\nto enter into a binding agreement providing for a superior alternative transaction. If the Combination Transaction is not consummated, and there are no other parties willing and able to enter into an alternative transaction with the company on terms acceptable to MWV, our stock price will likely decline as our stock has recently traded at prices based on the announcement of the proposed Business Combination. A failed transaction may also result in negative publicity and a negative impression of the company in the investment community. If the Combination Agreement is not adopted by our stockholders and the Rock-Tenn shareholders, or if the Mergers are not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely affected. Upon termination of the Combination Agreement by us or Rock-Tenn under specified conditions, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $230 million to Rock-Tenn, or our remedy may be limited to receipt of a termination fee of $230 million from Rock-Tenn, and under some circumstances, we would not be entitled to receive any termination fee. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s results of operations and stock price.\nWe will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger Transaction.\nThe company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Business Combination, as well as the direction of management resources towards the Business Combination. We expect to incur additional costs associated with completing the Business Combination and combining the operations of the company and Rock-Tenn. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the future.\nMWV will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the combination transaction is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the combination on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on MWV and consequently on the combined company. These uncertainties may impair each party\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the combination is completed, and could cause suppliers, customers and others that deal with the parties to seek to change existing business relationships with them. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the combination, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the combined company\u2019s business following the combination could be negatively impacted. In addition, the combination agreement restricts each of MWV and Rock-Tenn from making certain acquisitions and expenditures, entering into certain contracts, and taking other specified actions until the mergers occurs without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent MWV from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the combination.\nPutative stockholder class actions challenging the Business Combination have been filed, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in any of these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the Business Combination and result in substantial costs.\nPutative class actions challenging the Business Combination have been filed on behalf of the company\u2019s stockholders. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Business Combination from proceeding. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. Moreover, additional lawsuits related to the Business Combination may be filed against us, Rock-Tenn, and our affiliates and directors. These lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of Business Combination and/or result in substantial costs to us, including any costs associated with the indemnification of our directors. The company believes these actions are without merit.\nRisks relating to our business\nOn January 8, 2015, the company announced approval of a plan to fully separate the Specialty Chemicals business. The separation is expected to be executed by means of a tax-free spinoff of the Specialty Chemicals business to MWV shareholders, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and is subject to a legal opinion on the tax-free nature of the transaction. Failure to complete the transaction could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nIf the transaction is not completed for any reason, the price of MWV common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of MWV common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the transaction will be completed and the related benefits realized. The company may also be subject to additional risks if the transaction is not completed including potential disruption to the company\u2019s Specialty Chemicals business and the distraction of its workforce and management team.\nU.S. and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.\nConsumer and business confidence, the availability and cost of credit, consumer spending and business investment, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our products would be adversely affected. Adverse developments in the U.S., Europe or emerging markets, including Brazil and China, could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, and bankruptcy of customers or other related parties. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In a challenging and uncertain economic environment, we cannot predict whether or when such adverse economic circumstances may occur, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial position.\nThe company has announced a margin improvement program. If we fail to execute fully on this initiative, we may not realize all the improvements we have publicly announced.\nIn January of 2014, the company announced a program to generate increased earnings and cash flow. As of December 31, 2014, the company realized $85 million in savings. The program is expected to deliver total cumulative pre-tax cost savings of approximately $135 million by the end of 2015. Management is committed to achieving these goals and believes they are attainable. The company\u2019s degree of success in attaining these objectives will affect its operating earnings and cash flow.\nThe company\u2019s businesses are subject to significant cost pressures. Pricing volatility and our ability to pass higher costs on to our customers through price increases or other adjustments is uncertain and dependent on market conditions and may materially impact our results of operations.\nThe pricing environment for raw materials used in a number of our businesses can fluctuate. The company sources all wood fiber for its U.S. mills from third parties. Additionally, energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable. Further unpredictable increases in the cost of various essential materials, energy or freight may materially impact our results of operations. Depending on market forces and the terms of customer contracts, our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited.\nThe company faces intense competition in each of its businesses, and competitive challenges from lower cost manufacturers. If we cannot successfully compete in an increasingly global market place, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe company operates in competitive domestic and international markets and competes with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers, both domestically and on a global basis. The company\u2019s businesses are facing competition from lower cost manufacturers in Asia and elsewhere. All of these conditions can contribute to substantial pricing and demand pressures, which could adversely affect the company\u2019s operating results.\nA key component of the company\u2019s competitive position is MeadWestvaco\u2019s ability to both innovate and manage expenses successfully. This requires continuous management focus on producing new and innovative products and solutions and reducing costs and improving efficiency through cost controls, productivity enhancements and regular appraisal of our asset portfolio.\nThe company\u2019s markets are global. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business, by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other factors related to our international sales and operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, sales outside the U.S. were approximately 52% of total sales, which includes 19% of export sales to our foreign customers. We completed a substantial expansion of our corrugated packaging operations in Brazil as well as expanded our participation in other emerging markets, including China and India. As our international operations and activities expand, we inevitably have greater exposure to the risks of operating in many foreign countries. These factors include:\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices and manufacturing costs, and therefore the demand for our products in a particular market.\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including government subsidies, tax benefits, trade actions (such as anti-dumping proceedings) and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over the company.\n\u2022\nChanges generally in political, regulatory or economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business.\n\u2022\nCommercial and regulatory difficulties in markets where corrupt practices are frequently encountered.\nThese risks could affect the cost of manufacturing and selling our products, our pricing, sales volume, and ultimately our financial performance. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on the company vary from country to country and are unpredictable.\nThe company is subject to extensive regulation under various environmental laws and regulations, and is involved in various legal proceedings related to the environment. Environmental regulation and legal proceedings have the potential for involving significant costs and liability for the company.\nThe company\u2019s operations are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental laws and regulations. The company has been focused for some time on improving energy efficiency which also reduces its emissions of carbon dioxide. In recent years, acting unilaterally, the company has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels even as overall production has increased.\nWe report the direct greenhouse gas emissions for our major U.S. manufacturing facilities to the U.S. EPA which are publicly available on the EPA website, www.epa.gov, we also report the consolidated greenhouse gas emissions from all of our manufacturing facilities worldwide to the Carbon Disclosure Project (\u201cCDP\u201d).\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced, proposed or finalized numerous air emission regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions, new emission standards for industrial boilers and establishment of more stringent ambient air quality standards. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, could subject the company to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses in future years. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes.\nThe company is also subject to various environmental proceedings and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. In the case of known potential liabilities, it is management\u2019s judgment that the resolution of pending litigation and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period or periods, however, it is possible such proceedings or matters could have a material effect on the results of operations. The company could also be subject to new environmental proceedings which could cause the company to incur substantial additional costs with resulting impact on results of operations.\nMaterial disruptions at one of our major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe take appropriate measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material operational disruption in one of our major facilities could negatively impact production and our financial results. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to a major equipment failure, labor stoppages, inadequate supply of fiber, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials, severe weather conditions and disruptions in utility services.\nThe real estate industry is highly competitive and economically cyclical.\nThe company engages in value-added real estate development activities in the Charleston, South Carolina region, including obtaining entitlements and establishing joint ventures and other development-related arrangements. Our ability to execute our plans to realize the greater value associated with our development land holdings may be affected by the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions, including credit markets and interest rates.\n\u2022\nLocal real estate market conditions, including competition from sellers of land and real estate developers.\n\u2022\nImpact of federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting land use, land use entitlements, land protection and zoning.", "PERMNO": 21186, "SIC": 2631, "TIC": "MWV"}
