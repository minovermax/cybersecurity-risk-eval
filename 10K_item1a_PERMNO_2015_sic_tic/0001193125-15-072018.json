{"cik": "883237", "company": "VIRTUS INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section describes some of the potential risks relating to our business, such as market, liquidity, operational, reputation and regulatory. The risks described below are some of the more important factors that could affect our business. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating the Company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occur our business, revenues, profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nWe earn substantially all of our revenues based on assets under management, and therefore a reduction in assets under management would reduce our revenues and profitability. Assets under management fluctuate based on many factors including market conditions, investment performance and client withdrawals.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated from asset-based fees from investment management products and services to individuals and institutions. Therefore, if the assets under management decline, our fee revenues decline reducing profitability as some of our expenses are fixed. There are several reasons that assets under management could decline as discussed below:\n\u2022\nThe value of assets under management can decline due to price declines in specific securities or in specific market segments or geographic areas where those assets are invested. Funds and portfolios that we manage related to certain geographic markets and industry sectors are particularly vulnerable to political, social and economic events in those markets and sectors. If these industries or markets decline or experience volatility, this could have a negative impact on our assets under management and our revenues. For example, certain non-U.S. markets, particularly emerging markets, are not as developed or as efficient as the U.S. financial markets and, as a result, may be less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. financial markets. Liquidity in such markets may be adversely impacted by political or economic events, government policies, expropriation, volume trading limits by foreign investors and social or civil unrest. These factors may negatively impact our ability to dispose of an investment and its market value. In addition, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies could result in a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of assets under management that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies.\n\u2022\nThe performance of our investment strategies is critical to the maintenance and growth of assets under management. Net flows related to our investment strategies can be affected by investment performance relative to other competing investment strategies or to established benchmarks. Investment management strategies are rated, ranked or assessed by independent third-parties, distribution partners, and industry periodicals and services. These assessments often influence the investment decisions of our clients. If the performance or assessment of our investment strategies is seen as underperforming relative to peers, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets by existing clients and the inability to attract additional investments from existing and new clients. In addition, certain of our investment strategies have capacity constraints, as there is a limit to the number of securities available for the strategy to operate effectively. In those instances, we may choose to limit access to new or existing investors.\n\u2022\nGeneral domestic and global economic and political conditions throughout the world can influence assets under management. Changes in interest rates, the availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations) and other conditions may impact the equity and credit markets which may influence our assets under management. In recent years, capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility. While there has been some recovery in the capital markets since then, high unemployment rates in the United States and elsewhere, a sluggish recovery in some real estate markets, continued economic weakness in the Eurozone, increased austerity measures by several European governments, uncertainty about the future of the euro, escalating regional turmoil in the\nMiddle East, concern over growth prospects in China and emerging markets, growing debt loads for certain countries and uncertainty about the consequences of governments eventually withdrawing monetary stimulus all indicate that economic and political conditions remain unpredictable. If the security markets decline or experience volatility, our assets under management and our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the volatility in the markets in the recent past has highlighted the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrated how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially adversely impact the performance of other institutions. Our assets under management have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk due to the default by a counterparty or client or in the event of a market failure or disruption or otherwise. In the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties, we may suffer significant declines in assets under management and severe liquidity or valuation issues.\nMoreover, a significant amount of our assets under management are in investments represented by strategies that primarily invest in securities in non-U.S. companies. Many non-U.S. financial markets are not as developed or as efficient as the U.S. financial markets and, as a result, have limited liquidity and greater price volatility and may lack established regulations. Liquidity in such markets also may be adversely impacted by political or economic events, government policies, expropriation, volume trading limits by foreign investors and social and civil unrest. An investment\u2019s market value or the ability to dispose of an investment may be adversely impacted by any of these factors. Governments of foreign jurisdictions may assert their abilities to tax local gains and/or income of foreign investors, including our clients, which could adversely impact the economics associated with investing in foreign jurisdictions or non-U.S. based companies. These risks also could impact the performance of our strategies that invest in such markets and, in particular, strategies that concentrate investments in emerging market companies and countries.\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates can have adverse effects on our assets under management. Increases in interest rates from their historically low present levels may adversely affect the net asset values of our assets under management. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could lead to outflows in fixed income assets that we manage as investors seek higher yields. Any of these effects could lower our assets under management and revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, would lead to a reduction in our net income.\nAny of these factors could cause our assets under management to decline and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment advisory agreements are subject to withdrawal, renegotiation or termination on short notice.\nOur clients include the boards of directors for our sponsored mutual funds, managed account program sponsors, private clients and institutional clients. Our investment management agreements with these clients may be terminated upon short notice without penalty. As a result, there would be little impediment to these sponsors or clients terminating our agreements. Our clients may terminate or renegotiate their investment contracts with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with us due to a number of reasons including investment performance, reputational, regulatory or compliance issues, loss of key investment management or other personnel or a change in management or control of clients, third-party distributors, subadvisers or others with whom we have relationships. The directors of our sponsored funds may deem it to be in the best interests of a fund\u2019s shareholders to make decisions adverse to us, such as reducing the compensation paid to us, requesting that we subsidize fund expenses over certain thresholds, or imposing restrictions on our management of the fund. Under the Investment Company Act, investment advisory agreements automatically terminate in the event of an\nassignment, which may occur if, among other events, the Company undergoes a change in control, such as any person acquiring 25% voting rights of our common stock. If an assignment were to occur, we could continue to act as adviser to a fund only if that fund\u2019s board of directors and its stockholders approved a new investment advisory agreement. In addition, investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client. If an assignment occurs, we cannot be certain that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary fund approvals or the necessary consents from our clients. The withdrawal, renegotiation or termination of any investment management contract relating to a material portion of assets under management would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a reduction in our revenues and profitability.\nMaintaining a strong reputation with the investment community is critical to our success. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate even if they are without merit or satisfactorily addressed. Our reputation may be impacted by many factors, including but not limited to: poor performance; litigation; conflicts of interests; regulatory inquiries, investigations or findings; intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products or services; or employee misconduct or rumors. Any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, adversely impact relationships with third-party distributors and other business partners and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage client assets under agreements that have established investment guidelines or other contractual requirements, and any failure to comply could result in claims, losses or regulatory sanctions, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nThe agreements under which we manage client assets often have established investment guidelines or other contractual requirements that we are required to comply with in providing our investment management services. Although we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent, detect, and correct such errors, any failure or allegation of a failure to comply with these guidelines or other requirement could result in client claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business relies on the ability to attract and retain key employees, and the loss of such employees could negatively affect financial performance.\nThe success of our business is dependent to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain key employees such as senior executives, portfolio managers, securities analysts and sales personnel. Competition in the job market for these professionals is generally intense and compensation levels in the industry are highly competitive. The market for investment managers is also characterized by the movement of investment managers among different firms.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain key employees, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees increase, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we utilize equity awards as part of our compensation philosophy and as a means for recruiting and retaining key employees. Declines in our stock price could result in deterioration in the value of equity awards granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of retaining key employees through stock-based awards.\nIn certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain assets under management, or the loss of certain client accounts. Any inability to retain our key employees, attract qualified employees, or replace key employee positions in a timely manner, could lead to a reduction in the\namount of our assets under management, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, there could be additional costs to replace, retain or attract new talent which would result in a decrease in our profitability and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe highly competitive nature of the asset management industry may force us to reduce the fees we charge to our clients, increase amounts paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries, all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.\nWe face significant competition from a wide variety of financial institutions, including other investment management companies, as well as from proprietary products offered by our distribution partners such as banks, broker-dealers and financial planning firms. Competition in our businesses is based on several factors including investment performance, access to distribution channels, service to financial advisers and their clients and fees charged. Our competitors, many of which are larger than we are, often offer similar products, use similar distribution sources, offer less expensive products, have greater access to key distribution channels and have greater resources, geographic footprints and name recognition than we do.\nIn addition, our profits are highly dependent on the fee levels for our products and services. In recent years, there has been a trend in certain segments of our markets toward lower fees. Competition could cause us to reduce the fees that we charge for products and services. In order to maintain appropriate fee levels in a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment products and services that are viewed as appropriate in relation to the fees charged. If our clients, including our fund boards, were to view our fees as being high relative to the market or the returns provided by our investment products, we may choose to reduce our fee levels or we may experience significant redemptions in our assets under management, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to an extensive and complex regulatory environment, and changes in regulations or failure to comply with regulation could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe investment management industry in which we operate is subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation. We are regulated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, and we are subject to regulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission under the Commodities Exchange Act. Our Global Fund is subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland. We are also regulated by FINRA, the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), as well as other federal and state laws and regulations.\nAlthough we spend extensive time and resources on compliance efforts designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, if we or our affiliates fail to timely and properly modify and update our compliance procedures in this changing and highly complex regulatory environment, we may be subject to various legal proceedings, including civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement actions and result in fines, penalties or suspensions of individual employees or limitations on particular business activities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets in the U.S., and any limitations on our tax attributes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the appropriateness of our tax positions and reporting. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable. In addition, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes available to us will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income.\nA large portion of our deferred tax assets is related to the application of a particular Internal Revenue Code section. We received a private letter ruling that relies on certain facts, assumptions and representations from management regarding the past conduct of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions or representations are determined to be incorrect, we may not be able to rely on the ruling and could be subject to significant tax liabilities in the event we utilize the related deferred tax assets.\nWe utilize unaffiliated firms in providing investment management services and any matters that have an adverse impact to their business, or any change in our relationships with these unaffiliated firms could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which will adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe utilize select unaffiliated subadvisers as investment managers on certain mutual funds and variable insurance funds we offer. In addition, certain of our affiliated managers have licensing arrangements with unaffiliated data providers. Because we typically have no ownership interests in these unaffiliated firms, we do not control the business activities of such firms. Problems stemming from the business activities of these unaffiliated firms may negatively impact or disrupt such firms\u2019 operations or expose them to disciplinary action or reputational harm. Furthermore, any such problems at these unaffiliated firms may have an adverse impact on our business or reputation or expose us to regulatory scrutiny, including with respect to our oversight of such firms. For example, in December 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a settlement with F-Squared Investments, one of our unaffiliated subadvisers, which settled charges that F-Squared had violated the federal securities laws in connection with its false performance advertising as well as aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violate Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information related to the impact of developments at F-Squared on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and we cannot provide assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or the unaffiliated firms. These relationships can also be terminated upon short notice without penalty. An interruption or termination of our unaffiliated firm relationships could affect our ability to market our products and result in a reduction in assets under management, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe distribute through intermediaries, and changes in key distribution relationships could reduce our revenues, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur primary source of distribution for our retail products is through intermediaries that include third party financial intermediaries, such as: major wire houses; national, regional and independent broker-dealers and financial advisors; banks and financial planners and registered investment advisors. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution systems. These distributors are generally not contractually required to distribute our products and typically offer their clients various investment products and services, including proprietary products and services, in addition to and in competition with our products and services. While we compensate these distributors for selling our products and services pursuant to agreed amounts, we may not be able to retain access to these channels at all or at similar pricing. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and profitability. To the extent that existing or future intermediaries prefer to do business with our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and profitability could decline.\nWe and our third-party service providers, which includes securities pricing and transaction processing services, rely on numerous technology systems, and a temporary business interruption or security breach could negatively impact our business and profitability. Our business will suffer if our technology systems fail or are interrupted or if security breaches or other disruptions compromise our information.\nOur technology systems and those of our third-party service providers are critical to our operations. The ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information, process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success. Any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing such transactions or such reports, other breaches and errors, and any inadequacies in other customer service, could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities, or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us. Our customer service capability, as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports, is highly dependent on our third-party service providers\u2019 information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, whether resulting from technology or infrastructure breakdowns, defects or external causes such as fire, natural disaster, viruses, acts of terrorism or power disruptions, could result in financial loss, negatively impact our reputation, and negatively affect our ability to do business. Although we have in place disaster recovery plans, we may experience temporary interruptions if a natural disaster or prolonged power outages were to occur which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, like other companies in the financial services industry, our computer systems are regularly subject to and are expected to continue to be the target of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach of cyber security. Over time, however, the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and any controls we put in place and preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. Breach of our technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business through cyber-attacks, or failure to manage and secure our technology environment, could result in interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of our business, loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by a breach, additional costs to mitigate against future incidents and litigation costs resulting from an incident.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information as well as non-public business information. Although we and our third-party vendors take precautions, we may still be vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use. A breach of the systems or hardware could result in an unauthorized access to our proprietary business or client data or release of this type of data, which could subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws which may result in fines or penalties, the termination of existing client contracts, costly mitigation activities and harm to our reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOwnership of a relatively large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and dramatically affect our share price.\nA large percentage of our common stock is held by a limited number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders decide to liquidate their positions, it could cause significant fluctuation in the share price of our common stock. Public companies with a relatively concentrated level of institutional shareholders, such as we have, often have difficulty generating trading volume in their stock.\nCivil litigation and government investigations or proceedings could adversely affect our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and there have been substantial incidences of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. From time to time, we and/or our funds may be named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits or be involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits seeking substantial damages. We and/or our funds are also involved from time to time in governmental\nand self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings. Any of these lawsuits, investigations or proceedings could result in reputational damage, loss of clients and assets, settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties, increased costs and expenses in resolving a claim, diversion of employee resources and resulting financial losses. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants or by a large number of claimants, when claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular period, depending on our results for that period, or could cause us significant reputational harm, which could harm our business prospects.\nWe depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain clients. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants, including investors in our funds, or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the asset management industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses. We may incur substantial legal expenses in defending against proceedings commenced by a client, regulatory authority or other private litigant. Substantial legal liability levied on us could cause significant reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant portion of our assets invested in marketable securities that are primarily comprised of our seed capital program.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had $238.1 million of seed capital investments. A decline in the value of equity, fixed income and alternative securities could lower the value of these investments and result in declines in our non-operating income and net income. In addition, increases or decreases in the value of these investments will increase the volatility of our earnings.\nWe cannot assure you that our intended quarterly distributions will be paid each quarter or at all.\nThe declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividend, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, who may change our dividend policy at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividend, our Board of Directors considers general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our businesses and investment opportunities, our financial condition and\noperating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax, regulatory and other restrictions that may have implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We cannot assure you that any distributions, whether quarterly or otherwise, will be paid.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to meet the future cash needs of the Company is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although the Company has been successful in generating sufficient cash in the past, it may not be successful in generating additional cash in the future. As of December 31, 2014, we maintained a strong cash and working capital position and had no debt outstanding, however, we may need to raise capital to fund new business initiatives and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to access capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have corporate governance provisions that may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
