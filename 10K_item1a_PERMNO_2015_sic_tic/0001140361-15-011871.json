Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from what we projected. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business or financial position.\nPlease also see the \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2.\nRisks Related to Our Limited Sources of Revenue\nThe acquisition of Auxilium by Endo International plc may affect our future working relationship with Auxilium and future option, milestone and contingent royalty payments from Auxilium and future acquisitions by Endo of other companies may divert attention and resources from XIAFLEX.\nOn January 29, 2015, Endo acquired Auxilium and Auxilium became a wholly owned subsidiary of Endo. Our business is primary dependent upon our relationship with Auxilium. While integration planning has commenced, it is unclear what effect the acquisition of Auxilium will have on the Company\u2019s working relationship with Auxilium or certain matters pending between the Company and Auxilium including, but not limited to, the approval by Auxilium of the Company conducting certain clinical trials or the on-going audit by the Company of the royalties paid by Auxilium. The integration could cause disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business given the large number of Auxilium personnel, including members of the JDC, who are expected to depart Auxilium. Moreover, it is unclear what effect the acquisition or future acquisitions of other companies will have on the support for the products currently being developed and marketed by Auxilium that generate milestone payments and royalties for the Company, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Endo, as Auxilium\u2019s parent, may decide to allocate its resources other than to the development of XIAFLEX, and we have no control over that decision.\nEndo has disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015, additional risk factors related to its transaction with Auxilium. As such, we refer you to those risk factors under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Transaction with Auxilium\u201d in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of Endo\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future revenue is dependent upon option, milestone and contingent royalty payments from Auxilium.\nOur primary sources of revenues are from option, milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and contingent royalty payments from Auxilium under the Auxilium Agreement. As described in Item 1 above, under the Auxilium Agreement, in exchange for the right to receive royalties and other payments, we granted to Auxilium the right to develop, manufacture, market and sell worldwide products (other than dermal formulations for topical administration) that contain collagenase for the treatment of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, Peyronie\u2019s disease, frozen shoulder, cellulite and canine lipoma. However, we have no control over Auxilium\u2019s ability to successfully market, sell and manufacture candidate products for the treatment of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture and Peyronie\u2019s disease, or, in the case of frozen shoulder, cellulite and canine lipoma, to pursue commercialization, and we may receive limited, if any, royalty payments from Auxilium. We have received in the past, and are entitled to receive in the future, certain milestone payments from Auxilium in respect of its efforts to commercialize candidate products, but we have no control over Auxilium\u2019s ability to achieve the milestones. As also described in Item 1 above, Auxilium has sublicensed to third parties some of the development and commercialization rights it licenses from us. We have received in the past a percentage of sublicense income that Auxilium receives from these third parties based on the achievement of certain regulatory and sales related milestones. There is no guarantee that these third parties will continue to pursue development and commercialization of XIAFLEX (or XIAPEX in the EU). If any third party stops pursuing such development and commercialization, sublicense income would no longer be payable to Auxilium or us.\nEven if Auxilium or its sublicensees pursues development and commercialization, there is no guarantee that the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory body will approve XIAFLEX for a given indication or that commercialization will be successful, if the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory body does approve XIAFLEX for a given indication. Moreover, under the Auxilium Agreement, royalty payments are subject to set-off for certain expenses we owe Auxilium related to development and patent costs. We anticipate that the amount of royalties due to us will exceed the amount of any set-offs on a going forward basis.\nIn addition, we have granted to Auxilium an option to expand its license and development rights to one or more additional indications for injectable collagenase not currently licensed to Auxilium, including for the treatment of human lipoma. If Auxilium exercises its option with respect to an additional indication, we are entitled to receive a one-time license fee for the rights to, as well as potential milestone, royalty and other payments with respect to, such new indication. If Auxilium does not exercise its option as to any additional indication, we may offer to any third party such development rights with regard to products in the Auxilium Territory (as defined in the Auxilium Agreement), provided that we first offer the same terms to Auxilium, or develop the product ourselves. Auxilium has no obligation to exercise its option with respect to any such additional indication, and its decision to do so is in its complete discretion. Clinical trials can be expensive and the results are subject to different interpretations, therefore, there is no assurance that after conducting phase II clinical trials on any additional indication, and incurring the associated expenses, Auxilium will exercise its option or we will receive any revenue from it. Under the Auxilium Agreement, we may only offer to a third party development rights with regard to products in the Auxilium Territory and not in Europe and certain Eurasian countries. Even if Auxilium exercises its option as to any additional indication, its obligations to develop the product for such indication are limited to initiating Stage II Development (as defined in the Auxilium Agreement) for such additional indication within one year of exercising the option as to such indication.\nOur dependence upon revenue from Auxilium make us subject to the commercialization and other risk factors affecting Auxilium over which we have limited or no control.\nWe are dependent upon revenue from Auxilium and Auxilium\u2019s operating success or failure has a significant impact on our potential royalty stream and other payment rights. Risks effecting Auxilium and, consequently us, include the following:\nIf physicians do not prescribe XIAFLEX or the medical profession or patients do not accept XIAFLEX, our ability to grow or maintain revenues will be limited.\nOur revenues are dependent on market acceptance of XIAFLEX. physician willingness to prescribe, and patients\u2019 willingness to accept, XIAFLEX depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 perceived safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 incidence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use;\n\u00b7 availability of alternative treatments or products;\n\u00b7 cost effectiveness and pricing;\n\u00b7 the adequacy and effectiveness of Auxilium\u2019s sales force and that of any co- partner\u2019s sales force;\n\u00b7 the adequacy and effectiveness of Auxilium\u2019s production, distribution and marketing capabilities and those of Auxilium\u2019s international partners;\n\u00b7 publicity concerning Auxilium\u2019s products or competing products; and\n\u00b7 existence and level of third-party or government coverage or reimbursement for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture and Peyronie\u2019s disease.\nEven though there is regulatory approval for XIAFLEX, physicians may not prescribe, and patients may not accept, XIAFLEX if Auxilium or its partners do not promote it effectively. If XIAFLEX fails to achieve market acceptance, Auxilium may not be able to market and sell XIAFLEX successfully, which would limit our ability to receive revenue and could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for XIAFLEX, which could significantly harm our business.\nSome jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., may designate drugs intended to treat relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA granted orphan drug status to XIAFLEX in the U.S. for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation may not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and, in the U.S., specific tax credits. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that another application to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved, except in limited circumstances, for a period of up to 10 years in Europe and for a period of seven years in the U.S. Maintaining orphan drug designations and orphan drug exclusivity for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease may be critical to their success. Even with orphan drug exclusivity, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product is shown to be different or clinically superior, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product.\nIf third-party or government payors do not adequately reimburse customers for XIAFLEX, XIAFLEX might not be used or purchased, and our royalty revenue will not grow and may even decrease.\nOur revenues depend heavily upon the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement for the use of XIAFLEX from third-party healthcare and state and federal government payors, both in the U.S. and in foreign markets. Demand for XIAFLEX is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse Auxilium, or its partner\u2019s, customers for patients\u2019 medical expenses in the countries where Auxilium or its partners do business. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that XIAFLEX is:\n\u00b7 competitively priced;\n\u00b7 safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective;\n\u00b7 in alignment with the product\u2019s label; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nSince reimbursement approval for XIAFLEX is required from third-party and government payors, seeking this approval, particularly when seeking approval for a preferred form of reimbursement over other competitive products, is a time-consuming and costly process. Third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data from Auxilium in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness XIAFLEX and, in Europe, third-party payors consider competing therapies. For any individual third-party payor, Auxilium may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain reimbursement on a basis similar or preferred to competitive products or at all. If reimbursement is approved, it may be at prices below that which Auxilium believes to be appropriate. Once reimbursement at an agreed level is approved by a third-party payor, Auxilium may lose that reimbursement entirely or Auxilium may lose the similar or better reimbursement Auxilium receives compared to competitive products. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from pharmaceutical products and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursements for pharmaceutical technologies and procedures. As reimbursement is often approved for a period of time, this risk is greater at the end of the time period, if any, for which the reimbursement was approved. These trends could compel Auxilium to reduce prices for XIAFLEX could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, physicians may perceive the reimbursement levels associated with XIAFLEX to be inadequate, which could affect the use of such codes by physicians and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInternational commercialization of XIAFLEX face significant obstacles.\nAuxilium may commercialize XIAFLEX internationally on Auxilium\u2019s own or through collaborative relationships with Sobi, Asahi or Actelion or other foreign partners. Auxilium\u2019s foreign regulatory, clinical and commercial resources are limited, and accordingly, Auxilium\u2019s ability to expand XIAFLEX outside of the U.S. on Auxilium\u2019s own is limited. Auxilium may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements with appropriate partners for important foreign markets on acceptable terms, or at all. Future and current collaborations with foreign partners may not be effective or profitable and any international commercialization may carry risks due to Auxilium\u2019s limited international resources.\nAuxilium is dependent upon Auxilium\u2019s collaborative relationships with third parties to further develop and commercialize XIAFLEX (or XIAPEX as it is known in the EU) outside of the U.S. There may be circumstances that delay or prevent any of these third parties\u2019 ability to develop and commercialize XIAFLEX.\nAuxilium has entered into agreements with each of Sobi, Asahi and Actelion under which Auxilium has granted them the right to develop and commercialize XIAFLEX/XIAPEX in 71 Eurasian and African countries, in Japan, and in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Mexico, respectively. In addition, Auxilium may seek to enter into similar arrangements with other third parties with respect to the development and commercialization of XIAFLEX/XIAPEX in the rest of the world. Auxilium is subject to a number of risks associated with Auxilium\u2019s dependence on Auxilium\u2019s collaborative relationship with these third parties, including:\n\u00b7 adverse decisions by a third party regarding the amount and timing of resource expenditures for the development and commercialization of XIAFLEX/XIAPEX;\n\u00b7 possible disagreements as to the timing, nature and extent of Auxilium\u2019s development plans, including clinical trials or regulatory approval strategy;\n\u00b7 the right of a third party to terminate its collaboration agreement with Auxilium on limited notice upon the occurrence of certain defined events;\n\u00b7 loss of significant rights if Auxilium fails to meet Auxilium\u2019s obligations under the collaboration agreement;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of support by a third party following change of that third party\u2019s corporate strategy or due to competing priorities;\n\u00b7 changes in key management personnel at a third party that are members of the collaboration\u2019s various operating committees; and\n\u00b7 possible disagreements with a third party regarding the collaboration agreement or ownership of proprietary rights, including with respect to inventions discovered under the applicable collaborative agreement.\nDue to these factors and other possible disagreements with a third party, including potential disputes over intellectual property ownership, Auxilium may be delayed or prevented from further developing, manufacturing or commercializing XIAFLEX/XIAPEX outside the U.S., or Auxilium may become involved in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming and expensive.\nIf a third party were to terminate its collaboration agreement with Auxilium, Auxilium would need to undertake development and marketing activities for XIAFLEX/XIAPEX in that third party\u2019s territory solely at Auxilium\u2019s own expense and/or seek another partner for some or all of these activities in that territory. If Auxilium pursued these activities in that territory on Auxilium\u2019s own, it would significantly increase Auxilium\u2019s capital and infrastructure requirements, and might limit the indications Auxilium is able to pursue and could prevent Auxilium from effectively developing and commercializing XIAFLEX/XIAPEX. If Auxilium sought to find another pharmaceutical company partner for some or all of these activities, Auxilium may not be successful in such efforts, or they may result in a collaboration that has Auxilium expending greater funds and efforts than the relationship with the terminating third party.\nIn general, Auxilium cannot control the amount and timing that Auxilium\u2019s third party partners may devote to Auxilium\u2019s collaborations. Auxilium is relying on Auxilium\u2019s third-party partners to obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize XIAFLEX/XIAPEX in the relevant territories. If a third party fails to adequately market and promote XIAFLEX/XIAPEX in its territory, Auxilium may be unable to obtain any remedy against that third party and sales of XIAFLEX/XIAPEX may be harmed, which would negatively impact Auxilium\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity due to reduced milestone and royalty payments under the applicable third party agreement and, subsequently, our business and results of operations.\nAuxilium\u2019s Horsham facilities and the facilities of the manufacturer who Auxilium is in the process of qualifying as an alternate manufacturer for XIAFLEX (such manufacturer, the \u201cProposed Alternate Manufacturer\u201d and such facility, the \u201cProposed Alternate Facility\u201d) are subject to regulatory oversight, which may delay or disrupt Auxilium\u2019s development and commercialization efforts for XIAFLEX.\nAuxilium must ensure that all of the processes, methods, equipment and facilities employed in the manufacturing operations at Auxilium\u2019s Horsham facility and the Proposed Alternate Facility are compliant with the current cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. Compliance with cGMP requires record keeping and quality control to assure that the clinical and commercial product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. If Auxilium or the Proposed Alternate Manufacturer fail to comply with these requirements, Auxilium may not be permitted to sell XIAFLEX or may be limited in the jurisdictions in which Auxilium is permitted to sell them. Auxilium\u2019s manufacturing facilities and the Proposed Alternate Facility are subject to inspection by regulatory agencies at any time. If an inspection by regulatory authorities indicates that there are deficiencies including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, Auxilium could be required to take remedial actions, stop production or close Auxilium\u2019s Horsham facility or the Proposed Alternate Facility, which would disrupt the manufacturing processes, limit the supplies of XIAFLEX and delay clinical trials and subsequent licensure, and/or limit the sale of commercial supplies.\nFuture noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements may result in refusal by regulatory authorities to allow use of XIAFLEX made at Auxilium\u2019s Horsham facilities or the Proposed Alternate Facility in clinical trials, refusal of the government to allow distribution of XIAFLEX for commercialization, criminal prosecution and fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale XIAFLEX or refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts.\nAs a condition for approval of XIAFLEX for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture and XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease, Auxilium is required to comply with post-marketing requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements or any future post-marketing requirements, or the cost of compliance with such requirements, may harm our business.\nThe FDA or, for products outside the U.S. for which Auxilium holds the regulatory approvals, international regulatory agencies can establish requirements for XIAFLEX with which Auxilium must comply. For example, the law allows the FDA to require Auxilium as the sponsor of a marketing application to conduct and report the results of certain studies or clinical trials for certain purposes (\u201cpost-marketing requirements\u201d) if the FDA makes certain findings required by the statute. Failure to report or conduct the studies is considered a violation and can result in enforcement action. Additionally, the FDA can request that Auxilium voluntarily conducts studies or clinical trials to address questions or concerns (\u201cpost-marketing commitments\u201d). These studies or clinical trials could be time-consuming and costly and the results could have negative effects on Auxilium\u2019s ability to market the product.\nFor XIAFLEX for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture and XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease, Auxilium is required to implement a REMS and a REMS with an ETASU, respectively. Failure to comply, or the cost of compliance with such REMS or REMS with an ETASU may harm our business.\nThe FDA is authorized to require Auxilium as the sponsor of an approved or unapproved marketing application to submit a proposed REMS if the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks of the drug. Failure to comply with the requirements of the approved REMS can render the drug misbranded. A violation of a REMS requirement is subject to civil penalties. Complying with the requirements of a REMS can be costly and time-consuming and adversely affect Auxilium\u2019s operations.\nAs a condition of approval for XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease, the FDA required a REMS with an ETASU. The goal of the REMS with an ETASU is to certify that the appropriate physicians and practice sites are trained in the use of XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease and to attempt to mitigate the serious risk of penile fracture (corporal rupture) and other serious injuries to the penis such as hematoma. The REMS with an ETASU requires Auxilium to ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie\u2019s disease are specially certified, including the completion of a training program, and to maintain a validated secure database of healthcare providers who prescribe XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease and their specialties.\nAs a condition of approval for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, the FDA required a REMS. The goal of the REMS is to inform and train healthcare providers about the risks of tendon rupture, serious adverse reactions affecting the injected extremity, and the potential risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including the potential for anaphylaxis) associated with XIAFLEX. The REMS consists of a medication guide, a communication plan, and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS. The communication plan includes a Dear Healthcare Provider Letter and educational materials (i.e., training guide and procedure training video).\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect Auxilium\u2019s ability to sell XIAFLEX profitably, may increase competition and may increase governmental oversight and compliance costs.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare systems in ways that could impact Auxilium\u2019s ability to sell XIAFLEX profitably. In March 2010, the PPACA and the associated reconciliation bill became law, (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, and it includes a number of healthcare reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. Effective January 1, 2010, the Healthcare Reform Law increased the minimum Medicaid drug rebates for pharmaceutical companies, expanded the 340B drug discount program, and made changes to affect the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or \u201cdonut hole\u201d. The Healthcare Reform Law also revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes (effective October 1, 2010), which could increase the amount of Auxilium\u2019s Medicaid drug rebates to states. The Healthcare Reform Law also imposed annual fees on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug and biological products, which began in 2011. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were also added, which may require Auxilium to modify its business practices with healthcare practitioners.\nIn addition, the Healthcare Reform Law included provisions covering biological product exclusivity periods and a specific reimbursement methodology for biosimilars. As a new biological product, Auxilium expects that XIAFLEX will be eligible for 12 years of marketing exclusivity from the date of its approval by the FDA. The Healthcare Reform Law also established an abbreviated licensure pathway for products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with FDA-approved biological products, such as XIAFLEX. As a result, we could face competition from other pharmaceutical companies that develop biosimilar versions of XIAFLEX that do not infringe patents or other proprietary rights. Similar legislation has also been adopted in the EU.\nThe full effects of the Healthcare Reform Law cannot be known until these provisions are fully implemented and CMS and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance. Furthermore, legislation repealing, replacing or modifying all or part of the Healthcare Reform Law may be enacted or courts may issue rulings suspending, interpreting or otherwise affecting all or part of the Healthcare Reform Law, and these changes could significantly alter any advantages or disadvantages to Auxilium currently stemming from the Healthcare Reform Law. Specifically, any repeal or modification of the exclusivity for biological products could have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of XIAFLEX.\nThe cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental interest. Auxilium expects to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of XIAFLEX due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.\nIf Auxilium fails to comply with applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act of 1996, as amended , or HIPAA, and the HIPAA regulations or state health information privacy, Auxilium could be subject to significant monetary penalties and loss of reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on Auxilium and, subsequently, our business.\nThe Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA, directed the Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations establishing protections for the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, known as \u201cprotected health information.\u201d The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive requirements relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information. The HIPAA security regulations establish minimum standards for the protection of protected health information that is stored or transmitted electronically. The breach notification regulations require that certain notifications be made to individuals, to HHS and potentially to the media in the event of breaches of the privacy of protected health information. Violations of the HIPAA regulations are punishable by civil and criminal penalties.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, part of the American Recovery and Economic Reinvestment Act of 2009, contained significant changes to HIPAA, including major changes to the enforcement provisions. Among other things, HITECH significantly increased the amount of civil monetary penalties that can be imposed for violations of HIPAA. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to bring civil enforcement actions under HIPAA. These enhanced penalties and enforcement provisions went into effect immediately upon enactment of HITECH. A number of HITECH\u2019s changes to HIPAA required the issuance of implementing regulations by HHS. The breach notification regulations were promulgated as a result of HITECH. In addition, on January 25, 2013, the HHS Office for Civil Rights, or OCR, published a comprehensive set of final regulations designed to implement a number of the HITECH changes and to make other changes to the HIPAA regulations. The new regulations required compliance by September 23, 2013.\nThe changes to HIPAA enacted as part of HITECH reflect a Congressional intent that HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security provisions be more strictly enforced. It is likely that these changes will stimulate increased enforcement activity and enhance the potential that health care providers will be subject to financial penalties for violations of HIPAA.\nIn addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that protect the confidentiality of health information. Also, in response to concerns about identity theft, many states have adopted so-called \u201csecurity breach\u201d notification laws that may impose requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information, such as social security numbers and bank and credit card account numbers, and that impose an obligation to notify persons when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Some state security breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements. Violation of state security breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties.\nIf we are unable to obtain option, milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments from Auxilium or meet our needs for additional funding from other sources, we may be required to limit, scale back or cease our operations.\nOur business strategy contains elements that we will not be able to implement if we do not receive the anticipated option, milestone, royalty or earn out payments from Auxilium, or secure additional funding from other sources. While we anticipate being profitable on an ongoing, annual basis, our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 Auxilium\u2019s ability to manufacture and commercialize XIAFLEX for which we would receive milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments;\n\u00b7 Sobi\u2019s ability to commercialize XIAPEX in its territory and Actelion\u2019s ability to commercialize XIAFLEX in Canada, Australia, Mexico or Brazil;\n\u00b7 the amount actually owed to Auxilium for certain patent costs;\n\u00b7 the scope, rate of progress, cost and results of our clinical trials on additional indications, including human lipoma, for which Auxilium could exercise its option to acquire its rights;\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing, co-promotion and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights or defending against any other litigation;\n\u00b7 the extent to which Auxilium\u2019s acquisition by Endo results in reallocation of priority away from XIAFLEX; and\n\u00b7 the extent to which Auxilium focuses on men\u2019s health and away from orthopedic or dermatology (Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, frozen shoulder, cellulite and canine lipoma).\nThese factors could result in variations from our currently projected operating requirements. If our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements, we may need to limit, scale back or cease operations or, in the alternative, borrow money. Given our operations and history, we may not be able to borrow money on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we issue any equity or debt securities, the terms of such issuance may not be acceptable to us and would likely result in substantial dilution of our stockholders\u2019 investment. If we do not receive revenues from Auxilium, and are unable to secure additional financing, we may be required to cease operations.\nWe depend on Auxilium for the determination of royalty payments and cost of goods sold. While we have rights to audit Auxilium, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty and cost of goods sold calculations, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies to resolve any disputes resulting from the audit.\nThe royalty payments we receive are determined by Auxilium based on reported sales. Auxilium\u2019s calculation of the royalty payments are subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions. Auxilium\u2019s calculation of cost of goods sold are subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its internal accounting of costs. Errors may occur from time to time in these calculations. The Auxilium Agreement provides us the right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments and we are currently conducting an audit of past royalty payments and cost of goods sold; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on the part of the Company. Further, Auxilium may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.\nAlthough we exercise our royalty audit rights, we rely in the first instance on Auxilium to accurately report sales and calculate and pay applicable royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty audit rights, we rely on Auxilium\u2019s cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to exercise legal remedies to enforce our rights.\nIn order to finance and to secure the rights to conduct clinical trials for products we have licensed to Auxilium, we have granted to third parties significant rights to share in royalty payments received by us and, in some case, milestone payments to be received by us.\nTo finance and secure the rights to conduct clinical trials for products we have licensed to Auxilium, we have granted to third parties certain rights to share in royalty payments and, in some cases milestone payments, received by us from Auxilium under the Auxilium Agreement. Consequently, we will be required to share a significant portion of the payments due to us from Auxilium under the Auxilium Agreement.\nIf we breach our agreements with third parties, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur agreements with third parties impose on us various obligations, such as those related to intellectual property rights, non-competition, and development of products, as described throughout this Item 1A of this Report. If we fail to comply with such obligations, or a counterparty to our agreements believes that we have failed to comply with such obligations, we may be sued and the costs of the resulting litigation could materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Clinical Trials and Development of Drug Candidates\nOur ability to conduct clinical trials and develop products for injectable administration of collagenase is limited by the Auxilium Agreement.\nUnder the Auxilium Agreement, we have the right to conduct trials, studies or development work for, among other things, indications in human lipomas, and, upon approval by the parties\u2019 joint development committee, or the JDC, additional indications. Auxilium has pre-approved our protocols for human lipomas. However, certain material changes to the protocols must be approved by the JDC, and the JDC may decide not to approve such changes if the JDC has reasonable safety concerns. In addition, the JDC has the right to stop a study or trial in human lipomas if the rate of serious adverse events exceeds certain thresholds. If the JDC fails to approve changes to our protocol for human lipoma or if the JDC stops our studies or trials in human lipomas due to safety concerns, our ability to obtain option, milestone and royalty payments with respect to this indication would be limited. We may only conduct in vivo trials, studies or development work for additional indications beyond the pre-approved indications upon submission to and approval by the JDC of our development plan which includes in vivo studies of uterine fibroids. In the case of indications in keloids, capsular contraction after breast augmentation, arthrofibrosis following total joint replacement in humans and equine suspensory ligament desmitis, the JDC may reject our submission only for reasonable safety concerns. The JDC may reject our submission for any other additional indications for safety or commercial concerns. If the JDC rejects our submissions in any additional indications, our ability to obtain option, milestone and royalty payments with respect to those additional indications would be limited.\nAdditionally, under the Auxilium Agreement, we have licensed or granted options to certain of our rights to conduct clinical trials and develop products for injectable administration of collagenase. We agreed, for example, to certain non-competition provisions, which may limit our clinical development activities.\nWe are dependent on Auxilium for access to XIAFLEX, which may limit our ability to conduct clinical trials and to obtain the associated option, milestone and contingent royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement.\nUnder the Auxilium Agreement, we have agreed to buy at cost plus a mark-up XIAFLEX from Auxilium for conducting our trials, studies and development work. If Auxilium does not supply XIAFLEX to us, our ability to conduct clinical trials using XIAFLEX would be limited because we do not have the right to make XIAFLEX or to purchase it from third parties. Moreover, our ability to use our own clinical material may be limited both by lack of availability and by certain potential regulatory restrictions. Without adequate supply of clinical material our ability to obtain additional option, milestone and royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement would be limited.\nIf clinical trials for our potential new indications are delayed, we may not be able to obtain option, milestone or royalty payments under the Auxilium Agreement for new indications.\nClinical trials that we or our investigators may conduct may not begin on time or may need to be restructured or temporarily suspended after they have begun. Clinical trials can be delayed or may need to be restructured for a variety of reasons, including delays or restructuring related to:\n\u00b7 changes to the regulatory approval process for product candidates;\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 timing of responses required from regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 negotiating acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective investigators or trial sites;\n\u00b7 obtaining institutional review board, or equivalent, approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u00b7 recruiting subjects to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 competition in recruiting clinical investigators;\n\u00b7 shortage or lack of availability of clinical trial supplies from external and internal sources;\n\u00b7 the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results or poorly executed testing;\n\u00b7 failure to validate a patient-reported outcome questionnaire;\n\u00b7 the placement of a clinical hold on a study;\n\u00b7 the failure of third parties conducting and overseeing the operations of our clinical trials to perform their contractual or regulatory obligations in a timely fashion;\n\u00b7 exposure of clinical trial subjects to unexpected and unacceptable health risks or noncompliance with regulatory requirements, which may result in suspension of the trial; and\n\u00b7 manufacturing and/or distribution issues associated with clinical supplies.\nAuxilium has two projects currently in clinical development, specifically CCH for the treatment of frozen shoulder and cellulite. Completion of clinical trials for each product candidate will be required before commercialization. If Auxilium experiences delays in, or termination of, clinical trials, or fails to enroll patients in clinical trials in a timely manner, or if the cost or timing of the regulatory approval process increases, our financial results and the commercial prospects for product candidates for new indications will be adversely impacted.\nThe process of conducting clinical trials and developing product candidates involves a high degree of risk, may take several years, and may ultimately not be successful.\nProduct candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons, including:\n\u00b7 clinical trials may show product candidates to be ineffective or not as effective as anticipated or to have harmful side effects or any unforeseen result;\n\u00b7 product candidates may fail to receive regulatory approvals required to bring the products to market;\n\u00b7 manufacturing costs, the inability to scale up to produce supplies for clinical trials or other factors may make our product candidates uneconomical; and\n\u00b7 the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent product candidates from being effectively commercialized or from obtaining exclusivity.\nSuccess in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large-scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Any changes to the U.S. regulatory approval process could significantly increase the timing or cost of regulatory approval for product candidates making further development uneconomical or impossible. In addition, once Auxilium exercises its option with respect to an additional indication, further clinical trials, development, manufacturing, marketing and selling of such product are out of our control. Our interest is limited to receiving option, milestone and royalty payments.\nSuccessful development of drug candidates is inherently difficult and uncertain, and our long-term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners, particularly with respect to XIAFLEX, to continue to successfully commercialize these drug candidates.\nSuccessful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain. Our business requires investments in research and development over many years, often for drug candidates that may fail during the research and development process. Even if the Company is able to successfully complete the development of our drug candidates, our long-term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners, particularly with respect to XIAFLEX, to continue to successfully commercialize these drug candidates.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop drug candidates in other indications. These risks include the uncertainty of:\n\u00b7 the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the anticipated completion dates for our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently running or may commence in the future with respect to our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the scope, rate of progress of our preclinical studies and other research and development activities related to our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results for our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any strategic alliance, licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our drug candidate projects;\n\u00b7 the cost and timing of regulatory approvals with respect to our drug candidate projects; and\n\u00b7 the cost of establishing clinical supplies for our drug candidate projects.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Requirements\nWe are subject to numerous complex regulatory requirements and failure to comply with these regulations, or the cost of compliance with these regulations, may harm our business.\nConducting clinical trials for human drugs and, in certain circumstances, veterinarian trials for animal drugs, and the testing, development and manufacturing and distribution of product candidates are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, if we desire to export the resulting products to such other jurisdictions. These regulations govern or affect the testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, advertising and promotion of product candidates, as well as safe working conditions. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in suspension or termination of any ongoing clinical trials of a product candidate or refusal of the government to approve a product candidate for commercialization, criminal prosecution and fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products or refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts. The FDA and comparable governmental authorities have the authority to suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials of a product candidate or withdraw product approvals that have been previously granted. Even after a product candidate has been approved, the FDA and comparable governmental authorities subject such product to continuing review and regulatory requirements including, for example, requiring the conducting and reporting of the results of certain clinical studies or trials and commitments to voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials. In addition, regulatory approval could impose limitations on the indicated or intended uses for which product candidates may be marketed. With respect to its approval of XIAFLEX for the treatment of adult Dupuytren\u2019s contracture patients with a palpable cord, for example, the FDA and Auxilium agreed upon a REMS program consisting of a communication plan and a medication guide. With respect to its approval of XIAFLEX for Peyronie\u2019s disease, Auxilium has further collaborated with the FDA to update the REMS with an ETASU for XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie's disease in men with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of 30 degrees or greater at the start of therapy. The goal of the XIAFLEX REMS with an ETASU for Peyronie\u2019s disease is to certify that the appropriate physicians and practice sites are trained in the use of XIAFLEX and to attempt to mitigate the serious risk of penile fracture (corporal rupture) and other serious injuries to the penis such as hematoma. Currently, there is a substantial amount of congressional and administrative review of the FDA and the regulatory approval process for drug candidates in the U.S. As a result, there may be significant changes made to the regulatory approval process in the U.S. In addition, the regulatory requirements relating to the development, manufacturing, testing, promotion, marketing and distribution of product candidates may change in the U.S. Such changes may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.\nAdditionally, failure to comply with, or changes to applicable regulatory requirements may result in a variety of consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7 restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of a product from the market;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall of a product;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for a product;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 denial of permission to file an application or supplement in a jurisdiction;\n\u00b7 product seizure; and\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties against us.\nOur inability to successfully recruit and appoint a new independent member to the Board may result in our failure to meet NASDAQ listing standards and may subject the Company to delisting.\nOn October 8, 2014, we announced with great sadness that Max Link, Ph.D., a member of our Board, passed away unexpectedly on October 6, 2014. Dr. Link served as the Chair of the Compensation Committee, as the Audit Committee Financial Expert and as a member of the Board's Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. Dr. Link\u2019s untimely passing has resulted in the Board failing to have a majority of independent directors. On October 28, 2014, the Company received notice from NASDAQ acknowledging the fact that the Company does not meet the requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5605(b)(1). The Company has until the next annual meeting of stockholders to cure this deficiency or may be subject to delisting. The Board of the Company is currently reviewing candidates to replace Dr. Link on the Board and the three committees on which he served. If the Board is unable to successfully recruit and appoint a new candidate to replace Dr. Link, the Company\u2019s securities may be delisted from NASDAQ.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe are a small company and we rely heavily on third parties and outside consultants to conduct many important functions. As a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to a large body of legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, some of which have only recently been revised or adopted. We cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with all potentially applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of fines, cause the value of our common stock to decline, impede our ability to raise capital or list our securities on certain securities exchanges. New rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our committees and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nWe may fail to maintain effective internal controls over external financial reporting or such controls may fail or be circumvented.\nSOX requires us to report annually on our internal controls over financial reporting, and our business and financial results could be adversely effected if we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that these controls are not effective. In addition, any failure or circumvention of our internal controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations concerning controls and procedures could have a material effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our committees and as executive officers.\nRisks Related to Growth and Employees\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, the termination of relationships with key management, consulting and scientific personnel or the inability to recruit and retain additional personnel could prevent us from developing our technologies, conducting clinical trials and/or obtaining financing.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and we rely heavily on our ability to attract and contract with qualified independent scientific and medical investigators, and technical and managerial personnel. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, hire, retain, train and motivate highly skilled employees, including management, to increase our capabilities and support our business operations. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions. To the extent we are unable to attract and retain any of these individuals on favorable terms our business may be adversely affected.\nAdverse events or lack of efficacy in clinical trials may force us and/or our partners upon whom we are wholly dependent to stop development of our product candidates or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates or significant safety issues could arise after regulatory approval of our products, any of which could materially harm our business.\nThe prescribing information for XIAFLEX for Dupuytren\u2019s contracture made available by Auxilium lists \u201ctendon ruptures or other serious injury to the injected extremity\u201d and one \u201canaphylactic reaction reported in a post-marketing clinical study in a patient who had previous exposure to XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture\u201d as a reported serious adverse reaction to XIAFLEX and states that the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in XIAFLEX clinical trials included swelling of the injected hand, contusion, injection site reaction, injection site hemorrhage, and pain in the treated extremity. The prescribing information notes that adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug may not reflect those observed in practice because such trials \u201care conducted under widely varying conditions.\u201d\nIn the case of Peyronie\u2019s disease, the serious risks include penile fracture (corporal rupture) and other serious injuries to the penis such as hematoma. These serious risks are highlighted in the Boxed Warning within the Full Prescribing Information (the label).\nAdverse events or lack of efficacy may force us to stop development of our product candidates or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could materially harm our business. In addition, any adverse events or lack of efficacy may force Auxilium to stop development of the products we have licensed to it or prevent regulatory approval of such products, which could materially impair all or a material part of the future revenue we hope to receive from Auxilium. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, new safety issues may be reported and we or our partners may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product and may make it difficult to obtain product liability insurance for clinical trials.\nWe and our licensees face competition in our product development and marketing efforts from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and other not-for-profit institutions.\nWe and our licensees face competition in our product development and marketing efforts from entities that have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and greater financial, scientific, marketing and human resources. These entities include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and not-for-profit institutions. Our and our licensees\u2019 competitors may succeed in developing products or intellectual property earlier than we or our licensees do, entering into successful collaborations before us or our licensees, obtaining approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for such products before us or our licensees, or developing or marketing products that are more effective than those we or our licensees could develop or market. The success of any one competitor in these or other respects will have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to receive option payments from Auxilium or our ability to generate revenues from third party arrangements with respect to additional indications for which Auxilium does not exercise its option.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe continue to have product liability exposure for topical product sold by us prior to the sale of our topical business to DFB. In addition, under the Auxilium Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify Auxilium and its affiliates for any harm or losses they suffer relating to any personal injury and other product liability resulting from our development, manufacture or commercialization of any injectable collagenase product. In addition, the clinical testing and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates involves significant exposure to product liability claims. We have clinical trial and product liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $5.0 million dollars that we believe is adequate in both scope and amount and has been placed with what we believe are reputable insurers. We may not be able to maintain our clinical trial and product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses. If losses from product liability claims exceed our insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that exceed our financial resources, and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in product liability litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which could impair our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to products or technology from others, we could lose license rights that are critical to our business and our business could be harmed.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements by which we have acquired rights to use the intellectual property of third parties that are necessary for us to operate our business. If any of the parties terminates its agreement, whether by its terms or due to our breach, our right to use the party\u2019s intellectual property may negatively affect our licenses to Auxilium, and, in turn, their obligation to make option, milestone, contingent royalty or other payments to us.\nOur ability and the ability of our licensors, licensees and collaborators to develop and license products based on our patents may be impaired by the intellectual property of third parties.\nAuxilium\u2019s, and our commercial success in developing and manufacturing collagenase products based on our patents is dependent on these products not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. While we currently believe that we, our licensees, licensors and collaborators have freedom to operate in the collagenase market, others may challenge that position in the future. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties could bring legal actions against us, our licensees, licensors or collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or products. A third party might request a court to rule that the patents we in-licensed or licensed to others, or those we may in-license in the future, are invalid or unenforceable. In such a case, even if the validity or enforceability of those patents were upheld, a court might hold that the third party\u2019s actions do not infringe the patent we in-license or license to others, which could, in effect, limit the scope of our patent rights and those of our licensees, licensors or collaborators. Our agreements with Auxilium require us to indemnify them against any claims for infringement based on the use of our technology. If we become involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our resources, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If Auxilium becomes involved in such litigation, it could also consume a substantial portion of their resources, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, thereby jeopardizing their ability to commercialize candidate products and/or their ability to make option, milestone or royalty payments to us. If any of these actions is successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license to permit ourselves, our licensees, licensors or our collaborators to conduct clinical trials, manufacture or market the affected product, in which case we may be required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents. However, there can be no assurance that any such license will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Ultimately, we, our licensees, licensors or collaborators could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to cease some aspect of their or our business, as a result of patent infringement claims, which could harm our business or right to receive option, milestone and contingent royalty payments.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the United States Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the United States Congress, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nTwo cases involving diagnostic method claims and \u201cgene patents\u201d have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. On March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories, or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court subsequently decided Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, or Myriad , a case brought by multiple plaintiffs challenging the validity of patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, holding that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible.\nOn March 4, 2014, the USPTO issued a memorandum to patent examiners providing guidance for examining claims reciting laws of nature/natural principles, natural phenomena, and/or natural products for patent eligibility in view of the Supreme Court decisions in Prometheus and Myriad. The guidance indicates that claims reciting such natural subject matter, read as a whole, that do not significantly differ from such natural subject matter should be rejected as non-statutory subject matter. That guidance was replaced by a memorandum issued December 15, 2014, that modified some of the earlier guidance, but a number of the aspects have not substantially changed, and it is too soon to determine how the revised guidance will be applied. We cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by the guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nWe cannot fully predict what impact the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Prometheus and Myriad may have on the ability of biopharmaceutical companies or other entities to obtain or enforce patents relating to purified natural products in the future. Despite the USPTO guidance described above, the Prometheus and Myriad decisions are new and the contours of when claims to laws of nature, natural phenomena or natural products meet the patent eligibility requirements are not clear and may take many years to develop via interpretation in the courts. There are many patents claiming diagnostic methods based on similar or related correlations that issued before Prometheus, and although some of these patents may be invalid under the standard set forth in Prometheus, until successfully challenged, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable, and certain third parties could allege that we or our licensees infringe, or request that we or our licensees obtain a license to, these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after Prometheus, we could have to defend ourselves against claims of patent infringement, or choose to license rights, if available, under patents claiming such methods. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving third-party intellectual property rights, if we or our licensees are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we or they could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter in question if we or they are unable to obtain a license on reasonable terms. Such outcomes could materially affect our ability to offer our products and have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we are able to obtain a license or successfully defend against claims of patent infringement, the cost and distraction associated with the defense or settlement of these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged, and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and, if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock could negatively affect our stock price.\nIf our common stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stock price may decline and our existing stockholders may experience dilution of their interests. Because we historically have not declared dividends, stockholders must rely on an increase in the stock price for any return on their investment in us.\nOur stock price has, in the past, been volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop below the current price.\nOur stock price has, at times, been volatile. Currently, our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, and is thinly traded.\nMarket prices for securities of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies have been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure of any product candidates we have licensed to Auxilium to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7 failure of Auxilium to exercise any opt in rights to new indications;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 litigation involving us or our general industry, or both;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock by the estate of our former Chairman and CEO, directors, officers, or others;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including developments in price control legislation;\n\u00b7 departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 termination of agreements with our licensees or their sublicensees;\n\u00b7 announcements of material events by those companies that are our competitors or perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in estimates of our financial results;\n\u00b7 investors\u2019 general perception of us;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7 the reallocation by Endo of its priorities away from XIAFLEX or orthopedic or dermatological indications.\nIf any of these risks occurs, or continues to occur, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. In addition, purchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program may, depending on the timing and volume of such repurchases, result in our stock price being higher than it would be in the absence of such repurchases. If repurchases pursuant to the program are discontinued, our stock price may fall.\nWe may become subject to stockholder activism efforts that could cause material disruption to our business.\nCertain influential institutional investors, hedge funds and other stockholders have taken steps to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of certain companies due to governance or strategic related disagreements between such companies and such stockholders. If we become subject to such stockholder activism efforts, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have no current plan to pay dividends on our common stock and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares. We cannot assure investors of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares nor can we assure that investors will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nOur outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock could have a possible dilutive effect.\nAs of December 31, 2014, options to purchase 759,958 shares of common stock were outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, a total of 239,098 options were available for grant under our stock option plans. The issuance of common stock upon the exercise of these options could adversely affect the market price of the common stock or result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they downgrade us or our sector, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on research reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If analysts downgrade us or any of our licensees, or other research analysts downgrade the industry in which we operate or the stock of any of our competitors or licensees, the price of our common stock will probably decline. We currently have no analysts covering our stock and, consequently, lack the potential benefit that such coverage may provide.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or frustrate a change in control.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions:\n\u00b7 provide for a classified board of directors;\n\u00b7 give our Board the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7 limit the ability of the stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u00b7 impose advance notice requirements on stockholders concerning the election of directors and other proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, during May 2002, the Board implemented a rights agreement, commonly known as a Poison Pill, which effectively discourages or prevents acquisitions of more than 15% of our common stock in transactions (mergers, consolidations, tender offer, etc.) that have not been approved by our Board. The Board amended the Poison Pill in February 2011 to increase the threshold from 15% to 18% and extended the expiration date of the Poison Pill for an additional two years, to May 31, 2014. In February 2014, the Board amended the Poison Pill again to extend the term for an additional two years, to May 31, 2016. These provisions could make it more difficult for common stockholders to replace members of the Board. Because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team.\nIf our principal stockholders, executive officers and directors choose to act together, they may be able to control our operations, acting in their own best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nAs of March 3, 2015 our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 25.2% of our common stock. Beneficial ownership includes shares over which an individual or entity has investment or voting power and includes shares that could be issued upon the exercise of options within 60 days. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they may be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these individuals, if they chose to act together, could control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to other stockholders.\nThis significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders.", "PERMNO": 77208, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "BSTC"}
