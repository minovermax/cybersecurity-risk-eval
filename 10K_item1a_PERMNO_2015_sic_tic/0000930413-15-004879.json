{"cik": "779544", "company": "ARK RESTAURANTS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are the most significant risk factors applicable to us:\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are dependent upon key personnel and may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future.\nWe are dependent upon the continued services of Michael Weinstein, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and a number of key management and other team members who have significant influence over the Company\u2019s business strategy and managerial decisions. The Company does not have an employment agreement with Mr. Weinstein. The loss of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s services or other key personnel, or limitations on their involvement with the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any officers of the Company.\nFailure of our existing or new restaurants to achieve expected results could have a negative impact on our revenues and performance results.\nPerformance results currently achieved by our restaurants may not be indicative of longer term performance or the potential market acceptance of restaurants in new locations. We cannot be assured that new restaurants that we open will have similar operating results as existing restaurants. New restaurants take several months or longer to reach expected operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including lack of market awareness, inability to hire sufficient staff and other factors. The failure of our existing or new restaurants to perform as predicted could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nOur unfamiliarity with new markets may present risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.\nDue to higher operating costs caused by temporary inefficiencies typically associated with expanding into new regions and opening new restaurants, such as lack of market awareness and acceptance and limited availability of experienced staff, continued expansion may result in an increase in our operating costs. New markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our restaurants in these new markets to be less successful than our restaurants in our existing markets. We cannot assure you that restaurants in new markets will be successful.\nOur ability to open new restaurants efficiently is subject to a number of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n-- Selection and availability of suitable restaurant sites;\n-- Negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for such sites;\n-- Negotiation of reasonable construction contracts and adequate supervision of construction;\n-- Our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals for both construction and operation;\n-- Availability of adequate capital;\n-- General economic conditions; and\n-- Adverse weather conditions.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these factors, which could adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants on a timely basis, or at all. Delays in opening or failures to open new restaurants could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nIncreases in the minimum wage may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nMany of our employees are subject to various minimum wage requirements. Many of our restaurants are located in states where the minimum wage was recently increased and in other states in which increases are being considered. In addition, the one-day strikes for fast-food workers for an increase in the minimum wage to $15 per hour may result in further increases in the minimum wage which would affect all restaurant workers. Accordingly, there likely will be additional increases implemented in jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate. These minimum wage increases may cause us to raise our prices which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the overall economy may adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends significantly on discretionary consumer spending. Any weakness in discretionary consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe restaurant industry has been affected by economic factors, including the deterioration of national, regional and local economic conditions, high unemployment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Disruptions in the overall economy have reduced, and may continue to reduce, consumer confidence in the economy, negatively affecting consumer restaurant spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. See Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to recently adopted accounting standards.\nChanges to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nOur profitability is dependent in large measure on food, beverage and supply costs which are not within our control.\nOur profitability is dependent in large measure on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food, beverage and supply costs. Various factors beyond our control, including climate changes and government regulations, may affect food and beverage costs. Specifically, our dependence on frequent, timely deliveries of fresh beef, poultry, seafood and produce subjects us to the risks of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather, food contamination and related recalls or other conditions, which could adversely affect the availability and cost of any such items. We cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate or react to increasing food and supply costs in the future. The failure to\nreact to these increases could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability.\nThe cost of insurance (workers compensation insurance, general liability insurance, property insurance, health insurance and directors and officers liability insurance) has risen significantly over the past few years and is expected to continue to increase. These increases, as well as potential state legislation requirements for employers to provide health insurance to employees, could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to negate the effect of such increases with plan modifications and cost control measures or by continuing to improve our operating efficiencies.\nCompliance with existing and new regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nCompliance with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. This investment, required to comply with these changing regulations, may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nIntense competition in the restaurant industry could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location, and many restaurants compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established in the markets where we have restaurants, or in which we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop restaurants that operate with similar concepts.\nAny inability to successfully compete with the other restaurants in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our restaurant system to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that may develop in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.\nMany of our operations are located in casinos and much of our success will be dependent on the success of those casinos.\nThe success of the business of our restaurants located in Las Vegas, Nevada, Atlantic City, New Jersey, Tampa and Hollywood, Florida, and Ledyard, Connecticut is substantially dependent on the success of the casinos in which the Company operates in these locations to attract customers for themselves and for our restaurants. In particular, casinos in Atlantic City have experienced a significant decline in revenues in recent years as a result of the economic downturn, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and the fact that numerous casinos have opened in other locations in the Eastern United States. Five of the twelve casinos in Atlantic City have closed. Although the Company did not operate any restaurants in the casinos that closed and the Company\u2019s restaurants in Atlantic City actually experienced an increase in sales of approximately\n10.7% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015, the downturn affecting Atlantic City casinos and tourism in general could have a material adverse effect on our restaurants in the city.\nAs more states approve casino gambling, our business in casinos in existing geographic regions may continue to decline. The successful operation of the casinos in these locations is subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to:\n-- The risk associated with governmental approvals of gaming;\n-- The risk of a change in laws regulating gaming operations;\n-- Operating in a limited market;\n-- Competitive risks relating to casino operations; and\n-- Risks of terrorism and war.\nThere can be no assurance casino gambling will be approved at New Meadowlands Racetrack.\nThe Company has invested an aggregate of $4,886,000 in the New Meadowlands Racetrack (\u201cNMR\u201d) through its investment in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR to which it has also loaned $1,500,000. The Company has the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in a casino at NMR if casino gambling is approved. No bill was introduced in 2015 to have it on the ballot for 2015. While legislation was introduced in December 2015 for a November 2016 referendum to approve two new casinos in Northern New Jersey, there can be no assurance this bill will pass, or that a referendum will be held in 2016, and that a casino will be approved at NMR with Meadowlands Newmark LLC granted the right to conduct gambling at such a casino.\nThe restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns that could result in a reduction in our revenues.\nWe continuously need to monitor and to modify our restaurants\u2019 menus, for changes in consumer preferences. These changes may cause us to lose customers, who are less satisfied with such modified menu, and we may not be able to attract a new customer base to generate the necessary revenues to maintain our income from restaurant operations. A change in our menus may also result in us having different competitors. We may not be able to successfully compete against established competitors in the general restaurant market. Our success also depends on various factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Adverse changes in these factors could reduce our customer base and spending patterns, either of which could reduce our revenues and results of operations.\nOur geographic concentrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently operate in seven regions, New York City, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, Nevada, Florida, Atlantic City, New Jersey, Ledyard, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in these markets, including its labor market, which could have a negative impact on our profitability as a whole. In addition, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as could other regional occurrences such as acts of terrorism, local strikes, natural disasters or changes in laws or regulations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly due to seasonality and other factors beyond our control.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may vary greatly depending upon the region of the United States in which a particular restaurant is located. In addition to seasonality, our quarterly and\nannual operating results and comparable unit sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n-- The amount of sales contributed by new and existing restaurants;\n-- The timing of new openings and closings;\n-- Increases in the cost of key food or beverage products;\n-- Labor costs for our personnel;\n-- Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis;\n-- Adverse weather;\n-- Consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences;\n-- Health concerns, including adverse publicity concerning food-related illnesses;\n-- The level of competition from existing or new competitors;\n-- Economic conditions generally and in each of the markets in which we are located; and\n-- Acceptance of a new or modified concept in each of the new markets in which we could be located.\nThese fluctuations make it difficult for us to predict and address in a timely manner factors that may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny expansion may strain our infrastructure, which could slow restaurant development.\nAny expansion may place a strain on our management systems, financial controls, and information systems. To manage growth effectively, we must maintain the high level of quality and service at our existing and future restaurants. We must also continue to enhance our operational, information, financial and management systems and locate, hire, train and retain qualified personnel, particularly restaurant managers. We cannot predict whether we will be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that any expansion will impose on management and those systems and controls. If we are not able to effectively manage any one or more of these or other aspects of expansion, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur inability to retain key personnel could negatively impact our business.\nOur success will continue to be highly dependent on our key operating officers and employees. We must continue to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel, including general managers and chefs. The ability of these key personnel to maintain consistency in the quality and atmosphere of our restaurants is a critical factor in our success. Any failure to do so may harm our reputation and result in a loss of business.\nWe could face labor shortages, increased labor costs and other adverse effects of varying labor conditions.\nThe development and success of our restaurants depend, in large part, on the efforts, abilities, experience and reputations of the general managers and chefs at such restaurants. In addition, our success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff and wait staff. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants. A significant delay in finding qualified employees or high turnover of existing employees could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, competition for qualified employees could\nrequire us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient qualified employees, which could result in higher, labor costs. In addition, increases in the minimum hourly wage, employment tax rates and levies, related benefits costs, including health insurance, and similar matters over which we have no control may increase our operating costs.\nUnanticipated costs or delays in the development or construction of future restaurants could prevent our timely and cost-effective opening of new restaurants.\nWe depend on contractors and real estate developers to construct our restaurants. Many factors may adversely affect the cost and time associated with the development and construction of our restaurants, including, but not limited to:\n-- Labor disputes;\n-- Shortages of materials or skilled labor;\n-- Adverse weather conditions;\n-- Unforeseen engineering problems;\n-- Environmental problems;\n-- Construction or zoning problems;\n-- Local government regulations;\n-- Modifications in design; and\n-- Other unanticipated increases in costs.\nAny of these factors could give rise to delays or cost overruns, which may prevent us from developing additional restaurants within our anticipated budgets or time periods or at all. Any such failure could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain necessary federal, state and local permits which could delay or prevent the opening of future restaurants.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including regulations relating to:\n-- Alcoholic beverage control;\n-- The purchase, preparation and sale of food;\n-- Public health and safety;\n-- Sanitation, building, zoning and fire codes; and\n-- Employment and related tax matters.\nAll of these regulations impact not only our current operations but also our ability to open future restaurants. We will be required to comply with applicable state and local regulations in new locations into which we expand. Any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining licenses, permits or approvals in such new locations could delay or prevent the opening of a restaurant in a particular area or reduce operations at an existing location, either of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber-attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nAdditionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our corporate office in New York. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support restaurant operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates and confidential and proprietary information of the company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues and litigation.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and team members in our information technology systems, such as point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms. Additionally our systems contain proprietary and confidential information related to our business. Use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If our or our business associates\u2019 information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack or other external or internal method, or we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in a violation of the laws and regulations, and an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us or the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack, failure or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. Like many other retail companies, we experience frequent attempts to compromise our systems but none have resulted in a material breach. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur additional costs in technology, third party services and personnel to remain in compliance and maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. Our security frameworks prevent breaches of our systems and data loss, but these measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nThe restaurant industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues, which can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and result in liabilities.\nHealth concerns, including adverse publicity concerning food-related illness, although not specifically related to our restaurants, could cause guests to avoid restaurants in general, which would have a negative impact on our sales. We may also be the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging food-related illness, injuries suffered on the premises or other food quality, health or operational concerns. A lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may also be subject to litigation which, regardless of the outcome, could result in adverse publicity. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us and our restaurants, regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable. Such litigation, adverse publicity or damages could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. A large number of shares of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a small number of individuals and institutional investors and is thinly traded. An attempt to sell by a large holder could adversely affect the price of our stock.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n-- Fluctuations in quarterly or annual results of operations;\n-- Changes in published earnings estimates by analysts and whether our actual earnings meet or exceed such estimates;\n-- Additions or departures of key personnel;\n-- Our ability to execute our business plan and open new restaurants;\n-- Changes in the restaurant industry;\n-- Competitive pricing pressures;\n-- Regulatory developments; and\n-- Changes in overall stock market conditions, including the stock prices of other restaurant companies.\nIn addition, our principal stockholders\u2019 ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempt to obtain control of the Company, which, in time, could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced extreme fluctuations in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were to be subject to such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOwnership of a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock by a limited number of stockholders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nA substantial majority of our capital stock is held by a limited number of stockholders. Almost 50% of our common stock is beneficially owned by officers and directors of the Company. Accordingly, management and a few other stockholders have a strong influence on major decisions of corporate policy, and the outcome of any major transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders, including, but not limited to, potential mergers, acquisitions and/or sale of substantially all assets or other corporate transactions, and amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Stockholders other than these principal stockholders are therefore likely to have little influence on decisions regarding such matters. One such event occurred in February 2013 when the Company received an unsolicited proposal to purchase all of the capital stock of the Company. The Company rejected the offer after careful consideration including a review of the proposal with its independent financial and legal advisors.\nProvisions in our charter documents and New York law could discourage or prevent a takeover, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of New York law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n-- The New York anti-takeover statute prevents any shareholder who acquires more than 20% of the Company\u2019s capital stock from acquiring control of the Company for a five-year period, unless approved by the Board, which the Company did not approve in connection with the unsolicited takeover proposal in 2013 described above.\n-- prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect direct candidates; and\n-- advance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals that may prevent or hinder any attempt by our stockholders to bring business to be considered by our stockholders at a meeting or replace our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 85586, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "ARKR"}
