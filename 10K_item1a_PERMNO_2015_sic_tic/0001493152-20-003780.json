{"cik": "1076682", "company": "POLARITYTE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks occur, our financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses, and may continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years. We incurred a net loss of $92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $65.4 million for the 12-month period ended October 31, 2018. Our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend in large part upon the successful commercialization of SkinTE, and we are unable to predict when, if ever, that may occur. Our continuing capital needs to support expansion of the marketing effort, clinical trials, and other costs of our business could cause us to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to our stockholders. In these circumstances, there is no assurance that we would be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf the commercialization of our lead product candidate, SkinTE, is not successful, our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur near-term prospects depend upon our ability to effectively market our lead product candidate, SkinTE. Gaining market acceptance and market share depends on a number of factors, including favorable completion of pending clinical trials, obtaining certainty on reimbursement for different applications, and our ability to develop an effective sales team. If we are not successful in commercializing SkinTE or are significantly delayed in doing so, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur revenue growth for SkinTE depends on our ability to expand our sales force, increase distribution and sales to existing customers and develop new customers, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.\nWe are in the process of investing in development of our direct sales force to allow for the opportunity to increase sales to existing customers and reach new customers. There can be no assurance that this effort will result in a meaningful increase in revenues. We expect to incur substantial expense to expand our sales force, and there is no assurance that we will recoup this investment through increased sales or that any increase in sales will allow us to sustain our operations.\nMeaningful revenue growth in the foreseeable future is dependent on one product - SkinTE.\nWhile a contributor to revenues, we do not believe our contract services business offers a revenue growth opportunity substantial enough to sustain our operations. Meaningful revenue growth will come from sales of regenerative tissue products and biomaterials, and the only such product we will be selling for the foreseeable future is SkinTE. To the extent that sales of SkinTE lag behind our need to generate revenue to make up the gap between available capital and cash flow from operations or there is a disruption in our ability to generate revenue from the distribution of SkinTE, our results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects would be materially, adversely affected.\nOur ability to effectively sell SkinTE depends on a number of factors that we are still learning about.\nFactors impacting our ability to successfully commercialize SkinTE include:\n\u25cf obtaining data from clinical trials that supports the efficacy of SkinTE;\n\u25cf our ability to educate and train physicians and hospitals on the benefits of our product;\n\u25cf the rate at which providers adopt our product;\n\u25cf our ability to scale up our commercialization of SkinTE in a way that generates positive results;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from third parties for our product; and\n\u25cf other activities generally necessary to accelerate market acceptance of a relatively new product that represents a change from traditional treatment regimens.\nWe began marketing SkinTE on a regional level in the fourth quarter of 2018, so we are still learning about the market and how to approach it with our product. We have begun to identify important factors, such as the items listed above, that affect our sales effort and continue to gain insight as our experience with marketing SkinTE grows. As we are still in the learning stage, we cannot predict when, if ever, we will succeed in establishing a formula for selling SkinTE that will produce revenue at a level sufficient to sustain our operations.\nWe will incur substantial costs in terms of both money and corporate resources for clinical and preclinical trials, and the results of these trials is uncertain.\nWe are pursuing two clinical trials for DFUs and VLUs and are evaluating plans for additional clinical trials for SkinTE. Clinical trials entail substantial costs, and we will continue to incur substantial costs on clinical trials for SkinTE. In addition, we expect that we will pursue development work and pre-clinical trials on our product development projects, which will result in additional costs with no assurance that the research and development work will result in any marketable product or revenue for us. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost of completion, and potentially detract from our effort to commercialize SkinTE. Finally, there is no assurance that the results of a clinical or preclinical trial will be helpful in advancing the marketability or development of any product, and to the extent the results are not helpful, it is unlikely we would be able to recoup our investment in these trials and development efforts.\nOur success will be dependent on our ability to achieve a meaningful level of SkinTE acceptance by the medical community.\nWe believe the lack of SkinTE clinical trials, which we were not required to obtain before commercialization as a 361 HTC/P, has adversely affected the acceptance of SkinTE by the wound care segment of the medical community. While we hope that our clinical trials will provide positive results, which will help to advance acceptance of SkinTE, we cannot guarantee this outcome. Our ability to gain, and then maintain, acceptance depends on whether we can demonstrate that SkinTE is an attractive alternative to existing or wound care treatment options, including both surgical techniques and products. Our ability to do so will depend on physicians\u2019 evaluations of clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, including insurance reimbursement. If the medical community and patients do not accept SkinTE as safe and effective, our ability to sell SkinTE and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenues from our regenerative medicine business will depend upon adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and health systems.\nOur success will depend on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our treatments will be available from third-party payers, such as public and private insurers and health systems, as well as the amounts that they will agree to reimburse. Government and other third-party payers attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and the amount of reimbursement for new treatments. Until established payment rates are set by payers, significant uncertainty usually exists as to the reimbursement status of new healthcare treatments. If we are not successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement for our treatments from these third-party payers, the market\u2019s acceptance of our treatments could be adversely affected. Inadequate reimbursement levels also likely would create downward price pressure on our treatments. Even if we succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement for our treatments at adequate pricing, future changes in reimbursement policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommercial third-party payers and government payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts, including by limiting coverage on which products they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new products or products in competitive markets, and by creating conditions to reimbursement, such as coverage eligibility requirements based upon clinical evidence development involving research studies and the collection of physician decision impact and patient outcomes data. Because of these cost-containment trends, commercial third-party payers and government payers that currently provide or in the future may provide reimbursement for one or more of our products or product candidates may reduce, suspend, revoke, or discontinue payments or coverage at any time, including those payers that designate one or more of our product candidates as experimental and investigational. Payers may also create conditions to coverage or contract with third-party vendors to manage laboratory benefit coverage, in both cases creating burdens for ordering by physicians and patients that may make our products more difficult to sell. The percentage of submitted claims that are ultimately paid, the length of time to receive payment on claims, and the average reimbursement of those paid claims, is likely to vary from period to period. Finally, payers may demand discounts or offer reimbursement that minimizes our ability to sell our products profitably, or simply choose to not cover or reimburse our products at all.\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of products that incorporate new technology, such as our product candidates, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payers and government payers or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for these product candidates. The fact that a product has been approved for reimbursement in the past for any particular intended use or indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such product will remain approved for reimbursement, will continue to be reimbursed at comparable rates, or that similar or additional products will be approved for reimbursement in the future. Reimbursement of our existing and future products by commercial third-party payers and government payers may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that our existing and future products are:\n\u25cf not experimental or investigational;\n\u25cf medically reasonable and necessary;\n\u25cf appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf cost effective;\n\u25cf supported by peer-reviewed publications;\n\u25cf included in clinical practice guidelines and pathways; and\n\u25cf supported by clinical utility and health economic studies demonstrating improved outcomes and cost effectiveness.\nMarket acceptance, sales of products based upon our platform technology, and our profitability may depend on reimbursement policies and healthcare reform measures. Several entities conduct technology assessments and provide the results of their assessments for informational purposes to other parties. These assessments may be used by third-party payers and healthcare providers as grounds to limit or deny coverage for a product. The levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, may reimburse the price patients pay for such products could affect whether we are able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product and product candidates may receive negative assessments that may impact our ability to receive reimbursement for a product. We cannot be sure that reimbursement in the United States or elsewhere will be available for any of our products or product candidates in the future. If reimbursement is not available or is limited, our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates would be substantially impaired, which would adversely affect the viability of our commercial operations.\nThe United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose healthcare requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed or accountable care in the United States will continue to put pressure on product utilization and pricing. Utilization and cost control initiatives could decrease the volume of orders or payment that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. If we are unable to obtain or maintain reimbursement approval from commercial third-party payers and Medicare and Medicaid programs for our products and product candidates, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenues could be limited.\nThere may be significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe are at the beginning of the second year of our focused commercialization effort for SkinTE, so significant quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations are expected because our customer base, while growing, remains very small in relation to the overall wound care market. Fluctuations in quarterly results may also be caused by seasonal changes in wound care treatment demand, timing of sales force expansion, and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues and profits, if any, we achieve in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. Our spending on operations is based, in part, on our expectations as to future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues.\nThe recent widespread outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) has resulted in business closures and disruptions that may affect various suppliers of items we may use to produce and deliver SkinTE, notwithstanding the fact that we operate entirely within the United States. A significant outbreak of coronavirus and other contagious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that might have a chilling effect on patients seeking treatment from healthcare providers for conditions where SkinTE may be suitable, and could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing operations in the U.S. depend primarily on one facility. If this facility is destroyed or we experience any manufacturing difficulties, disruptions, or delays, this could limit supply of our product or adversely affect our ability to sell products or conduct our clinical trials, and our business would be adversely impacted.\nAll of the manufacturing of SkinTE takes place at our single U.S. facility. We are in the process of developing another manufacturing facility in Augusta, Georgia, but this facility is not yet operational. If regulatory, manufacturing, or other problems require us to discontinue production at our current facility, we will not be able to supply SkinTE to patients or have supplies for clinical trials, which would adversely impact our business. If this facility or the equipment in it is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, power loss, or similar events, we may not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing capacity or replace the facility at all. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to quickly transfer manufacturing to our facility under development or to another third party. Even if we could transfer manufacturing from one facility to another, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since an alternative facility would need to comply with applicable cGTP or the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) regulatory and quality standard requirements and, if applicable, FDA approval would be required before any products manufactured at that facility could be made commercially available.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation and the relationship between us and the healthcare providers with which we work.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of skin harvested from patients and the return of SkinTE manufactured for those patients, and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage, or destruction of any delivery systems, it could result in delays in delivering our product and spoilage of the SkinTE we produce for patients, which is viable for 14 days following the skin harvest date. Any such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our solution and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to process orders for SkinTE on a timely basis.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation and disrupt our business.\nThe manufacturing, marketing, and processing of our products and product candidates involves an inherent risk that our tissue products or processes do not meet applicable quality standards and requirements. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall or market withdrawal of one of our products would be costly and would divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products because of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or because of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nWe intend to, but may not be successful in, establishing and maintaining licensing agreements or strategic partnerships.\nWe may pursue licensing or strategic partnership opportunities in the future to enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of our existing products and potential product candidates. We may rely on such arrangements to assist in launching, marketing, and developing our products and product candidates. However, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate arrangements and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a licensing, strategic partnership, or other alternative arrangements for any present or future proposed products and programs for a variety of reasons. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish licensing agreements or strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such arrangements if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved or registered product are disappointing.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving field and face competition from regenerative medicine, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors and medical device manufacturers, as well as new market entrants.\nWe operate in a competitive and continually evolving field. Competition from other regenerative medicine, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies, tissue engineering entities, tissue processors, medical device companies and from research and academic institutions is intense, expected to increase, subject to rapid change, and could be significantly affected by new product introductions. Our failure to compete effectively would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSpecifically, we face significant competition in the wound care space from multiple products, including ReCell, Integra Bilayer Wound Matrix, EpiFix, Apligraf, Dermagraft, Grafix, Epicel, and others. The availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of SkinTE is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to SkinTE, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products, or choose to reserve SkinTE for use in limited circumstances.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and we expect that SkinTE will face intense competition from existing or future products.\nSkinTE faces intense competition from existing and future products marketed by large, well-established companies (including but not limited to Avita Medical, Integra LifeSciences, Wright Medical Group, MiMedx, Osiris, Organogenesis, Allosource, MTF Biologics and Vericel). These competitors may successfully market products that compete in the wound care market, successfully identify product candidates or develop products earlier than we do, or develop products that are more effective or safe, or that cost less than SkinTE. These competitive factors could require us to conduct additional research and development activities to establish new competitive product targets, which would be costly and time consuming. These activities would adversely affect our ability to effectively commercialize SkinTE and achieve revenue and profits.\nWe may have inadequate resources to pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates or to continue our development programs.\nWe are focused on employing our resources to commercialize SkinTE, and thus we expect to continue to use our capital to advance that objective rather than on research and development on product candidates that will take a long time to evaluate and develop. Until we can successfully commercialize our product candidates and achieve significant revenue, if any, it is unlikely we will be able to make a significant capital commitment to research and development of new product candidates.\nThe cost and timing of completion of our preclinical and clinical development programs is uncertain.\nWe expect that a large percentage of our future research and development expenses will be incurred in support of current and future preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost of completion. We evaluate our objectives in preclinical models based upon our own development goals, but such evaluation may differ from requirements of regulatory authorities. We may conduct early stage clinical trials, which may differ for each of our potential product opportunities. As we obtain results from investigations, preclinical studies, or clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay further evaluations for certain product candidates or programs to focus resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials may take several years and the length of time generally varies according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of a product candidate. The cost of clinical trials is uncertain and may vary significantly over the life of a product or development project because of unanticipated differences, regulatory requirements, or other obligations, or challenges arising during clinical development.\nOur product development programs are based on novel technologies. As a result, our product candidates are inherently risky.\nWe cannot guarantee that the results we see in clinical applications will be comparable to the preclinical results we have observed in animals for all our product candidates. We also cannot at this stage be certain of the safety of all product candidates that may be developed from our core technology in humans.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies. The novel nature of our products creates significant challenges regarding product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement, and market acceptance. For example, if regulatory agencies have limited experience or concerns in approving cellular and tissue-based therapies for commercialization, the development and commercialization pathway for our therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs.\nOur potential product candidates represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept. Furthermore, the success of our product candidates is dependent on wider acceptance by the medical community.\nThe market may not understand or accept our potential product candidates. Our product candidates represent new treatments or therapies and compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others. The new nature of our potential product candidates creates significant challenges regarding product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement. As a result, the development pathway for any such product and its commercialization may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathways for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our potential products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf The clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u25cf Our ability to convince healthcare providers that the use of our products in a procedure is more beneficial than the standard of care or other available methods;\n\u25cf Our ability to explain clearly and educate others on the autologous use of patient-specific human cells and tissue-based products, and to avoid potential confusion with and differentiate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue and engineered human tissue;\n\u25cf Adverse reactions involving our products or the products or product candidates of others that are cell- or tissue-based; and\n\u25cf The cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and other third-party payers, including the amounts of reimbursement made for our products and the conditions for such reimbursement.\nIf patients or the medical community do not accept our potential products as safe and effective for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, it could affect our sales, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development or use of our product candidates or with any procedures with which our product candidates are used, we may need to abandon or limit our development of those product candidates.\nIf SkinTE or other products we develop are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their use or development, or limit them to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In addition, if any of the procedures with which our products are used is determined to be unsafe, we may be required to delay, alter, or abandon our product development or commercialization.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing, and marketing of human cellular and tissue-based products. We may be subject to such claims if our products cause, or appear to have caused, an injury during clinical trials or after commercialization. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers, or others selling our products. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention, and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal, or reduced acceptance, of our products in the market.\nAlthough we have obtained product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. If we are unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and other personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management and other key personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with all of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could therefore negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we do not carry any key person insurance policies that could offset potential loss of service under applicable circumstances.\nWe have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages.\nIn addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it will negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe do not currently own any issued patents in the United States and our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain and may be inadequate, which could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in technologies that presently consist of trade secrets and patent applications. We currently have no issued patents in the United States relating to any of our product candidates. We intend to expand our patenting activities and rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology, and there can be no assurance these methods of protection will be effective. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, our presently pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our activities that are not currently protected by issued patents in the United States. The patent application process can be time consuming and expensive. We cannot ensure that any of the pending patent applications we acquire, have acquired, or may file will result in issued patents. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop procedures that provide outcomes that are comparable or even superior to ours. There is no assurance that the inventors of the patents and applications that we expect to own or license were the first-to-invent or the first-inventor-to-file on the inventions, or that a third party will not claim ownership in one of our patents or patent applications. We cannot assure you that a third party does not have or will not obtain patents that could preclude us from practicing the patents we own or license now or in the future.\nThe failure to obtain and maintain patents or protect our intellectual property rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We cannot be certain that, if challenged, any patents we ultimately obtain would be upheld because a determination of the validity and enforceability of a patent involves complex issues of fact and law. If one or more of any patents we obtain is invalidated or held unenforceable, such an outcome could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we might otherwise have had.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon any patent we obtain, or a third party including but not limited to a university or other research institution, makes a claim of ownership over our patents or other intellectual property rights, confirming, defending, or enforcing those rights may be costly, uncertain, difficult, and time consuming.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including, but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology.\nThere can be no assurance that a third party, including but not limited to, a university or other research institution that our founders were associated with in the past, will not make claims to ownership or other claims related to our technology. We believe we have developed our technology outside of any institutions, but we cannot guarantee such institutions would not assert a claim to the contrary. Even if successful, litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention. Further, bringing litigation to enforce our future patent(s) subjects us to the potential for counterclaims. If one or more of our current or future patents is challenged in U.S. or foreign courts or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or foreign patent offices, the patent(s) may be found invalid or unenforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any court or any patent office ultimately cancels or narrows the claims in any of our patents through any pre- or post-grant patent proceedings, such an outcome could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce the patent against competitors. Such adverse decisions could negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully appropriated, used, or disclosed intellectual property of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed by other companies, universities, or academic institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a prior employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that former or current employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents, patent applications, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to any of our product candidates, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our technology, including our knowledge regarding certain aspects of the manufacture of our products and potential product candidates, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. To protect these trade secrets, the information is restricted to our employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, do not ensure protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements and other obligations of our employees to assign intellectual property to the Company may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators, or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our treatment, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages. We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain any formal legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nThird parties could assert that our processes, product candidates, or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Whether a process, product, or technology infringes a patent or other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will not be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Because patent applications may remain unpublished for certain periods of time and may take years to be issued as patents, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware or that do not currently contain claims of concern that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates, procedures, or processes will infringe. There may be existing patents that our product candidates, procedures, or processes infringe, of which infringement we are not aware. Third parties could also assert ownership over our intellectual property. Such an ownership claim could cause us to incur significant costs to litigate the ownership issues. If an ownership claim by a third party were upheld as valid, we may be unable to obtain a license from the third party on acceptable terms, to continue to make, use, or sell technology free from claims by that third party of infringement of the third party\u2019s intellectual property. We have not obtained, and do not have a present intention to obtain, any legal opinion regarding our freedom to practice our technology.\nIf we are unsuccessful in actions we bring against the patents of other parties, and it is determined that we infringe upon the patents of third parties, we may be subject to injunctions, or otherwise prevented from commercializing potential products or services in the relevant jurisdiction, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or develop or obtain alternative technologies, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved in our favor, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain product candidates or services, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are successful in obtaining patent protection, we may not be able to enforce those patent rights against third parties.\nSuccessful challenge of any patents or future patents or patent applications such as through opposition, reexamination, inter partes review, interference, or derivation proceedings could result in a loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required relating to intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside of the United States.\nIntellectual property law outside the United States is uncertain and, in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries do not protect patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Third parties may challenge our patents in foreign countries by initiating pre- and post-grant oppositions or invalidation proceedings. Developments during opposition or invalidation proceedings in one country may directly or indirectly affect a corresponding patent or patent application in another country in an adverse manner. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors\u2019 patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Registration or Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Government Regulations\nOur business is subject to continuing regulatory oversight by the FDA and other authorities, whose requirements are costly to comply with, and our failure to comply could result in negative effects on our business.\nThe FDA has specific regulations governing human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, commonly known as \u201cHCT/Ps\u201d. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. The FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products, donor screening and testing, processing and distribution (\u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d or \u201ccGTP\u201d), labeling, record keeping, adverse-reaction reporting, inspection, and enforcement.\nWe believe SkinTE is appropriately regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and Part 1271 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., as a so-called \u201c361 HCT/P\u201d) and that, as a result, no premarket review or approval by the FDA is required. If the FDA does not agree that SkinTE meets its regulatory criteria for regulation as a 361 HCT/P, it will be regulated as a drug, device, or biological product, and we could be required to withdraw SkinTE from the market until the required clinical trials are complete and the applicable premarket regulatory clearances or approvals are obtained. Manufacturers of new drugs, biologics, and some medical devices must complete extensive clinical trials, which must be conducted pursuant to an effective IND. In addition, the FDA must review and approve a BLA or NDA before a new drug or biologic may be marketed.\nA determination by the FDA that SkinTE is not a 361 HCT/P would negatively impact our commercialization of the product and substantially increase the cost to us of regulatory compliance, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. This same risk applies to any other product we may develop that we believe should be regulated as a 361 HCT/P.\nSome of the future new products and enhancements of existing products that we expect to develop and market may not be 361 HCT/Ps, and may require premarket approval or clearance from the FDA. As a result, those product candidates would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including premarket approval or clearance. There can be no assurance, however, that approval or clearance will be granted with respect to any such products or enhancements of existing products. Such products or enhancements may encounter significant delays during FDA\u2019s premarket review process that would adversely affect our ability to market such products or enhancements.\nEven if premarket approval or clearance are obtained from the FDA, the approvals or clearances may contain substantial limitations on the indicated uses of such products and other uses may be prohibited. Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Furthermore, the FDA could limit or prevent the distribution of products, and the FDA has the power to require the recall of such products. FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect our operations. In addition, regulatory approval is subject to continuing compliance with regulatory standards, including the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) or quality system regulations and adverse event reporting regulations.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA regulations regarding our products and manufacturing processes, the FDA could initiate or take enforcement action, including, without limitation, any of the following actions or sanctions:\n\u25cf Untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, product seizures, or civil penalties;\n\u25cf Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of clinical studies, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution;\n\u25cf Orders to recall or destroy products.\n\u25cf Refusing requests for clearance or approval of new products, processes, or procedures, or for certificates or approval to enable export of the same;\n\u25cf Withdrawing or suspending current applications for approval or clearance, or any approvals or clearances already granted; and\n\u25cf Civil or criminal prosecution.\nIt is likely that the FDA\u2019s regulation of 361 HCT/Ps and other types of products (e.g., drugs, devices, or biologics) will continue to evolve in the future. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements, guidance or statutes may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While the FDA may issue new or revised guidance or regulations for 361 HCT/Ps, we do not know whether or when such revised draft or final guidance or regulations (if any) will be issued, the scope of such guidance, any new rules or regulations, whether they will apply to our technologies or products, or whether they will be advantageous or disadvantageous to us. In addition, even if it does not issue new regulations or guidance, the FDA could in the future adopt more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations or increase its enforcement activity, which may adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to comply with the regulatory guidelines set forth by the FDA with respect to our product candidates could delay or prevent the completion of market entry, clinical trials, the approval or registration of any product candidates, or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are subject to regulation and inspection by the FDA for cGTP compliance, with respect to our 361 HCT/P products. To the extent that future products we develop or enhancements of existing products we develop are not regulated as 361 HCT/Ps, we will be subject to regulation under cGMP with respect to any such product candidates that are not 361 HCT/Ps. Complying with cGTP or cGMP will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. For any products for which we are required to obtain FDA premarket approval or clearance, we must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval or clearance. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay FDA approval or clearance of our product candidates. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our product candidates. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nThe manufacture of cell and tissue-based therapy products, such as our product candidates, is highly complex and is characterized by inherent risks and challenges such as autologous raw material inconsistencies, logistical challenges, significant quality control and assurance requirements, manufacturing complexity, and significant manual processing. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy, such as most pharmaceuticals, cell and tissue-based therapy products are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials.\nAdditionally, we have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and could experience difficulties in the continued manufacturing of our product candidates, either ourselves or through third-party contractors with whom we may enter strategic relationships. Because our experience in manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution is limited, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in our efforts to efficiently manage the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of our product candidates, or have to rely on third-party contractors, over which we may not have sole control, to manufacture our product candidates. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we or any third-party contractors with whom we enter strategic relationships will be successful in streamlining manufacturing operations and implementing efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, and production standards or production volumes necessary to achieve profitability. Our failure to develop these manufacturing processes and capabilities in a timely manner could prevent us from achieving positive results of operations and cash flows.\nEven if the FDA regulates SkinTE as 361 HCT/P, we must still generate adequate substantiation for any claims we will make in our marketing. Failure to establish such adequate substantiation in the opinion of federal or state authorities could substantially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nAlthough we may not need to submit SkinTE to the FDA for premarket approval or be subject to FDA requirements for labeling or promotion of new drugs, biologics, or medical devices, we still must generate adequate substantiation for claims we make in our marketing materials. Both the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the states retain jurisdiction over the marketing of 361 HCT/Ps (and other) products in commerce and require a reasonable basis for claims made in marketing materials. Through clinical use, case studies, clinical studies, as well as other endeavors, we intend to generate such adequate substantiation for any claims we make about our products. If, however, after we commence marketing of any of our products, including SkinTE, the FTC or one or more states conclude that we lack adequate substantiation for our claims, we may be subject to significant penalties, or may be forced to alter our marketing approach in one or more jurisdictions. Any of this could materially harm our business.\nEven if SkinTE meets the criteria for a 361 HCT/P, it will be subject to ongoing regulation. We could be subject to significant penalties if we fail to comply with these requirements, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nEven if SkinTE meets the criteria for a 361 HCT/P, we are still subject to numerous post-market requirements, including those related to registration and listing, record keeping, labeling, cGTP, donor eligibility, deviation and adverse event reporting, and other activities. HCT/Ps that do not meet the definition of a 361 HCT/P are also subject to these or additional obligations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to, without limitation, warning letters, product seizures, injunctions, or civil and criminal penalties. We have established our own processing facility, which we believe is cGTP compliant. Any failure by us to maintain cGTP compliance would require remedial actions, which could potentially include actions such as delays in distribution and sales of our product, as well as enforcement actions.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs (including but not limited to capitation - the generalized cap on annual fees for a type of service or procedure such as burn or wound care or rehabilitation), and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences are not fully understood. These proposals may affect aspects of our business. We also cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nThere are numerous laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their treatments to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their treatments, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), and state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse, and there are analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, in some instances civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation. Accordingly, we could potentially face legal risks if our interpretation differs from those of enforcement authorities. Further, from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors.\nSpecifically, anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration (direct or indirect, in cash or in kind) in return for the referral, use, ordering, or recommending of the use of a product or service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs. We have entered into consulting agreements, research agreements and product development agreements with physicians, including some who may order our products or make decisions to use them. In addition, some of these physicians own our stock, which they purchased in arm\u2019s length transactions on terms identical to those offered to non-physicians, or received stock awards from us as consideration for services performed by them. While these transactions were structured with the intention of complying with all applicable laws, including state anti-referral laws and other applicable anti-kickback laws, it is possible that regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts may in the future view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or for which we would be subject to other significant civil or criminal penalties. There can be no assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view these arrangements as following applicable laws or that one or more of our employees or agents will not disregard the rules we have established. Because our strategy relies on the involvement of physicians who consult with us on the design of our products, perform clinical research on our behalf, or educate the market about the efficacy and uses of our potential products, we could be materially impacted if regulatory or enforcement agencies or courts interpret our financial relationships with physicians who refer or order our products to be in violation of applicable laws and determine that we would be unable to achieve compliance with such applicable laws. This could harm our reputation and the reputations of the physicians we engage to provide services on our behalf. In addition, the cost of noncompliance with these laws could be substantial since we could be subject to monetary fines and civil or criminal penalties, and we could also be excluded from federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for non-compliance. Further, even the costs of defending investigations of noncompliance could be substantial.\nAlso, the FCA imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties, as well as potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The FCA also allows a private individual or entity (i.e., a whistleblower) with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government and to be paid a portion of the government\u2019s recovery, which can include both civil penalties and up to three times the amount of the government\u2019s damages (usually the amount reimbursed by federal healthcare programs). The U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the government takes the position that the marketing and promotional practices of life sciences product manufacturers, including the off-label promotion of products, the provision of inaccurate or misleading reimbursement guidance, or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors or other referral sources may cause the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, by health care providers that use the manufacturer\u2019s products, which results in a violation of the FCA. In certain cases, in order to settle allegations of FCA violations, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts, and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. In addition to federal laws, some states, such as California, Massachusetts, and Vermont, mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nThe scope and enforcement of all these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change, especially considering the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. There can be no assurance that federal or state regulatory or enforcement authorities will not investigate or challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any investigation or challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any state or federal regulatory or enforcement review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether these changes are retroactive or will have effect on a going-forward basis only.\nOur access to sensitive patient information is subject to complex regulations at multiple levels and we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately protect this information.\nWe receive, maintain and utilize personal health and other confidential and sensitive data as part of the treatments we provide. We have developed a web and mobile application through which our customers can communicate with physicians and others, which may involve sharing patient identifiable health information. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity, such as the audit program implemented by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under HIPAA. International laws, rules and regulations governing the use and disclosure of such information are generally more stringent than in the United States, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws or regulations, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cybersecurity breach, and any incident involving the theft, misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by a third party, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, interrupt our operations, and damage our brand and reputation, and could also result in investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, loss of customers, litigation, or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, reputation, cash flows, and operating results.\nOur business depends on provider and patient willingness to entrust us with health related and other sensitive personal information. Events that negatively affect that trust, including incorrect or incomplete disclosure of our uses of their information, or failing to keep our information technology systems and sensitive information secure from significant attack, theft, damage, loss, or unauthorized disclosure or access, whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of third parties, could adversely affect our brand, reputation, and revenues, and also expose us to mandatory disclosure to the media, litigation (including class action litigation), and other enforcement proceedings, material fines, penalties or remediation costs, and compensatory, special, punitive, and statutory damages, consent orders, or injunctive relief, any of which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, operating results, or financial position. There can be no assurance that any such failure will not occur, or if any does occur, that we will detect it or that it can be sufficiently remediated.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ, we cannot assure you that an active, liquid trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell shares quickly or without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell your shares at all.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may not be able to resell some or all your shares at a desired price.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile during the 12-month period ended February 29, 2020, with closing stock prices ranging from a high of $16.43 per share to a low of $1.35 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for biotech companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that, at times, has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Because of this volatility, investors in our stock may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, SkinTE;\n\u25cf results and timing of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u25cf issues in manufacturing our product candidates or future approved products;\n\u25cf issues in designing or constructing our commercial manufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents, patent applications, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf public concern over our product candidates or any future approved products;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation;\n\u25cf future or anticipated sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of health care payment systems in the United States or overseas;\n\u25cf failure of any of our products or product candidates to perform safely or effectively or achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf general market conditions and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; and\n\u25cf overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets.\nIn addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Defending such litigation could result in substantial defense costs and divert the time and attention of our management, which could seriously harm our business. As discussed above under \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings,\u201d we are currently in the early stages of a stockholder class action lawsuit and, to the extent we incur substantial costs to defend or resolve that lawsuit, our ability to fund our business will be diminished, which would adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are the subject of an SEC investigation, which could result in litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions that could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.\nOn September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SEC v. Honig et al., No. 1:18-cv-01875 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)) alleging that certain persons, including John Stetson, our former Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, Barry Honig, who is also a current 5% shareholder of the Company, and Michael Brauser, who is also a current 5% shareholder of the Company, manipulated the price of securities of three public companies (none of which is PolarityTE). This complaint, which was amended on March 8, 2019 (as amended, the \u201cComplaint\u201d), alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud and other provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and SEC rules promulgated thereunder by writing, or causing to be written, false or misleading promotional articles, engaging in a variety of other manipulative trading practices as well as filing false reports of their beneficial ownership or failure to file reports of their beneficial ownership when required to do so.\nIn October 2018, we received a document request and inquiries from the SEC relating to subjects addressed in the short seller reports and cooperated fully by providing the SEC with all information relevant to their requests. On March 1, 2019, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting additional documents related to, among other things, (i) communications and agreements between us and, among others, John Stetson, Barry Honig and Michael Brauser, (ii) the transaction pursuant to which Majesco Entertainment Company acquired PolarityTE NV and our current regenerative medicine business, (iii) the performance of and communications with regulators regarding SkinTE, our lead product, and (iv) any promotion of the Company or its securities. On March 4, 2019, we obtained from the SEC a copy of the formal order of investigation of the Company and its affiliates with respect to possible violations of the federal securities laws, including, among other things, the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the Company\u2019s public disclosures, the beneficial ownership reporting provisions of the Exchange Act and the anti-price manipulation provisions of the Exchange Act. We intend to fully cooperate with the SEC regarding their March 2019 subpoena and this ongoing investigation. Since March 2019, we have received four additional subpoenas seeking documents on these and other topics. The documents and information requested in the subpoenas include materials concerning (i) the circumstances under which the Company placed Denver Lough, former Chief Executive Officer, and Naveen Krishnan, former Vice President of Analytics, on paid administrative leave, (ii) termination and separation agreements with former employees, and (iii) certain commercialization metrics included in Company disclosures. We have already provided a substantial amount of documents and information to the SEC in response to these requests and expect to make additional productions in response to the subpoenas. We met with the SEC on February 11, 2020, to review the status of the investigation and completion of the document production.\nAs a result of the SEC investigation, we could be subject to additional stockholder litigation, government inquiries or enforcement actions that could name us, our affiliates, or others. While we will not tolerate stock manipulation and will continue to report suspected wrongdoing to authorities, we cannot predict whether any of these will arise or, if they do, the possible outcomes. Stockholder litigation, government inquiries or enforcement actions could adversely affect our reputation, result in significant expenditures, including legal expenses, and potentially result in significant fines, penalties or other remedies against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance that may provide coverage for some of these expenses and costs, and we have given notice to our insurers of the claims, there is risk that the insurers will rescind or otherwise not renew the policies, that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies, or that, even if covered, our ultimate liability will exceed the available insurance.\nOur stock price may also be negatively affected by the SEC investigation, any negative press or other coverage we receive as a result thereof and the uncertainty surrounding the result of any of these developments, which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital to fund future operations, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, undermine the confidence that hospitals and doctors, key potential adopters of our products, have in us and our technology, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which would materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We expect management will continue to devote significant time, attention and resources to these matters and any additional matters that may arise, which could have a material adverse impact on our commercial development, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, certain future sales of our equity securities may trigger a downward adjustment in the exercise price of 10,638,298 common stock purchase warrants we issued in February 2020 with an original exercise price of $2.80 per share, which could apply additional pressure to depress the market price of our common stock because of the lower warrant exercise price. As of March 6, 2020, we had 38,358,450 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which, other than shares held by our directors and certain officers and affiliates, were eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we also had a significant number of securities convertible into, or allowing the purchase of, our common stock, including 4,529,988 options and rights to acquire shares of our common stock that are outstanding under our equity incentive plans, and 5,353,257 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, including our 2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. Pursuant to a Purchase Agreement that we have entered with Keystone Capital Partners, LLC (\u201cKeystone\u201d), Keystone has agreed to purchase up to $25.0 million of shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations, at our direction from time to time during the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. As of February 29, 2020, we have sold 270,502 shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement generating total gross proceeds of $725,000 and have up to $24,275,000 available for future sale under the Purchase Agreement.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated Bylaws, our Rights Agreement and Delaware law could deter a change of our management, which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf we have a classified Board requiring that members of the Board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the Board;\n\u25cf our Board is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a two-thirds vote and only for cause;\n\u25cf stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf we require all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent; and\n\u25cf stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nWe also entered into a rights agreement (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d), dated as of November 7, 2019, with Equity Stock Transfer, LLC, as rights agent. Generally, the Rights Agreement works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group (including a group of persons that are acting in concert with each other) that acquires 10% or more (or 20% or more in the case of a \u201cPassive Institutional Investor,\u201d as defined in the Rights Agreement) of our common stock without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement may be to render more difficult or discourage a tender or exchange offer or other acquisition of our common stock that is not approved by the Board. The Rights Agreement could reduce the price that stockholders might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future. Furthermore, the anti-takeover provisions of the Rights Agreement may make it more difficult to replace management even if the stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. The Rights Agreement does not prevent the Board from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of its stockholders.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nBecause we do not expect to declare cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWhile we have in the past declared and paid cash dividends on our capital stock, we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not expect to declare or pay any additional cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors in this offering.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nAs discussed in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d below, we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting through our evaluation of our controls at December 31, 2019. In 2019 we failed to execute controls relating to reconciliation procedures. In addition, we did not have a sufficient level of precision in our review procedures to detect potentially material errors in accrual and related accounts.\nA material weakness could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements requiring a restatement of the affected financial statements. A material misstatement and resulting restatement entail numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25cf We could be subject to civil litigation, including class action shareholder actions arising out of or relating to a restatement, which litigation, if decided against us, could require us to pay substantial judgments, settlements or other penalties;\n\u25cf Negative publicity relating to a restatement may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock;\n\u25cf Management\u2019s focus on achieving our business objectives may be diverted to addressing (i) the restatement (ii) customers\u2019, employees\u2019, investors\u2019 and regulators\u2019 questions and concerns regarding the restatement, (iii) any negative impact on the Company\u2019s public image with our customers and in the financial market caused by the restatement, and (iv) any subsequent litigation that may result from the restatement;\n\u25cf The SEC may review a restatement and require further amendment of our public filings; and\n\u25cf We may incur significant expenses associated with preparing and filing a restatement.\nEach of these risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management because of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we are incurring, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other costs. These costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and stock exchanges, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules also might make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management", "PERMNO": 90539, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PTE"}
