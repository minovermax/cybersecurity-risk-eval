{"cik": "28823", "company": "DIEBOLD NIXDORF, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\n(dollars and euros in millions, except for per share values)\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K because they could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The risk factors highlighted below are not the only ones the Company faces. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of these events actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be negatively affected.\nThe Company cautions the reader to keep these risk factors in mind and refrain from attributing undue certainty to any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic and Operational Risks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic creates uncertainty and could have a material adverse impact on our business. While the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations and financial results, our business has demonstrated a certain degree of resiliency in the COVID-19 pandemic given our work as an essential service provider to banks and essential retailers. Nonetheless, known or unexpected risks or developments related to the pandemic could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. If conditions worsen, resulting in additional or unexpected challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and negatively impact one or more of the following aspects of our business: our global supply chain; our manufacturing facilities; our service technicians in the field; our employees working remotely or in our offices; and the businesses of our customers. Additionally, any worsening of the pandemic could cause additional and material delays in installations, certifications or other time-sensitive aspects of our business. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continuing negative impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.\nWhile the Company has achieved significant savings from its DN Now initiatives, these savings may not be sustainable and further savings targets may be delayed or might not be fully realized, which may adversely affect its operating results and cash flow. The Company\u2019s DN Now initiatives consist of a number of work streams designed to improve operational efficiency and sustainably increase profits and cash flows. Although the Company has achieved a substantial amount of annual cost savings associated with the DN Now initiatives in 2019 and 2020 and expects to achieve further cost savings through new initiatives, such as the digital acceleration work being done with Accenture, it may be unable to sustain the annual cost savings from the work streams that it has previously implemented and may be unable to successfully implement these new work streams, which are still in the early stages, on the anticipated timeline, or at all. The Company has incurred approximately $330, in the aggregate, of cash payments related to DN Now and expects to make additional payments in 2021. In 2021, the Company intends to focus on higher free cash flow conversion and growth, despite the uncertain COVID-19 environment. If the Company is unable to achieve, or experiences any delays in achieving, the DN Now goals, or if the associated costs are higher than currently anticipated, its results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Even if the Company successfully executes these work streams and meets its DN Now goals, other factors that we cannot predict may offset the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nNew service and product developments may be unsuccessful. The Company is constantly looking to develop new services and products that complement or leverage its core competencies and expand its business potential. For example, the Company launched its DN Series banking solutions portfolio in 2019 and its DN Series EASY family of retail checkout solutions in 2021. The Company makes significant investments in service and product technologies and anticipates expending significant resources for new cloud software, digitally enabled services and product development over the next several years. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s service and product development efforts will be successful, that the roll out of any new services and products will be timely, that the customer certification process for any new products or the DN Series will be completed on the anticipated timeline, that it will be able to successfully market these services and products, or that margins generated from sales of these services and products will recover costs of development efforts.\nThe Company may not be successful executing on its digitally enabled hardware, services and software strategy. As part of its broader business strategy, the Company is delivering digitally enabled hardware, services and software to its customers to address their evolving demand for greater flexibility and optionality to meet the demands of the market, drive improvement to performance levels and provide a more scalable cost structure. The Company\u2019s digital strategy extends to its own internal capabilities, as well, to ensure the Company becomes more efficient and delivers better capabilities to its employees. Across its internal finance, information technology, human resources and sales departments, the Company is deploying digital tools to enhance its operating efficiency through the use of cloud-based applications, self-service portals and automation. Executing on a digitally enabled strategy presents risks and challenges to both the Company and its customers, and there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in its endeavors.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and make adequate capital investments. The Company\u2019s cash flows from operations depend primarily on sales and service margins. To develop new service and product technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain service and product\nquality, the Company must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, R&D, and service and product technology. In addition to cash provided from operations, the Company has from time to time utilized external sources of financing. Depending upon general market conditions or other factors, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and make adequate capital investments, either in whole or in part. In addition, any tightening of the credit markets may limit the Company's ability to obtain alternative sources of cash to fund its operations.\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity Risks.\nCybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities could disrupt the Company's internal operations or services provided to customers, which could adversely affect revenue, increase costs, and harm its reputation, customer relationships, and stock price. To reduce these risks, the Company has programs and measures in place designed to detect and help safeguard against cybersecurity attacks. Although we have implemented cybersecurity measures designed to detect and limit the risk of unauthorized access to our systems and acquisition of, loss, modification of, use, or disclosure of our data, threat actors are using evolving, sophisticated, and ever-changing techniques to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data. The types and motivations of threat actors that may attempt to access our systems also are evolving and expanding, and include sophisticated nation-state sponsored and organized cyber-criminals, who are targeting the financial services industry. As a result, the risk of cyberattack is increasing. An attack, disruption, intrusion, denial of service, theft or other data or cybersecurity incident (such as phishing attack, virus, ransomware, or other malware installation), or an inadvertent act by an employee or contractor, could result in unauthorized access to, acquisition of, loss, disclosure, or modification of, our systems, products, and data (or our third-party service provider\u2019s systems, products, and data), which may result in operational disruption, loss of business, claims (including by customers, financial institutions, cardholders, and consumers), costs and reputational harm that could negatively affect our operating results. The Company could incur significant expenses in investigating and addressing cybersecurity incidents, including the expenses of deploying additional personnel, enhancing or implementing new protection measures, training employees or hiring consultants, and such incidents could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Further, remedial measures may later prove inadequate to prevent or reduce the impact of new or emerging threats. The Company may face regulatory investigations or litigation relating to cybersecurity incidents, which may be costly to defend and which, if successful, may require the Company to pay damages and fines or change its business practices. The Company also is subject to risks associated with cyberattacks involving our supply chain. We may also detect, or may receive notice from third parties (including governmental agencies and those in our supply chain) regarding, potential vulnerabilities in our information technology systems, our products, or third-party products used in conjunction with our products. Even if these potential vulnerabilities do not affect our products, services, data, or systems, their existence or claimed existence could adversely affect customer confidence and our reputation in the marketplace, causing us to lose existing or potential customers. To the extent such vulnerabilities require remediation, such remedial measures could require significant resources, may not be implemented before such vulnerabilities are exploited, and may not prevent or reduce the risk. As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. We maintain cybersecurity insurance intended to cover some of these risks, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from future cybersecurity incidents the Company may experience.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, but none of these incidents, individually or in the aggregate, has had a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operations or products. The Company has in place various information technology protections designed to detect and reduce cybersecurity incidents, although there can be no assurance that our protections will be successful. The Company also regularly evaluates its protections against cybersecurity incidents, including through self-assessments and third-party assessments, and takes steps to enhance those protections, in response to specific threats and as part of the Company\u2019s information security program. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to prevent or remediate all future cybersecurity incidents or that the cost associated with responding to any such incident or impact of such incident will not be significant or material.\nPortions of the Company's IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. The Company may not be successful in implementing new systems, and transitioning data and other aspects of the process could be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact the ability to fulfill orders, service customers and interrupt other processes and, in addition, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Delayed sales, lower margins, lost customers or diminished investor confidence resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect the Company's financial results, stock price and reputation.\nPrivacy and information security laws are complex, and if the Company fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, the Company may be subject to government or private actions relating to privacy and security incidents and breaches, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations or materially harm its reputation. The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in Europe, the U.S. and other jurisdictions that involve matters central to its business, including privacy, information security, data protection, competition, and consumer protection. The Company, and the personal information and other data that it processes, are increasingly subject to these laws, which are increasingly complex and stringent as the global data protection landscape evolves. These laws may conflict with one another, and many of them are subject to frequent modification and differing interpretations. Complying with these evolving and varying standards could require significant expense and effort and may require us to change our business practices or the functionality of our products and services in a manner adverse to our customers and our business. In addition, violations of these laws can result in significant\nfines, penalties, claims by regulators or other third parties, imposition of limits on the processing of data, and damage to our brand and business.\nThe Company is subject to, among other data and consumer protection laws, the GDPR, the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law. Costs to comply with these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant and could materially affect our business and failure to comply with them could result in material legal exposure and business impact. For example, the GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations on companies, with penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 euros or four percent of annual global revenue, and grants corrective powers to supervisory authorities including the ability to impose a limit on processing of personal data. Following the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, it is likely that the data protection obligations of the GDPR will continue to apply to U.K.-based organizations\u2019 processing of personal data in substantially unvaried form at least in the short term. There are legislative proposals recently adopted or currently pending in the United States, at both the federal and state levels (including by banking agencies), as well as in other jurisdictions, implementing new or additional requirements on data processing that could increase compliance costs, the cost and complexity of delivering our services and significantly affect our business.\nTransferring personal information across international borders is complex and subject to legal and regulatory requirements, as well as active litigation and enforcement in a number of jurisdictions around the world, each of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data as part of our business operations. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g., Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are the subject of recent judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union resulting in the invalidation of Privacy Shield. The invalidation of Privacy Shield and the open questions related to the validity of Model Clauses have resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide our services in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including India, have also established or are considering data localization requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. These restrictions could have a substantial impact on the cost of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful. The Company's ability to make scheduled payments or refinance its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. The Company may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness.\nIf the Company's cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow the Company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of the Company's existing or future debt arrangements may restrict it from effecting any of these alternatives.\nThe terms of the credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) governing the Company's revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility)and term loans and the indentures governing the Company's senior secured and unsecured notes (the Indentures) restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. The Credit Agreement and the Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and may limit its ability to engage in acts that may be in its long-term best interest, including restrictions on its ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses the Company conducts;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. Although the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement in August 2018 to, among other things, revise certain of its financial covenants, upon the occurrence of certain events, the financial covenants,\nincluding the Company\u2019s net leverage ratio, will revert to pre-amendment levels. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control, and it may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under any of the Indentures or under the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the Revolving Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if the Company were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Revolving Facility and term loans, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted them to secure that indebtedness. In the event the Company\u2019s lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of its indebtedness, the Company and its subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may be:\n\u2022limited in how it conducts its business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; and\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect the ability to grow in accordance with its strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s financial results, its substantial indebtedness and its credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of its financing.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet its debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s high level of indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and liquidity. The Company\u2019s level of indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022make it more difficult for the Company to pay or refinance its debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because the Company may not have sufficient cash flows to make its scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022cause the Company to use a larger portion of its cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D and other business activities;\n\u2022limit the Company\u2019s ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n\u2022cause the Company to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022cause the Company\u2019s suppliers to limit trade credit, require pre-payments or other collateral;\n\u2022cause the Company to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage;\n\u2022result in a downgrade in the credit rating of the Company or indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries, which could increase the cost of borrowings; and\n\u2022limit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, R&D and other business activities.\nThe Company may also incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would increase its total indebtedness. Although the Credit Agreement and the Indentures contain restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If the Company and its restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional debt, the related risks that the Company faces could intensify.\nThe interest rates of certain debt instruments are priced using a spread over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and Euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR). LIBOR and EURIBOR are the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and EURO interbank market, and are widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. LIBOR and EURIBOR are the reference rates used with respect to the term loans and Revolving Facility under the Credit Agreement. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. At this time, it is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new standards of calculating LIBOR will be established. The Company has taken steps to reduce its risk of a higher interest rate by effectively replacing LIBOR as the reference rate with respect to its debt, including by entering into interest rate swaps. Additionally, in July 2020, the Company refinanced a portion of its then outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement using the net proceeds of newly issued senior secured notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate. Despite the Company\u2019s mitigation efforts, the discontinuation of LIBOR may increase the Company\u2019s interest expense on loans using LIBOR as a reference rate and adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments.\nWorkforce Operations Risks.\nAn inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees could harm current and future operations. In order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, professional, administrative, technical, sales, marketing and IT support positions. It also must keep employees focused on its strategies and goals. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to its\nfuture, and competition for experienced employees in these areas can be intense. The failure to hire or loss of key employees could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Performance of Third Parties.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to deliver products that satisfy customer requirements is dependent on the performance of its subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components. The Company relies on other companies, including subcontractors and suppliers, to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies and production commodities included in, or used in the production of, its products. If one or more of the Company's subcontractors or suppliers experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, it may be unable to meet commitments to its customers or incur additional costs. In some instances, the Company depends upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier\u2019s control, such as geo-political developments or public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19), or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to meet commitments to its customers or increase its operating costs. Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses. At present, the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to predict, but it may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s overall business, financial condition and results of operations, in particular if COVID-19 infection rates resurge in other countries and regions.\nThe Company manufactures a substantial amount of its products in Paderborn, Germany, and Manaus, Brazil. In addition, certain of our products are manufactured in China. Any damage suffered by these critical locations and manufacturing plants could negatively impact our business and results of operations. While the Company maintains insurance policies that provide coverage up to certain limits for some of the potential risks and liabilities associated with its business, it does not maintain insurance policies for all risks and liabilities.\nThe Company relies on third parties to provide security systems and systems integration. Sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the Company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that could impede sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nTax Liability Risks.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect the Company's future profitability. The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. If the Company decides to repatriate cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments residing in international tax jurisdictions, there could be further negative impact on foreign and domestic taxes. The Company's tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could affect the valuation of its net deferred tax assets. The Company's future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns continuing assessments of its income tax exposures and changes in tax legislation. For example, President Biden has proposed the reversal or modification of some portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which, if enacted, could result in a higher U.S. corporate income tax rate than is currently in effect.\nAdditionally, the Company's future results could be adversely affected by the results of indirect tax audits and examinations, and continuing assessments of its indirect tax exposures. A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire. It is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter or other open years, which could be material to its financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Divestitures and Alliances.\nThe Company may not be successful executing potential acquisitions, investments or partnerships, or divesting its non-core and/or non-accretive businesses. As the Company\u2019s financial performance improves it may evaluate and consider acquisitions, investments or partnerships in companies, products, services and technologies which could support the Company\u2019s strategy and growth. Acquisitions, investments and partnerships inherently involve risks, which may include: the risk of integrating business operations, cultures, retaining key personnel and maintaining appropriate systems and controls; the potential for unknown liabilities; the possibility that acquisitions, investments or partnerships may not yield the targeted financial or strategic benefits to the Company. Furthermore, the Company has, from time-to-time, been divesting certain non-core and/or non-accretive businesses to, among other things, simplify its business and reduce its debt. However, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in selling all or further such any assets. It may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and\nevaluating potential sales. The process of exploring any sales may be time consuming and disruptive to its business operations, and if it is unable to effectively manage the process, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. It also cannot assure that any potential sale, if consummated, will prove to be beneficial to its shareholders. Any potential sale would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in the assets and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nIn addition, while it evaluates asset sales, the Company is exposed to risks and uncertainties, including potential difficulties in retaining and attracting key employees, distraction of its management from other important business activities, and potential difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers, lenders, sureties and other third parties, all of which could harm its business.\nThe Company may be unable to successfully and effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, and other significant transactions, which could harm its operating results, business and prospects. As the Company improves its financial performance and promotes its business strategy, it will continue to engage in discussions and potentially enter into agreements with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, partnerships, divestitures and outsourcing arrangements. Such transactions present significant risks and challenges and there can be no assurances that the Company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. Acquisitions and partnerships inherently involve risks.\nThe Company may specifically evaluate and consider investments or partnerships in companies, products, services and technologies. Related risks include the Company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated benefits or timing of a transaction or contractual obligations. Such transactions may require the Company to manage post-closing transitions services or integration issues with business operations, support systems, workplace cultures and the retention of personnel. There is also the potential for unknown liabilities and the possibility that the acquisitions or partnerships may not yield financial strategic benefits to the Company. Risks of these transactions can be more pronounced in larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously.\nRisks Related to Our Pension Plan Obligations.\nLow investment performance by the Company's pension plan assets may result in an increase to its net pension liability and expense, which may require it to fund a portion of its pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses. The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees across the globe. The Company's pension expense and required contributions to its pension plans funded with assets are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions it uses to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nA significant market downturn could occur in future periods resulting in a decline in the funded status of the Company's pension plans and causing actual asset returns to be below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense. If return on plan assets in future periods perform below expectations, future pension expense will increase.\nRisks Related to Shareholder Appraisal Proceedings.\nThe Company is exposed to additional litigation risk and uncertainty with respect to the former minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG. As a result of the 2016 acquisition of Diebold Nixdorf AG (the Acquisition), the Company continues to be exposed to two separate appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren). Both proceedings are pending at the same Chamber for Commercial Matters (Kammer f\u00fcr Handelssachen) at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany). The first appraisal proceeding relates to the Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement (DPLTA) entered into by Diebold Holding Germany Inc. & Co. KGaA (now doing business as Diebold Nixdorf Holding Germany GmbH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated, and Diebold Nixdorf AG, which became effective on February 17, 2017. The DPLTA appraisal proceeding was filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of both the cash exit compensation of \u20ac55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which 6.9 million shares were then outstanding) and the annual recurring compensation of \u20ac2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA.\nThe second appraisal proceeding relates to the cash merger squeeze-out of minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG in 2019. The squeeze-out appraisal proceeding was filed by former minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of the cash exit compensation of \u20ac54.80 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which 1.4 million shares were then outstanding) in connection with the merger squeeze-out.\nIn both appraisal proceedings, a court ruling would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time when the DPLTA or the merger squeeze-out, respectively, became effective. Any cash compensation received by former Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders in connection with the merger squeeze-out would be netted with any higher cash compensation such shareholder may still claim in connection with the DPLTA appraisal proceeding. While the Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA and the merger squeeze-out was in both cases fair, it notes that German courts often adjudicate increases of the cash compensation to plaintiffs in varying amounts in connection with German appraisal proceedings. Therefore, the Company cannot rule out that the first instance court or an appellate court may increase the cash compensation also in these appraisal proceedings. The Company, however, is convinced that its defense in both appraisal\nproceedings, which are still at preliminary stages, is supported by strong sets of facts and the Company vigorously defends itself in these matters.\nNon-Cash Impairment Loss Risks.\nThe Company has a significant amount of long-term assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and any future impairment charges could adversely impact its results of operations. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference. Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $800.4 of goodwill. The techniques used in its qualitative and quantitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change. Although the Company believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecast at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.\nEconomic Risks and Market Contingencies.\nThe proliferation of payment options other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, store-valued cards and mobile payment options could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of ATMs. The U.S., Europe and other developed markets have seen a shift in consumer payment trends since the late 1990's, with more customers now opting for electronic forms of payment, such as credit cards and debit cards, for their in-store purchases over traditional paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated consumer transition towards non-cash payment alternatives driving an increase in digital, mobile and contactless payment methods. Additionally, some merchants offer free cash back at the POS for customers that utilize debit cards for their purchases, thus providing an additional incentive for consumers to use these cards. The continued growth in electronic payment methods could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and ultimately, a decline in the usage of ATMs. New payment technology and adoption of mobile payment technology, virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, or other new payment method preferences by consumers could further reduce the general population's need or demand for cash and negatively impact sales of ATMs and selected products, services and software.\nThe Company's business may be affected by general economic conditions, cyclicality and uncertainty and could be adversely affected during economic downturns. Demand for the Company's services and products is affected by general economic conditions and the business conditions of the industries in which it sells its services and products. The business of most of the Company's customers, particularly its financial institution and retail customers, is, to varying degrees, cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of the Company's services and products. This risk is magnified for capital goods purchases such as ATMs, retail systems and physical security products. In addition, downturns in the Company's customers\u2019 industries, even during periods of strong general economic conditions, could adversely affect the demand for the Company's services and products, and its sales and operating results.\nIn particular, continuing economic difficulties in the global markets have led to an economic recession in certain markets in which the Company operates. As a result of these difficulties and other factors, including new or increased regulatory burdens, financial institutions and retail customers have failed and may continue to fail, resulting in a loss of current or potential customers, or deferred or canceled orders, including orders previously placed. Any customer deferrals or cancellations could materially affect the Company's sales and operating results.\nIncreased energy, raw material and labor costs could reduce the Company's operating results. Energy prices, particularly petroleum prices, and raw materials (e.g. steel) are cost drivers for the Company's business. In recent years, the price of petroleum has been highly volatile, particularly due to the unstable political conditions in the Middle East and increasing international demand from emerging markets. During his campaign, President Biden stated his intent to reverse U.S. climate change policy and in one of his first actions after taking office, signed an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. New legislation and regulations designed to implement this shift in U.S. climate change strategy, such as President Biden\u2019s proposed ban of new oil and gas production activities on public lands and properties, could cause fuel and electricity prices to increase. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases that may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may continue to increase cost of operations and effect the Company\u2019s ability to operate in specific markets. Any increase in the costs of energy would also increase the Company's transportation costs.\nThe primary raw materials in the Company's services, software and systems solutions are steel, plastics, and electronic parts and components. The majority of raw materials are purchased from various local, regional and global suppliers pursuant to supply contracts. However, the price of these materials can fluctuate under these contracts in tandem with the pricing of raw materials. Current price increases in steel and resin are being mitigated by long term contracts and joint work with suppliers on general\nproductivity improvement and supply chain optimization. Most supplier agreements include long term productivity improvements that serve as the basis for absorbing the potential raw materials increases.\nThe Company cannot assure that its labor costs going forward will remain competitive or will not increase. In the future, the Company's labor agreements may be amended, or become amendable, and new agreements could have terms with higher labor costs. In addition, labor costs may increase in connection with the Company's growth. The Company may also become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future in the event that non-unionized workers may unionize.\nRisks Related to Competition.\nThe Company faces competition in global markets that could adversely affect its sales and financial condition. All phases of the Company's business are highly competitive. Some of its services and products are in direct competition with similar or alternative services or products provided by its competitors. The Company encounters competition in price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition and quality. In a number of international markets in each region where the Company operates, it faces substantial competition from local service providers that offer competing services and products.\nLocal providers of competing services and products may also have a substantial advantage in attracting customers in their countries due to more established branding in that country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of customers residing in that country and/or their focus on a single market. In addition, some of these companies may have a dominant market share in their territories and may be owned by local stakeholders. Because of the potential for consolidation in any market, the Company's competitors may become larger, which could make them more efficient and permit them to be more price-competitive. Increased size could also permit them to operate in wider geographic areas and enhance their abilities in other areas such as R&D and customer service.\nThe Company expects that its competitors will continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced services and products. This could cause a decline in market acceptance of the Company's services and products or result in the loss of major customers. In addition, the Company's competitors could cause a reduction in the prices for some of its services and products as a result of intensified price competition. Also, the Company may be unable to effectively anticipate and react to new entrants in the marketplace competing with its services and products.\nAs a U.S.-based multi-national corporation, the Company must ensure its compliance with both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements, while local competitors only need to observe applicable regional, national or local laws that may be less onerous. An inability to compete successfully could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition and cash flows in any given period.\nRisks Related to Our Multi-National Business Operations.\nBecause the Company's operations are conducted worldwide, they are affected by risks of doing business abroad. The Company generates a significant percentage of revenue from operations conducted outside the U.S. Revenue from international operations amounted to approximately 75.0 percent in 2020, 76.8 percent in 2019, and 77.1 percent in 2018 of total revenue during these respective years.\nAccordingly, international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly in EMEA (primarily the euro), Great Britain (pound sterling), Mexico (peso), Thailand (baht) and Brazil (real);\n\u2022transportation and supply chain delays and interruptions;\n\u2022political and economic instability and disruptions, including the impact of trade agreements;\n\u2022the failure of foreign governments to abide by international agreements and treaties;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds and capital controls;\n\u2022the imposition of duties, tariffs and other taxes;\n\u2022import and export controls;\n\u2022changes in governmental policies and regulatory environments;\n\u2022ensuring the Company's compliance with U.S. laws and regulations and applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, and applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022increasingly complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including the GDPR;\n\u2022labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022the uncertainty of product acceptance by different cultures;\n\u2022the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing strategic alliances with foreign partners;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022limitations on the ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including repatriation of profits; and\n\u2022disruptions in our business, or the businesses of our suppliers or customers, due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19), fires or other natural disasters.\nAny of these events could have an adverse effect on the Company's international operations by reducing the demand for its services and products or decreasing the prices at which it can sell its services and products, thereby adversely affecting its financial condition or operating results. The Company may not be able to continue to operate in compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which it may be subject. In addition, these laws or regulations may be modified in the future, and the Company may not be able to operate in compliance with those modifications.\nSignificant developments from recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies, trade policies of other countries, or the issuance of sanctions forbidding or restricting trade where the Company has operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs, and other governmental action relating to international trade agreements or policies, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the requirement for licenses or the occurrence of a trade war, may adversely impact demand for the Company\u2019s products, costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to select a preferred supplier and, as a result, adversely impact its business.\nThe U.S. government may renegotiate, or potentially terminate, existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries, including countries such as China. The Company manufactures a substantial amount of its products in China. Additional tariffs may cause the Company to increase prices to its customers, which may reduce demand, or, if it is unable to increase prices, result in lowering its margin on products sold. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s global operations, including in China and Russia, subject it to sanctions laws in the countries where it trades and to U.S. sanctions. If additional sanctions are imposed this may require the Company to reduce or exit its business in a country.\nIt remains unclear what the U.S. or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to sanctions, tariffs, international trade agreements and policies on a short-term or long-term basis. The Company cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on its business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company. Certain provisions of the Company's charter documents, including provisions limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice, may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the Company's board of directors and may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the Company's control or management. This could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common shares. Additionally, Ohio corporate law provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed control share acquisition, as defined in the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). Assuming compliance with the prescribed notice and information filings, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if, at a special meeting of shareholders, the acquisition is approved by both a majority of its voting power represented at the meeting and a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the interested shares, as defined in the ORC. The application of these provisions of the ORC also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of dividends is at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors. Although the Company has paid dividends on its common shares in the past, the declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s board of directors. The amount and size of any future dividends will depend on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors.\nGeneral Risks.\nThe Company's ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow it to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause its financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of its common shares. The Company requires effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the Company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, its financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of its common shares.\nIf the Company is not able to maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, its business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial statements. As a result, the Company's ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and\nadversely affected. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and the market value of its securities and require it to incur additional costs to improve its internal control systems and procedures. In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts and others could also be adversely affected.\nAn adverse determination that the Company's services, products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or its failure to enforce its intellectual property rights could have a materially adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. As is common in any high technology industry, others have asserted from time to time, and may assert in the future, that the Company's services, products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. A court determination that its services, products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require it to make material changes to its services, products and/or manufacturing processes.\nThe Company also seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights against infringement. The Company cannot predict the outcome of actions to enforce its intellectual property rights, and, although it seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it cannot guarantee that it will be successful in doing so. Any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe Company may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA or other worldwide anti-bribery laws, which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company is subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including worldwide anti-bribery laws. Anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies, and third parties acting on their behalf, from engaging in bribery or making or receiving other improper payments to another person or entity, including government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage or inducing a person to act improperly or rewarding them for doing so. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.\nThe Company's employees and agents are required to comply with these laws. The Company operates in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree, and strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Non-US companies, including some that may compete with the Company, may not be subject to the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws and may follow local customs and practices. Accordingly, such companies may be more likely to engage in activities prohibited by the anti-bribery laws which apply to the Company, which could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's ability to compete for business in such countries.\nDespite the Company's commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics, it cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by its employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company's business and result in financial penalties, debarment from government contracts and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Future changes in anti-bribery or economic sanctions laws and enforcement could also result in increased compliance requirements and related expenses that may also have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom's (U.K.) exit from the EU could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. The U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU (Brexit) and the resulting significant change to the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU and with countries outside the EU (and the laws, regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them) could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the U.K. and the EU and negatively impact the Company\u2019s European operations. The U.K. and the EU entered into a withdrawal agreement that set out the terms governing the U.K.\u2019s departure, including, among other things, a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020, to allow for a future trade deal to be agreed upon. Although it is unknown what the terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that Brexit will result in the Company\u2019s EU operations becoming subject to materially different, and potentially conflicting, laws, regulations or tariffs, which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact the Company's financial performance and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase the Company's cost of doing business and restrict its ability to operate its business or execute its strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible increase in U.S. corporate income tax rates, legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to climate change and environmental policy and other changes relating to the Biden Administration transition, compliance costs and enforcement under applicable securities laws, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) and Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 16, 2014, as well as costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nThe Company\u2019s actual operating results may differ significantly from its guidance. From time to time, the Company releases guidance, including any guidance that it may include in the reports that it files with the SEC regarding its future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by its management and is qualified by, and subject to,\nthe assumptions and the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as the factors described under \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Forward-Looking Statement Disclosure.\u201d The Company\u2019s guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither its independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that the Company releases such data is to provide a basis for its management to discuss its business outlook with analysts and investors. The Company does not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by the Company will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.", "PERMNO": 40440, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "DBD"}
