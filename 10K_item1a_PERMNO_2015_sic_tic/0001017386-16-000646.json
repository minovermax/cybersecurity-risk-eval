{"cik": "90721", "company": "PERVASIP CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks below, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our business. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nI. Risks Related To Our Financial Condition\nOur business will not be viable unless we obtain significant amounts of additional capital.\nAt November 30, 2015 we had $8,978 in cash and $7,183 in accounts receivable, balanced against $1,622,649 in accounts payable and many millions in debt. It is unlikely that we can sustain current operations, and it is impossible that we can expand current operation, unless we obtain additional capital. Because of our poor financial condition, it will be very difficult to obtain additional capital. If we fail to do so, it is likely that our business will fail and our shareholders will lose most or all of their investment in our company.\nOur negative net worth will make it unlikely that we can obtain conventional financing for our business during the forseeable future.\nConventional financing generally consists of debt secured by assets or of equity financing. At the present time, we have secured debt outstanding in amounts that far exceed the book value of our assets. We also have a shareholders\u2019 deficit that is approximately 19 times the book value of our assets - which means that our company has no equity. For those reasons, we will not be able to obtain conventional financing unless and until these conditions are substantially alleviated, which is unlikely to happen in the near future. Until then, the only financing that will be available to us will involve the sale of securities convertible into common stock at floating rates, so that our investors can liquidate their investment by selling into the market for our common stock. Our ability to obtain such financing will depend on the continued liquidity of the market for our common stock. If the trading volume in the market for our common stock diminishes, we may be unable to attract investors of any kind, in which case our business would be likely to fail for want of capital resources.\nThe $3,832,659 in debt that we owe to our lenders will add high interest expenses to our statement of operations, which will make it difficult for us to report profits.\nDuring the year ended November 30, 2015 we recorded $1,414,029 in interest expense, or 234% of our revenues in that period. During the year ended November 30, 2014, we recorded $1,838,375 in interest expense, or 374% of our revenues for the year. At November 30, 2015 we had $3,832,659 in debt on our balance sheet, before taking into consideration any debt discounts. That debt, until it is satisfied, will result in interest expense in amounts that far exceed our current revenue level. This situation will make it difficult for us to realize net income in the coming periods (except for net income that may occasionally result from changes in the value of our outstanding derivative liabilities). And, in turn, our inability to report net income will make it difficult for us to obtain capital financing that might replace the high interest debt on our balance sheet.\nThe debt agreements governing our financing contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business\nIn October 2015 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP, which is the Selling Security Holder in this offering. Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, we sold to TCA a secured convertible debenture in the principal amount of $500,000. The Securities Purchase Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to enter into specified types of transactions. These covenants will prevent us from undertaking, without the consent of TCA, transactions of the following nature:\n\u00b7 merger or consolidation;\n\u00b7 grant of liens on our assets;\n\u00b7 sale or disposal of assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u00b7 consummation of acquisitions;\n\u00b7 investments; or\n\u00b7 payment of dividends or other distributions.\nThese covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we consider to be in the Company's best interests and in the interest of its shareholders, but that TCA does not perceive to be in its own interest. In addition, we are in default of our lending agreement with TCA.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends and investors should not buy our common stock expecting to receive dividends.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past, and do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors will only realize an economic gain on their investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. Investors should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading, investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nII. Risks Related To Our Business Operations\nWe have a limited operating history and operate in a new industry, and we may not succeed.\nWe have a limited operating history in our current line of business. We are subject to all risks inherent in a developing business enterprise. Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. For example, the recreational and medical marijuana industry is a new industry that as a whole may not succeed, particularly should the Federal government change course and decide to prosecute those dealing in medical and recreational marijuana in violation of Federal law. If that happens, the market for our products and services would be likely to disappear.\nSince we participate in a new industry, there are no established entities whose business model we can follow or build on the success of. Similarly, there is limited information about comparable companies available for potential investors to review in making a decision about whether to invest in Pervasip. Further, as the medical and recreational marijuana industry is a new market, it is ripe for technological advancements that could limit or eliminate the need for our services and products.\nYou should consider, among other factors, the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies that, like Pervasip, are in their early stages. For example, unanticipated expenses, problems, and technical difficulties may occur and they may result in material delays in the operation of our business, in particular with respect to our services and products. We may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our capital stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment.\nThe long term success of our business will depend on our ability to develop new technologies for the cannabis industry.\nPervasip will only be successful as a vehicle for public investment if we are able to achieve a market position that generates substantial profits. Our plan to achieve that market position is based on our ambition to develop technologies that will enhance the profitablity of our clients in the cannabis industry. We are active in developing those technologies; but the success of our development efforts is by no means assured. Moreover, any new products or services that we develop and offer to the industry may be subject to significant competition from offerings by new and existing competitors in the legal cannabis industry. In addition, new products, services and enhancements may pose a variety of technical challenges and require us to attract additional qualified employees. The failure to successfully develop and market these new products, services or enhancements could prevent Pervasip from becoming profitable.\nOur computer systems and operations may be vulnerable to security breaches.\nWe expect that the cloud-based monitoring systems offered by our subsidiary, Canalytix, to the cannabis industry will be an important foundation for establishing our company as a leading source of technology for that industry. For that reason, among others, the safety of our network and our secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet will be essential to our operations and our services. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our network and the consumer information stored on our network, our network and our computer infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to physical breaches or to the introduction of computer viruses, abuse of use and similar disruptive problems and security breaches that could cause loss (both economic and otherwise), interruptions, delays or loss of services to our users. We rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. It is possible, however, that advances in computer capabilities or new technologies could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect user transaction data. A party that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruptions in our operations or utilize our network without authorization. Security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation and possible liability. While we have experienced isolated instances of unauthorized use of our network, and have responded to such events by taking steps to increase our network security, we cannot guarantee you that our security measures will prevent future security breaches.\nThird parties might infringe upon our technology.\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our property rights will prevent misappropriation of our technology. To protect our rights to our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, strategic partners and others. However, we may be unable to detect inappropriate use of our technology. Moreover, in the event of misappropriation, we may lack the financial resources necessary to successfully prosecute an enforcement action. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could materially harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our technology rights could result in significant financial expenses and managerial resources.\nThird parties may claim that our services infringe upon their intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that we have violated a patent or infringed a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them and subject us to expensive and disruptive litigation. We incorporate licensed technology in some of our products and services. In these license agreements, the licensors have agreed to indemnify us with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right so long as we have not made changes to the licensed software. We cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect us from infringement claims. Any infringement claims and lawsuits, even if not meritorious, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; divert management\u2019s attention and resources; require us to redesign our products and services, if feasible; require us to pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and/or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business.\nWe may face difficulties related to entry into joint ventures or the future acquisition or integration of additional businesses, which could harm our growth or operating results\nBecause we have entered into an industry that is rapidly developing, it is crucual to our future success that we keep pace with the growth. Toward that end, we will be aggressively pursuing opportunities to enter into joint venture arrangements with other industry participants or to acquire additional businesses or assets. Any such events will require substantial management time and resources, which may distract from our core operations to their detriment. In addition, acquisitions of existing businesses involve substantial risks, including the risk that we may not be able to integrate the operations, personnel, services, or technologies, the potential disruption of our ongoing businesses, the diversion of management attention, the maximization of financial and strategic opportunities, the difficulty in developing or maintaining controls and procedures, and the dilution to our existing stockholders from the issuance of additional shares of common stock. As a result of these and other risks, we may not produce anticipated revenue, profitability, or synergies.\nBecause of our limited financial resources, acquisitions will likely require us to issue equity securities. Such transactions often result in significant expenses, such as the amortization of intangibles, write-down of goodwill, and write-off of acquisition-related expenses. If we are unable to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisition. In addition, we cannot predict market reactions to any acquisitions we may make.\nWhile we conduct due diligence in connection with acquisition and joint venture opportunities, there will be a risk that such due diligence efforts fail to discover undisclosed liabilities or that we inadequately assess known liabilities. The discovery of material liabilities associated with acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, economic risks faced by joint venture partners, or any failure of joint venture partners to perform their obligations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nEven if we are successful in expanding our operations in the United States, as planned, we may experience periods of rapid growth, which will require additional resources. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. In addition, we will need to expand the scope of our infrastructure and our physical resources. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIII. Risks Relating To Our Industry\nOur success will be dependent on additional states legalizing medical and recreational marijuana.\nContinued development of the medical and recreational marijuana market is dependent upon continued legislative authorization of marijuana at the state level. Any number of factors could slow or halt the progress. Further, progress is not assured and the process can be expected to encounter set-backs. Even in states where there is public support for a legislative proposal, key support must be created in the relevant legislative committee or a bill may never advance to a vote. Numerous factors can interfere with success in the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt the progress and adoption of marijuana for recreational and medical purposes, which would limit the market for our products and negatively impact our business and revenues.\nMarijuana remains illegal under federal law. Even in those jurisdictions in which the use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, its use and prescription are violations of federal law, which may disrupt the on going business of Pervasip.\nPossession and distribution of marijuana remain illegal under federal law. Marijuana is a schedule-I controlled substance. Even in those jurisdictions in which the use of medical and recreational marijuana have been legalized at the state level, its possession, prescription or distributions remains a violation of federal law. The United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 Coop. and Gonzales v. Raich that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical and recreational purposes, notwithstanding state or local de-regulation. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana trumps state laws that legalize its use for medicinal purposes. At present, certain states are decriminalizing possession of marijuana, either for medical use or in general. This may be because the Obama administration made a policy decision to allow states to implement these laws and not prosecute anyone operating in accordance with applicable state law. However, we faced another presidential election cycle in 2016, and a new administration could introduce a less favorable policy. A change in the federal attitude towards enforcement could cripple the industry. The legal cannabis industry is our target market, and if this industry is unable to operate, we would lose the majority of our potential clients, which would have a negative impact on our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur subsidiaries may have difficulty accessing the service of banks, which may make it difficult to conduct our business operations.\nAs discussed above, the distribution of marijuana is illegal under federal law. Therefore, there is a compelling argument that banks cannot accept for deposit funds from the legal cannabis industry, and therefore cannot do business with the Company. While efforts are underway in the U.S. Congress to amend banking regulations and laws in order to allow banks to transact business with state-authorized medical and recreational marijuana businesses, there can be no assurance these legislative efforts will be successful, that banks will agree to do business with medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industry participants, or that in the absence of legislation state and federal banking regulators will not strictly enforce current prohibitions on banks handling funds generated from an activity that is illegal under federal law. If we are unable to open accounts and otherwise use the service of banks, the result could be a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nPervasip may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry, and such change may increase costs and competition that may adversely affect our business.\nRapidly changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards characterize the Company\u2019s market. The continued growth of the Internet and intense competition in the Company\u2019s industry exacerbate these market characteristics. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of its products and services. The Company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of its products and services. In addition, any new enhancements must meet the requirements of its current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance. The Company could also incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its products and services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes.\nThe Company also expects that new competitors may introduce products, systems or services that are directly or indirectly competitive with the Company. These competitors may succeed in developing, products, systems and services that have greater functionality or are less costly than the Company\u2019s products, systems and services, and may be more successful in marketing such products, systems and services. Technological changes have lowered the cost of operating communications and computer systems and purchasing software. These changes reduce the Company\u2019s cost of providing services but also facilitate increased competition by reducing competitors\u2019 costs in providing similar services. This competition could increase price competition and reduce anticipated profit margins.\nThe cannabis industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete.\nWe are involved in a highly competitive industry where we will compete with numerous other companies that offer alternative methods or approaches, that may have far greater resources, more experience, and personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or products that make our products obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these other entities.\nIV. Risks Related To Our Management\nOur Series E preferred shareholder has voting control of our company and has the ability to exercise control over all matters submitted to a stockholder vote.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Paul Riss, currently owns 10 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, which gives him 51% of the voting power at any meeting of our shareholders or if shareholder consents are collected. He is therefore able to control the outcome of any matter submitted to the shareholders for approval, which would include the election of directors, recapitalizations, mergers or other significant corporate transactions.\nTCA may obtain voting control of the Company and exercise it for its own purposes.\nIn October 2015 the Company sold a $500,000 promissory note to TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP. The Note matures in April 2017 and bears interest at 18% per annum. In connection with the sale of the Note, the Company issued to TCA Series J Preferred Stock. The certificate that created the Series J Preferred Stock provides that, if the Company incurs a default under the terms of the Note, TCA may declare its rights as a holder of Series J Preferred Stock effective. Those rights include the right to exercise voting control of the Company. The Company has defaulted under the Note, and accordingly, TCA could take control of the Company. It is possible that TCA would use that control to protect its investment in the Company in ways that may not be in the best interests of the other shareholders of the Company.\nBecause we are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures, our shareholders have limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rule changes proposed and enacted by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities which are listed on the New York Stock Exchanges or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions and because we chose to avoid incurring the substantial additional costs associated with such compliance any sooner than necessary, we have not yet adopted these measures.\nBecause none of our directors is independent, we do not currently have independent audit or compensation committees. This situation means that the Board will determine the direction of our company with only limited contribution of insights from outside observers with an objective perspective. This may limit the quality of the decisions that are made. In addition, the members of our board who are also officers have the ability, among other things, to determine their own levels of compensation. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our shareholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters and investors may be reluctant to provide us with funds necessary to expand our operations.\nWe depend upon key personnel, the loss of which could seriously harm our business.\nOur operating performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and key employees. In particular, Dr. Kenneth Hughes, our Chief Science Officer, possesses valuable knowledge about and experience in extraction technologies and patent applications. We have not entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Hughes and, although we are considering doing so, have not acquired key-person life insurance on him or any of our executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of Dr.Hughes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, as well as the value of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to attract, train, or retain highly qualified personnel could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends on the Company\u2019s ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, specifically those with management and product development skills. In particular, the Company must hire additional skilled personnel to further the Company\u2019s research and development efforts. Competition for such personnel is intense. If the Company does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating the Company\u2019s current personnel, the Company\u2019s business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we will not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital.\nWe currently have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. Additionally, there is a lack of formal process and timeline for closing the books and records at the end of each reporting period. Such weaknesses restrict the Company\u2019s ability to timely gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements.\nBecause of the Company\u2019s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. There is inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company\u2019s management is composed of a small number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation we would need to hire additional staff. Currently, the Company is unable to hire additional staff to facilitate greater segregation of duties but will continue to reassess its capabilities as it gains access to additional capital.\nV. Risks Related To Ownership Of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will continue to be adversely affected by our outstanding convertible debentures.\nSeveral third-party investors currently hold convertible debentures issued by the Company that allow them to convert principal and interest into shares of our common stock at conversion prices that approximate a 30% to 60% discount to the trading price of our common stock. At November 30, 2015, the balance of the convertible debentures outstanding payable to such convertible debenture holders amounted to $3,470,211. If those debentures were converted in full, the shares that would be issued would far exceed the number of shares of our common stock currently outstanding. When those debentures are converted, the shares that are issued are usually immediately sold by the debenture holders into the public market. These sales, and the anticipation of such sales in the future, exerts a downward pressure on our stock price. When a lender converts the debt into shares of our common stock and resells those shares into the market, the result is often a reduction in the market price of our common stock. Until we are able to replace the convertible debentures with debt or equity financing that does not exert a continuing pressure on the market price of our common stock, the market price will continue to be volatile, and investors in our stock will bear a significant risk of reductions in the market value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Market, which may increase the volatility of our stock and make it harder to sell shares of our stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Market, which is the lower tier of the markets maintained by OTC Markets. There is a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Pink (as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system), as a result of which stockholders may experience wide fluctuations and a depressed price in the market price of our securities. Thus, stockholders may be required to either sell our securities at a market price which is lower than their purchase price or to hold our securities for a longer period of time than they planned. Because our common stock falls under the definition of \u201cpenny stock,\u201d trading in our common stock may be limited because broker-dealers are required to provide their customers with disclosure documents prior to allowing them to participate in transactions involving our common stock. These rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors; and require the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market. As a result, the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock may be limited, and stockholders could find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nThere is limited trading of our common stock, and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock have limited trading, and the price if traded may not reflect the value of our Company. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for shares of our common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock or because we are involved in the legal cannabis industry, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interest because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 9,000,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 8,978,999,990 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share and 21,000,010 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share.\nWe may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are trading.", "PERMNO": 70798, "SIC": 5200, "TIC": "PVSP"}
