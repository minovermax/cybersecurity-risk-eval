{"cik": "316253", "company": "ENZO BIOCHEM INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBusiness Risks\nOur operating results may vary from period to period.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including:\n\u00b7 competition from larger commercial clinical laboratories, hospital affiliated laboratories, and physician office laboratories;\n\u00b7 health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors, including those stemming from the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) or its repeal, amendment or replacement;\n\u00b7 changes in reimbursement policies by third party and government payers, especially those stemming from The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d);\n\u00b7 customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;\n\u00b7 the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;\n\u00b7 general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research;\n\u00b7 seasonal fluctuations in revenues due to the impact of weather and holiday periods\n\u00b7 expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties; and\n\u00b7 the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;\nConsequently, results for any interim or full year period may not necessarily be indicative of results in subsequent periods.\nA significant proportion of our Products revenues are from academic centers, funded by government grants in our major markets globally.\nGovernments around the world have been reviewing long term public funding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the available funds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reduced grants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers.\nA significant proportion of our Products revenues are from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech companies.\nGlobally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets, and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers.\nOur future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changing technological environment.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercial acceptance of those products.\nThe development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition, the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearance or approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized.\nWe may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisition targets.\nOur strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified, future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth.\nOur inability to carry out certain of our marketing and sales plans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business.\nThe Life Sciences product segment continues a marketing program designed to more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquired brands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-going enhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers and in leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significant markets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer.\nWe face significant competition, which could cause us to decrease the prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit our growth.\nOur competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United States and abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineering firms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing products which compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The markets for our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products.\nThe clinical laboratory services business is highly fragmented and intensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services, our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals.\nThese competitive conditions could, among other things:\n\u2022 require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;\n\u2022 require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;\n\u2022 increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;\n\u2022 render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;\n\u2022 reduce our revenue\nEthical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products.\nGenetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliers for materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products.\nWe manufacture and distribute our own brand products and the products of third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extent we are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our operations could be disrupted.\nOutside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers provide key finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternative sources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw material would harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming.\nOur manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and development processes involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws, permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposure of hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outside the coverage of, our insurance.\nWe may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplace safety and health laws and regulations.\nWe are required to expend significant resources for research and development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully develop these products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures.\nThe products we are developing are at various stages of development and clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial application is practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cash requirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitive and technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activities and pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed.\nWe do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additional financing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we spend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully.\nIf our product candidates on which we have expended significant amounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures, which may harm our business.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or other harm to our business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and \u201ccloud-based\u201d systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company\u2019s business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyber-attacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company\u2019s digital businesses expand. While the Company has developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company\u2019s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business.\nRisks relating to our Intellectual Property and Regulatory Approval\nProtecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties.\nOur potential revenue and success depends in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. In the absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology.\nPatent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercialization of products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such as the matters discussed under \u201cPart I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consuming and we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute.\nWe have filed applications for United States and foreign patents covering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protection which any issued patent might afford.\nLawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnology industry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion of our management\u2019s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement, other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patent litigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition, an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry, and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court.\nWe also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietary technology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology.\nOur business is subject to governmental laws and regulations. Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumables we use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our tests to market or performing such tests for our customers. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures.\nOur research, preclinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. The tests we develop internally are offered as lab developed tests or LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. As the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing, its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms. In late 2018, legislation was introduced in Congress that would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease. If this legislation were to become law, the FDA could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests. If such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways and creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance attempts to clarify whether FDA approval of certain software is required. In January 2019 the FDA issued draft guidance on a pre-certification pilot program to help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software.\nWe cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022 significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;\n\u2022 loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;\n\u2022 failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;\n\u2022 changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors.\nAdverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene medicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business.\nEthical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaborators may use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay future clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products.\nFinancial Risks\nWith the exception of fiscal years 2019 and 2016, we have experienced significant losses in our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations. If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nAlthough for fiscal year 2019, we reported net income of $2.2 million, we incurred net losses of $10.3 million and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. If our revenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial losses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company.\nWe may need additional capital to fund growth, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed.\nOur ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquidity will depend in part on our ability to grow our products business with higher margin products and increase our market share and continue to grow the Laboratory Services business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume which may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments, changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distribution or research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additional financing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution to their relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our ability to execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had $4.4 million in borrowings under a ten year mortgage agreement with Citibank, N.A., which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Additionally, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard at the start of fiscal 2020 will result in the recognition of right of use assets and liabilities of approximately $25 million. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. The mortgage agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, as defined. Events of default include non-payment of principal and interest on debt outstanding, non-performance of covenants, material changes in business, breach of representations, bankruptcy or insolvency, and changes in control. Our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial performance, which is influenced by a number of factors. Violation of any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the mortgage agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not cured or waived, the lender would have the ability to accelerate the repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the mortgage agreement.\nWe may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibles which would reduce our earnings.\nWe are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment when, and if, an indicator of potential impairment is identified.\nAs of July 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately 8% and 9%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial results for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite lives.\nRisks relating to our Clinical Laboratory Services segment\nThe clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe clinical testing business is a fragmented and highly competitive industry. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices. Hospitals generally\nmaintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital\u2019s laboratory. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital\u2019s laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals. Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position. The diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nOur clinical laboratory services business is subject to extensive government regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part of our business, which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation.\nThe clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, \u201cCLIA\u201d) virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws. The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation.\nReimbursements from third-party payers including managed care organizations and Medicare, upon which our clinical laboratory business is dependent, are subject to varying rates and coverage and legislative reform that are beyond our control. Any reforms that decrease coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business.\nOur clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of those reimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continue to seek, to reduce and limit utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including the areas of clinical and genetic testing. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of payments made to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus our earnings.\nThe health care industry continues to undergo significant change as third-party payers\u2019 increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In an effort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal and state levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals include managed competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrative burdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses.\nSince each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it will reimburse for our tests will likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursement approval or contractual reimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, and have not obtained coverage from Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursement from Medicare is an important factor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercial payers may be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. In cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection.\nWe expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasing adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may take several years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However, we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establish and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.\nGovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significant change and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue. Pursuant to The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), which was implemented in 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgated revised reimbursement rate schedules for the years 2018 through 2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under Medicare. Reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory testing were reduced in 2018 and 2019 and are scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10% in 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement rate reduction from 2021-23 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.\nPrivate health plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. Examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services. Since the passage of ACA, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services. The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing. The increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer.\nChanges in provider mix, including continued growth in capitated managed-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability.\nCertain third party provider companies have adopted national and regional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programs or if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s net revenues and profitability.\nThe number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reduced payments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements under which payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performed without prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participating provider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patient visits to our customer physician locations and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory services business, we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business.\nIntense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasing administrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers make it necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existing customers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow.\nCompliance with Medicare administrative policies, including those pertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive.\nContainment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinical laboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly for the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursement to clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significant portion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nThe development of new, more cost-effective tests that can be performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nAdvances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be \u201cwaived\u201d tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-based testing services and negatively impact our revenues.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratory licensing laws to which we are subject.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The CLIA amendments are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties.\nWe cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws; and (c) the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.\nFDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specific reagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of tests we develop internally are offered as lab developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has published a \u201cDiscussion Document\u201d that provides the FDA\u2019s views on legislation to govern LDTs. New legislation could significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing\nbusiness, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs, hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nAs a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. For example, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example:\n\u00a7 federal anti-kickback laws, which constrain our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including third-party laboratories, by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00a7 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;\n\u00a7 HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and also established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, and which imposed certain requirements relating to privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00a7 the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician\u2019s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and which also prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral;\n\u00a7 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00a7 federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and\n\u00a7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects.\nWe are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our sales techniques or product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third parties of, any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are required to operate our business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denial or withdrawal of product clearances, or private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual\nwhistleblowers in the name of the government, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existing customer relationships do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOther risks relating to our business\nIf we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems our businesses could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout our Company to control our manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the clinical laboratory services processes for: processing specimens, managing inventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries, contributing to our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amounts due vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\nThe integrity and protection of our own data, and that of its customers and employees, is critical to the Company\u2019s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to market its products and services to customers. Although the Company\u2019s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company\u2019s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management, our business could be adversely affected.\nMost of our products and services are highly technical in nature. In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietary technological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our clinical laboratory services.\nIn addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safety and compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnel highly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals.\nWe face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfully recruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals would seriously damage our business.\nWe depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believe that our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significant number of our senior management in a short period of time.\nThe insurance we purchase to cover our potential business risk may be inadequate.\nAlthough we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficient to cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policy limits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so at acceptable costs.\nRisks relating to our international operations\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business.\nSince we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sources products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nFurthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results.\nWe are subject to economic, political and other risks associated with our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries located in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 11% of total revenues in fiscal 2019. Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including\n\u2022 future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;\n\u2022 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022 multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;\n\u2022 restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;\n\u2022 changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, including the potential impact Brexit will have on our UK operations;\n\u2022 changes in shipping costs; and\n\u2022 difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increases in costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business.\nWith our commercialization activities outside of the United States, we are subject to the risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors.\nIn the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operations and seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with various third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programs to maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individuals where compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties and could materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country\u2019s laws may increase the likelihood that we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country\u2019s laws. If our business practices outside the United States are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nOur common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and there has been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;\n\u2022 the gain or loss of significant contracts;\n\u2022 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;\n\u2022 loss of key personnel;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 delays in the development and introduction of new products;\n\u2022 legislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022 general trends in the industries we operate;\n\u2022 recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;\n\u2022 biological or medical discoveries;\n\u2022 disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;\n\u2022 public concern as to the safety of new technologies;\n\u2022 sales of common stock of existing holders;\n\u2022 securities class action or other litigation;\n\u2022 developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;\n\u2022 general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies in our industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value.\nWe currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price.\nWe are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting shares) for five years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation\u2019s board of directors approved the transaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and information technology access could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected timely. Even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nThe existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 33209, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "ENZ"}
