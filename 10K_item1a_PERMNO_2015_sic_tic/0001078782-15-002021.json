{"cik": "17485", "company": "LIBERATOR MEDICAL HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as discussed in the forward-looking statements Section of this Form 10-K Report. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes of this Form 10-K Report.\nCurrent and potential shareholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues, profitability or cash flows in the future. These factors include:\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively affect our share price, future business and financial results.\nCompletion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that certain closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Merger is not completed, our share price and ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7\nhaving to pay certain significant transaction costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger; and\n\u00b7\npotentially having to pay a termination fee of up to $7.2 million or, in certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, reimbursement of up to $2.0 million of Bard\u2019s expenses.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, service providers, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause service providers, customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management\u2019s attention away from ongoing business could affect our financial results or the financial results of the combined company.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions while the Merger is pending without first obtaining Bard\u2019s prior written consent. These restrictions may limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nShareholder litigation against us could result in an injunction or other relief preventing completion of the Merger, the payment of damages in the event the Merger is completed and/or may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations following the Merger.\nTransactions such as the Merger are often subject to lawsuits by stockholders. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no law or order has been enacted or issued by any government entity or any legal proceeding or enforcement action brought by a governmental body that has the effect of prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. Consequently, if the plaintiffs in any lawsuit challenging the Merger are successful in obtaining an injunction or any other relief that prevents us or Bard from consummating the Merger on the agreed upon terms, the Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. Furthermore, if the Merger is prevented or delayed, the lawsuits could result in substantial costs, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors. Item 3 below describes certain putative class action complaints which have been filed challenging the Merger. See also Footnote 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Part IV, Item 15, of this Report. The Company intends to vigorously defend such lawsuits.\nIf the Merger is not completed or we are not otherwise acquired, we will consider other strategic alternatives which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our board of directors will review the various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company, seeking additional financing from existing or new sources, or attempting to implement a sale to either a financial or strategic buyer. These alternative transactions may involve various additional risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team and associated expenses, our ability to consummate any such alternative transaction, our ability or a potential buyer's ability to access capital on acceptable terms or at all and other variables which may adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nSales of a significant portion of our products depend on our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products from government and private insurance plans.\nAny reduction in insurance reimbursement currently available for our products would reduce our revenues. Without a corresponding reduction in the cost of such products, the result would be a reduction in our overall gross profit. Similarly, any increase in the cost of such products would reduce our overall gross profit unless there was a corresponding increase in insurance reimbursement. Our profits could also be affected by the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements for insurance reimbursement. The regulations that govern Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are complex and our compliance with these regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). These agencies and various state agencies conduct audits of most companies and may conduct investigations of some companies billing Medicare and Medicaid. Negative findings or results of audits are subject to appeals and judicial review and are often overturned at various levels.\nThe Company is routinely audited by Medicare and other insurance companies.\nThere is always the possibility that the Company could be the subject of an accelerated audit or investigation as it performs a substantial amount of Medicare billing each year. Medicare audits or investigations could possibly lead to recoupment of monies paid to the Company, fines, off-sets on future payments and even loss of Medicare billing privileges. Since its inception, the Company has had no fines or penalties imposed, but the Company has been audited by all four regional Medicare carriers and from time-to-time been asked to repay amounts on claims previously paid for various reasons such as billing errors, lack of medical records in physician offices, insufficient patient diagnoses, patients receiving home health care, patients having similar equipment, patients not seen by physician recently enough, and lack of adequate medical necessity, all of which are common issues encountered by Medicare providers. Although the Company has set aside reserves for contractual adjustments, demands for repayment could exceed Company reserves and the Company could be unable to pay them, which would adversely affect the Company.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues is generated from the sale of urological supplies.\nAs a result, changes in the external environment, including regulatory changes, that impact the market for sales of urological supplies could be detrimental, depending on market conditions.\nThe Company is subject to uncertainties relating to its growth and plans for further expansion.\nThe Company believes that it is able to control its level of expansion as well as the costs associated with its growth plans. However, (i) some expansions can create significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial personnel and other resources; (ii) a large expansion into existing or new markets could strain these resources and increase our need for capital; and (iii) our personnel, systems, procedures, controls and existing space may not be adequate to support a substantial expansion.\nWe generally incur negative cash flow with respect to the first order from a new customer for chronic care products, due primarily to the marketing and regulatory compliance costs associated with initial customer qualification.\nAccordingly, the profitability of these product lines depends, in large part, on recurring and sustained reorders. Reorder rates are inherently uncertain due to several factors, many of which are outside our control, including changing customer preferences, competitive price pressures, customer transition to extended care facilities, customer mortality, and general economic conditions.\nWe could be liable for harm caused by products that we sell.\nThe sale of medical products entails the risk that users will make product liability claims. A product liability claim could be expensive. While management believes that our insurance provides adequate coverage, no assurance can be made that adequate coverage will exist for these claims.\nWe are subject to litigation risks in connection with legal proceedings that may arise in the course of our business.\nFrom time-to-time, we are party to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course and are incidental to our business. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in litigation or regulatory proceedings against us. Except as set forth above and below, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. As more particularly described in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d we are a defendant in a civil qui tam suit. Although the Company has reached an agreement in principle to fully settle and resolve all claims asserted in the qui tam litigation, no settlement agreement has been executed, and thus we remain subject to legal fees and other costs of defending that litigation, as well as the possibility of an adverse judgment.\nOur growth is dependent upon a robust marketplace with affordable television and Internet advertising opportunities.\nThe effects of competitors entering the marketplace may increase the costs of our advertising efforts and have a negative impact on our growth. We could lose customers as a result of more effective and higher volumes of advertising by competitors. We could lose customers and revenues to new or existing competitors who have greater financial or operating resources.\nMany of the products that we sell are regulated by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nIf any of these agencies mandate a suspension of production or sales of our products or mandate a recall, we may lose sales and incur expenses until we are in compliance with the regulations or change to another acceptable supplier.\nOur business is dependent on future results and factors we do not control.\nOur future results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including:\n-\nchanges in reimbursement guidelines and amounts;\n-\nchanges in regulations affecting the healthcare industry;\n-\nchanges in the mix or cost of our products;\n-\nthe timing of customer orders;\n-\nthe timing, cost, and levels of our advertising spend; and\n-\nthe timing of the introduction or acceptance of new products and services offered by us or our competitors.\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses and products which involve a number of risks that might adversely affect our financial and operational resources.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks that might adversely affect our financial and operational resources, including:\n-\ndiversion of the attention of senior management from important business matters;\n-\ndifficulty in retaining key personnel of an acquired business;\n-\nfailure to assimilate operations of an acquired business;\n-\nfailure to retain the customers of an acquired business;\n-\npossible operating losses and expenses of an acquired business;\n-\nexposure to legal claims for activities of an acquired business prior to acquisition; and\n-\nincurrence of debt and related interest expense.\nThe success of the Company will largely be dependent on Mark Libratore, the Company\u2019s founder and our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business.\nLoss of Mr. Libratore\u2019s services, either through retirement, incapacity or death, may have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has $4,000,000 of key man insurance on Mr. Libratore\u2019s life, with the Company as the beneficiary of $3,000,000 and his wife the beneficiary of $1,000,000.\nMr. Libratore has substantial equity ownership in the Company and has substantial control over certain corporate actions.\nAs of December 8, 2015, Mark Libratore, our President and Chief Executive Officer, held 19,785,867 shares of common stock, or 36.7% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Libratore has the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the following actions:\n-\nthe election of directors;\n-\nthe adoption of stock option plans;\n-\nthe amendment of charter documents; and\n-\nthe approval of certain mergers and other significant corporate transactions, including the sale of the Company.\nThe market price of our stock could be volatile.\nOur common stock has been listed on the NYSE MKT since November 20, 2013. Even though we expect our common stock to continue to be quoted on the NYSE MKT, we cannot predict changes in the trading market for our common stock, including changes in liquidity.\n-\nA large percentage of our outstanding shares are held by a relatively small number of investors, including our President and Chief Executive Officer.\n-\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance of future dividends for our stockholders.\nWe will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on the Company's operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that the Company will be able to pay dividends in the future.", "PERMNO": 14289, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "LBMH"}
