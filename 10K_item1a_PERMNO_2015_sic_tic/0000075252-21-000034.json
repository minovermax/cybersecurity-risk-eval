{"cik": "75252", "company": "OWENS & MINOR INC/VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that we currently believe could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risk factors are in addition to those mentioned in other parts of this report and are not all of the risks that we face. We could also be affected by risks that we currently are not aware of or that we currently do not consider material to our business.\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises or future outbreaks of health crises or other adverse public health developments such as the global pandemic associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nAs a global healthcare solutions company, we are impacted by public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The outbreak has significantly increased uncertainty and unpredictability of global economic conditions and the demand for and supply of raw materials and finished goods required for our operations. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted our operations. In these challenging and dynamic circumstances, we continue to work to protect our teammates and the public, maintain business continuity and sustain our operations, including ensuring the safety and protection of the people who work in our production and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. We may restrict the operations of our production and distribution centers if we deem it necessary or if recommended or mandated by governmental authorities which would have an adverse impact on us. There is a risk that revenues will decrease ultimately resulting in less cash flow, we may see longer duration in receivables collection, and the need to expedite payments to important suppliers may grow. COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact our supply chains relative to global demand for our facial protection, nitrile gloves, and protective apparel products. COVID-19 has also affected and may further affect the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us or to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices. Some of these factors could increase the demand for our products, while others could decrease demand or make it more difficult for us to serve customers. For example, the significant reduction in elective surgical procedures, which began mid-March of 2020, resulted in a material negative impact on our revenue for 2020. Any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic or future outbreaks could result in similar reductions in elective surgical procedures or otherwise reduce demand for our products, any of which could have a material negative impact on our revenues and profit for future periods.\nAlthough we have experienced significant growth in sales volumes for certain of our products (such as PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as improved productivity and manufacturing output, there can be no assurance that such growth rates, increased sales volumes or other improvements will be maintained during or following the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also see a decline in such growth rates and sales volumes when the impact of the pandemic subsides and the healthcare system returns to a more normalized state. In particular, demand for such products may also decline as government-sponsored COVID-19 response stimulus, relief and production initiatives, such as those under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, expire. An accelerated shift of demand away from certain of our products and services could also adversely impact our revenues and profit margins.\nFurthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing and the uncertainty of its duration, any future outbreaks, similar pandemics, the timing of recovery, travel restrictions, business closures or business disruptions, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event\nresulting from the spread of the COVID-19 and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future outbreaks or similar pandemics, may have a material effect on our financial or operational results. However, the following adverse risks exist:\n\u2022Actions by the United States government or other foreign government could affect our business. These actions include purchasing products that we make or sell, imposing new product standards or allowing the use of alternative products, instituting regulatory requirements to purchase only locally manufactured products, exercising control over manufacturing or distribution operations, including use of the DPA, taking trade actions including the imposition or removal of tariffs or import / export controls, subsidizing the supply of products, or other actions;\n\u2022Quarantine decisions by public or private entities may influence our ability to operate or our ability to ship or receive products. For example, if shipping companies cease or reduce land or sea freight channels, raw material and finished good deliveries may be slowed or stopped;\n\u2022Our customers may change their payment patterns or lose their ability to pay invoices, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow;\n\u2022Our suppliers may increase pricing or impose new purchasing requirements, such as minimum purchase quantities or pay-in-advance payment terms, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow;\n\u2022Raw materials or finished goods that we require for our operations may not be available, or pricing for such items may increase beyond the willingness of our customers to pay;\n\u2022New competitors may enter our market, including both small and large scale manufacturers;\n\u2022COVID-19 illness among our workers in manufacturing or distribution operations could impact our operations or compel the closure of one or more facilities for an unknown period of time. Labor relations in our facilities related to COVID-19 could also negatively impact our operations;\n\u2022We may invest in additional manufacturing capacity for which demand slows in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow; and\n\u2022Technology infrastructure failures could materially inhibit our operations that currently include a substantial portion of remote work. For example, voice or data line failures resulting from natural, manmade or cyber-attack could impair our ability to operate.\nWe have incurred additional costs to ensure we meet the needs of our customers, including increasing our workforce in order to produce or distribute certain essential products for our customers, providing personal protective equipment to our workforce, incremental shipping and transportation costs, incremental technology costs, and additional cleaning costs throughout our facilities. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic, any future outbreaks or similar pandemics. Further, our management is focused on mitigating COVID-19, which has required and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources across our enterprise and will delay other value added services and strategic initiatives. Additionally, some of our teammates are currently working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements, and any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future outbreaks, could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, any future outbreaks or similar pandemics, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for the United States or our international markets, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nWe face competition and accelerating pricing pressure.\nThe medical/surgical supply distribution industry in the United States is highly competitive and characterized by pricing and margin pressure for our business. We compete with other national distributors and a number of regional and local distributors, as well as customer self-distribution models and, to a lesser extent, certain outsourced logistics companies. Competitive factors within the medical/surgical supply distribution industry include market pricing, total delivered product cost, product availability, the ability to fill and invoice orders accurately, delivery time, range of services provided, efficient product sourcing, inventory management, information technology, electronic commerce capabilities, and the ability to meet customer-specific requirements. Our success is dependent on the ability to compete on the above factors, while managing internal costs and expenses.\nThese competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation in response to cost containment legislation and general market pressures to reduce costs. This consolidation of our\ncustomers and suppliers generally gives them greater bargaining power to reduce the pricing available to them, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have concentration in and dependence on certain healthcare provider customers and Group Purchasing Organizations.\nIn 2020, although no single customer accounted for 5% of our consolidated net revenue, our top ten customers in the United States represented approximately 21% of our consolidated net revenue. In addition, in 2020, approximately 72% of our consolidated net revenue was from sales to member hospitals under contract with our largest group purchasing organizations (GPO): Vizient, Premier and HPG. We could lose a significant healthcare provider customer or GPO relationship if an existing contract expires without being replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to its expiration. Although the termination of our relationship with a given GPO would not necessarily result in the loss of the member hospitals as customers, any such termination of a GPO relationship, or a significant individual healthcare provider customer relationship, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating income is dependent on certain significant domestic suppliers.\nIn North America, we distribute products from approximately 1,100 suppliers and are dependent on these suppliers for the continuing supply of products. In 2020, sales of products of our ten largest domestic suppliers accounted for approximately 41% of consolidated net revenue. No sales of products of any individual suppliers exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenue for 2020. We rely on suppliers to provide agreeable purchasing and delivery terms and performance incentives. Our ability to sustain adequate operating income has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to obtain favorable terms and incentives from suppliers, as well as suppliers continuing use of third-party distributors to sell and deliver their products. A change in terms by a significant supplier, the decision of such a supplier to distribute its products directly to healthcare providers rather than through third-party distributors, or a key supplier\u2019s failure to sell and deliver us products necessary to meet our customers\u2019 demands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn interruption in the ability of our business to manufacture products may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe manufacture the majority of our products in nine facilities: four in the United States, one each in Thailand, Ireland and Honduras and two in Mexico. If one or more of these facilities experience damage, or if these manufacturing capabilities are otherwise limited or stopped due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including pandemic, natural disasters, geopolitical events, prolonged power or equipment failures, labor disputes or unsuccessful imports/exports of products as well as supply chain transportation disruptions, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at required levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of these manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to obtain key components, raw materials or manufactured products from third parties may have a material adverse effect on our Global Products segment.\nOur Global Products segment depends on the availability of various components, raw materials and manufactured products supplied by others for its operations. If the capabilities of suppliers and third-party manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to quality, regulatory or other reasons, including pandemic, natural disasters, geopolitical events, prolonged power or equipment failures, labor disputes or unsuccessful imports/exports of products as well as supply chain transportation disruptions, or other reasons, that could negatively impact our ability to manufacture or deliver our products and could lead to exposure to regulatory actions. Further, for quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we have purchased from sole suppliers certain components and raw materials such as polymers used in our products, and we expect to continue to purchase these components and raw materials from these sole suppliers. Although there are other sources in the market place for these items, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials due to regulations and requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. The loss of any sole supplier or any sustained supply interruption that affects the ability to manufacture or deliver our products in a timely or cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Global Products segment is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur Global Products segment relies on product inputs, such as polypropylene and nitrile, as well as other commodities, in the manufacture of its products. Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. The ability to hedge commodity prices is limited. Furthermore, due to competitive dynamics, we may be unable to pass along commodity-driven cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or\nsurcharges, we could experience lower margins and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a customer that has a substantial amount owed to us.\nWe provide credit in the normal course of business to customers. We perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintain reserves for credit losses. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of one or more customers with substantial balances due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanging conditions in the United States healthcare industry may impact our results of operations.\nA large percentage of our revenue is derived in the United States. We, along with our customers and suppliers, are subject to extensive federal and state regulations relating to healthcare as well as the policies and practices of the private healthcare insurance industry. In recent years, there have been a number of government and private initiatives to reduce healthcare costs and government spending. These changes have included an increased reliance on managed care; reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; a shift in healthcare provider venues from acute care settings to clinics, physician offices and home care; and the development of larger, more sophisticated purchasing groups. All of these changes place additional financial pressure on healthcare provider customers, who in turn seek to reduce the costs and pricing of products and services provided by us. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly and these potential changes, which may include a reduction in government support of healthcare services, adverse changes in legislation or regulations, and further reductions in healthcare reimbursement practices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis we had approximately $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness as well as approximately $211 million in contractual obligations under our operating leasing arrangements and $283 million of undrawn availability under our credit facilities. Our ratio of total debt to total shareholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2020 was 144%.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend upon our financial condition or the condition of the capital markets at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to refinance, extend or repay our substantial indebtedness which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition.\nOur 2024 Notes become due and payable in December 2024. We may need to raise capital in order to repay the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 2020, we owed $246 million in principal under our 2024 Notes. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital to repay this obligation at maturity and we are otherwise unable to extend the maturity dates or refinance this obligation, we would be in default. Additionally, our Credit Agreement has a \u201cspringing maturity date\u201d with respect to the Term B Loan. If as of the date 91 days prior to the maturity date of our 2024 Notes, all outstanding amounts under the 2024 Notes have not been paid in full, the Termination Date of the Term B Loan shall be the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 2024 Notes. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise the necessary amount of capital to repay this obligation or that we will be able to extend the maturity dates or otherwise refinance this obligation. Upon a default, our lenders would have\nthe right to exercise its rights and remedies to collect, which would include foreclosing on our assets. Accordingly, a default would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain borrowings under our Credit Agreement and Receivables Securitization Program bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease.\nOur credit facilities and our existing notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our financial flexibility.\nOur Credit Agreement, including our Term Loans and Revolver, Receivables Securitization Program, as well as the indentures that govern our existing senior notes, contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nOur credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes include restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur indebtedness; grant liens; engage in acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and liquidations; use of proceeds from asset dispositions for general corporate purposes, restricted payments, or investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; make capital expenditures; and amend, modify or prepay certain indebtedness. Under our credit facilities, we are subject to financial covenants that require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage, including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions or covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. If a default under the credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes is not cured or waived, such default could result in the acceleration of debt or other payment obligations under our debt or other agreements that contain cross-acceleration, cross-default or similar provisions, which could require us to repurchase or pay debt or other obligations prior to the date it is otherwise due.\nOur ability to comply with covenants contained in the credit facilities, including the Credit Agreement and Receivables Securitization Program, and the indentures governing our existing senior notes and any other debt or other agreements to which we are or may become a party, may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us.\nWe may incur product liability losses, litigation liability, product recalls, safety alerts or regulatory action associated with the products that we source, assemble, manufacture and sell which can be costly and disruptive to our business.\nThe risk of product liability claims is inherent in the design, assembly, manufacture and marketing of the medical products of the types we sell. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to the products that we source, assemble, manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the relevant surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or information.\nIn addition to product liability claims and litigation, an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient associated with our products could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, or suspension or delay of regulatory product approvals or clearances, product seizures or detentions, governmental investigations, civil or criminal sanctions or injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of our products. Any one of these could result in significant costs and negative publicity resulting in reduced market acceptance and demand for our products and harm our reputation. In addition, a recall or injunction affecting our products could temporarily shut down production lines or place products on a shipping hold.\nAll of the foregoing types of legal proceedings and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the outcome, could disrupt our business, result in substantial costs or the diversion of management attention and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe must obtain clearance or approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to introducing a new product or a modification to an existing product. The regulatory clearance process may result in substantial costs, delays and limitations on the types and uses of products we can bring to market, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the United States, before we can market a new product, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance or approval from the FDA and certain other regulatory authorities. Most major markets for medical products outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical product can be costly and time consuming, involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, require changes in products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. We cannot assure you that these clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, once a medical product has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before it may be modified, its labeling changed or marketed for a different use. Medical products are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and promoting a device for an off-label use could result in government enforcement action. Furthermore, a product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the medical product or issues relating to its application. The regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed, if at all, realization of product net sales, substantial additional costs and limitations on the types of products we may bring to market or their indicated uses, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately establish, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights or prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of such rights.\nOur intellectual property is an important part of our business. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products and services, potentially resulting in the loss of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets (including know-how) and domain names, in addition to employee and third-party confidentiality agreements, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish, maintain, protect and enforce our rights in our technology, proprietary information and processes. For example, we rely on trademark protection to protect our rights to various marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our products and services. Furthermore, intellectual property laws and our procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete.\nOther parties may also independently develop technologies, products and services that are substantially similar or superior to ours. We also may be forced to bring claims against third parties. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective, and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering technologies, products or services that are substantially similar or superior to ours and that compete with our business. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement, misappropriation or other violation.\nWe may become subject to litigation brought by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement, misappropriation or other violations of the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. However, we may become party to disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property held by third parties. For example, third parties may allege that we have infringed upon or not obtained sufficient rights in the technologies used in our products and services. We cannot assure that we are not infringing or violating, and have not infringed or violated, any third-party intellectual property rights, or that we will not be held to have done so or be accused of doing so in the future. Any claim that we have violated intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not it results in litigation, is settled out of court or is determined in our favor, could be time consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and attention of management and technical personnel from our business. Our liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business and operations depend on the proper functioning of critical facilities, supply chain and distribution networks.\nDamage or disruption to our supply chain and distribution capabilities due to pandemic, weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, strikes, the financial and/or operational instability of key suppliers, geo-political events or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute products and conduct our business. To the extent that we are unable, or it is not financially feasible, to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, COVID-19 has caused supply\nchain disruptions for certain manufacturers of medical products and an increased demand for these products resulting in the implementation of product allocations by certain manufacturers.\nOur operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, and our business could be adversely affected if we experience a cyber-attack or other systems breach.\nWe rely on information systems to receive, process, analyze and manage data in distributing thousands of inventory products to customers from numerous distribution and outsourced logistics centers. These systems are also relied upon for billings to and collections from customers, as well as the purchase of and payment for inventory and related transactions from our suppliers. In addition, the success of our long-term growth strategy is dependent upon the ability to continually monitor and upgrade our information systems to provide better service to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events (including cyber-attacks) or fail to operate for an extended period of time, or if we fail to appropriately enhance our systems to support growth and strategic initiatives.\nWe are subject to stringent regulatory and licensing requirements.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels in the United States and other countries where we operate. We also are required to hold permits and licenses and to comply with the operational and security standards of various governmental bodies and agencies. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any failure to maintain the necessary permits, licenses or approvals, or to comply with the required standards, could disrupt our operations and/or adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAmong the U.S. healthcare related laws that we are subject to include the U.S. federal Anti-kickback Statute, the U.S. federal Stark Law, the False Claims Act and similar state laws relating to fraud, waste and abuse. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and it is possible that regulatory authorities could challenge our policies and practices. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments), which could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur global operations are also subject to risks of violation of laws, including those that prohibit improper payments to and bribery of government officials and other individuals and organizations. These laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, any violation of which could result in substantial liability and a loss of reputation in the marketplace. Failure to comply with these laws also could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur Byram business is a Medicare-certified supplier and participates in state Medicaid programs. Failure to comply with applicable standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nWe collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information, which are subject to federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. Regulations currently in place continue to evolve, and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect, handle and maintain personal or patient information, or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Violations of federal (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA), state or foreign laws (such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, as amended, or GDPR) concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, breach of contract claims, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nCompliance with the terms and conditions of Byram\u2019s Corporate Integrity Agreement requires significant resources and, if we fail to comply, we could be subject to penalties or excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nPrior to its acquisition by Owens & Minor, Byram entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement beginning April 2016 with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cOIG\u201d). The Corporate Integrity Agreement provides that Byram shall, among other things, establish and maintain a compliance program, including a corporate compliance officer and committee, a code of conduct, comprehensive compliance policies and procedures, training and monitoring, a review process for certain arrangements between Byram and referral sources, a compliance hotline, an open door policy and a disciplinary process for compliance violations. The Corporate Integrity\nAgreement further provides that Byram shall provide periodic reports to the OIG, complete certain regular certifications and engage an Independent Review Organization to perform reviews of certain arrangements between Byram and referral sources.\nFailing to meet the Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for Byram including monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. In addition, in the event of an uncured material breach or deliberate violation of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions.\nWe operate throughout the United States and other countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed, including but not limited to proposals to repeal LIFO (last-in, first-out) treatment of inventory in the United States or changes in tax accounting methods for inventory, import tariffs and taxes, or other tax items. In addition, a new presidential administration and a new Congress recently took office in the United States. It is not yet known what changes Congress, working with the President, will make to existing tax laws and how those changes (if any) will affect the economy, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These and other changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our tax positions, tax rate or cash payments for taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.\nOur global operations increase the extent of our exposure to the economic, political, currency, regulatory and other risks of international operations.\nOur global operations involve issues and risks, including but not limited to the following, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations:\n\u2022Lack of familiarity with and expertise in conducting business in foreign markets;\n\u2022Foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risk;\n\u2022Unexpected changes in foreign regulations or conditions relating to labor, the economic or political environment, and social norms or requirements;\n\u2022Adverse tax consequences and difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad;\n\u2022Local economic environments, recession, inflation, indebtedness, currency volatility and competition; and\n\u2022Changes in trade protection laws and other laws affecting trade and investment, including import/export regulations in both the United States and foreign countries.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nPoor or deteriorating economic conditions in the United States and the other countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for healthcare services and consequently, the demand for our products and services. Poor economic conditions also could lead our suppliers to offer less favorable terms of purchase to distributors, which would negatively affect our profitability. These and other possible consequences of financial and economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of our reputation.\nOne of the reasons why customers choose to do business with us and why teammates choose us as a place of employment is the reputation that we have built over many years. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish our brand and lead to adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.\nTraditional distribution relationships are being challenged by online commerce solutions. Such competition will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technology, to continue to provide enhanced service offerings and to continue to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address demands of consumers and customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAudits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods, and tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, they can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nU.S. GAAP requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. No impairment charges to goodwill were recorded in 2020 or 2019. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which charge could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022changes in our industry and competitors;\n\u2022changes in government or legislation;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;\n\u2022activism by any single large shareholder or combination of shareholders;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022general market and economic conditions;\n\u2022any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business;\n\u2022impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future outbreaks and any future pandemics; and\n\u2022the other factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nIn addition, the NYSE can experience price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on NYSE. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to adequately integrate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn connection with our growth strategy, we from time to time acquire other businesses, that we believe will expand or complement our existing businesses and operations. The integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, which may include but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Expenses and difficulties in the transition and integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022Retention of current customers and the ability to obtain new customers;\n\u2022The assimilation and retention of personnel, including management personnel, in the acquired businesses;\n\u2022Accounting, tax, regulatory and compliance issues that could arise;\n\u2022Difficulties in implementing uniform controls, procedures and policies in our acquired companies;\n\u2022Unanticipated expenses incurred or charges to earnings based on unknown circumstances or liabilities;\n\u2022Failure to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition or at the pace we anticipate;\n\u2022General economic conditions in the markets in which the acquired businesses operate;\n\u2022Difficulties encountered in conducting business in markets where we have limited experience and expertise;\n\u2022Failure to fully integrate information technology;\n\u2022Inadequate indemnification from the seller; and\n\u2022Failure of the seller to perform under any transition services agreement.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete and integrate our strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business, growth strategies and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain talented and qualified teammates is critical to our success and competitiveness.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced teammates, including key executives. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract, or retain qualified and experienced teammates. Competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain teammates. We may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes, including illness, and must adequately plan for succession of key executive roles. Teammates might not successfully transition into new roles. Any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 60186, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "OMI"}
