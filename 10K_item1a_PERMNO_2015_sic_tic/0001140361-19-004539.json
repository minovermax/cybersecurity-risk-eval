{"cik": "1228627", "company": "REXAHN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information included in this Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of these risks. If any of these risks occur, the value of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe currently have no product revenues, have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and will need to raise additional capital to operate our business.\nTo date, we have generated no product revenues and have incurred negative cash flow from operations. Until we receive approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our drugs and will not have product revenues. We expect to continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from the net proceeds of equity or debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing fees and grants, if any. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we will have to reduce our research and development activities, and it may be more difficult to pursue our strategy to develop our pipeline. We will first reduce research and development activities associated with any preclinical compounds. To the extent necessary, we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical stage product candidates.\nUnforeseen events, difficulties, complications and delays may occur that could cause us to utilize our existing capital at a faster rate than projected, including the progress of our research and development efforts, the cost and timing of regulatory approvals and the costs of protecting our intellectual property rights. We may seek additional financing to implement and fund other product candidate development, clinical trial and research and development efforts, including clinical trials for other new product candidates, as well as other research and development projects.\nWe will need additional financing to continue to develop our product candidates, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to complete our planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we may be forced to reduce or discontinue product development or product licensing, reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities in order to improve our liquidity to enable us to continue operations. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the sale of our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $154,687,242 and $140,318,712, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net losses of $14,368,530 and $25,294,503, respectively. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future, including related to:\n\u00b7\ncontinued preclinical development and clinical trials for our current and new product candidates;\n\u00b7\nfinding and maintaining suitable partnerships to help us research, develop and commercialize product candidates;\n\u00b7\nefforts to seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nimplementing additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nin-licensing additional technologies to develop; and\n\u00b7\nhiring additional personnel or entering into relationships with third parties to perform functions that we are unable to perform on our own.\nWe also expect to continue to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. Until we have the capacity to generate revenues, we are relying upon outside funding resources to fund our cash flow requirements. If these resources are depleted or unavailable, it may be more difficult to pursue our strategy to develop our pipeline, we may be unable to continue to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern will require us to raise additional capital to fund our current operations, which may be unavailable on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business and have an accumulated deficit. As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2018, we concluded at the time of filing that report that substantial doubt existed about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the financial statements contained in that report. We currently believe, based on our projected operating expenses, that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the proceeds received from our underwritten public offering in January 2019, will be sufficient to fund current operations for at least the next 12 months following the issuance of the financial statements contained in this Annual report. Our ability to continue as a going concern in the near term is largely dependent on our actual expenses, business decisions and our ability to obtain additional capital, and over time will be impacted by our ability to attain operating efficiencies, control expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. However, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern\nWe have a limited operating history, we have no products approved for sale and we have not demonstrated an ability to commercialize product candidates.\nWe are a clinical-stage company with a limited number of product candidates. We currently do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval, and we have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates. The successful commercialization of our product candidates will require us to first perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nformulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7\nconducting sales and marketing activities.\nTo date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology, and undertaking product candidate research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our principal product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for assessing our ability to commercialize product candidates.\nWe will be unable to issue additional shares for future capital raising transactions or strategic transactions unless we obtain stockholder approval to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock available for issuance.\nWe have 75,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. As of February 11, 2019, we had 48,277,420 shares of common stock outstanding, 26,435,515 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, settlement of restricted stock units or exercise of outstanding warrants, and 283,729 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock option plans. As a result, as of February 11, 2019, we had approximately 3,336 shares of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance. We will be limited by the number of additional shares available for future capital raising transactions or strategic transactions unless we obtain stockholder approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to implement a reverse stock split without a corresponding reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock or to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. We have solicited the approval of our stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation for a reverse stock split, but we cannot be certain that our stockholders will approve the amendment. A delay in securing, or a failure to secure, stockholder approval to amend our certificate of incorporation could cause a delay in our future capital raising, collaboration, partnership or other strategic transactions, and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of NYSE American, our common stock could be delisted. If it is delisted, our common stock and the liquidity of our common stock would be impacted.\nOur common stock is listed on NYSE American, and the continued listing of our common stock on NYSE American is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. For example, Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide provides that a company\u2019s common stock may be delisted from NYSE American if it sells for a substantial period of time at a low price per share and the company fails to effect a reverse stock split or otherwise demonstrate sustained price improvement within a reasonable time after being notified that NYSE American deems such action to be appropriate under all the circumstances. There is no assurance that the market price of our common stock will remain at the level required to remain in compliance with NYSE American listing standards or that we will otherwise remain in compliance with NYSE American listing standards.\nDelisting from NYSE American would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. Moreover, we committed in connection with the sale of securities to use commercially reasonably efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock during such time that certain warrants are outstanding.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nSeveral of our product candidates are in clinical trials, which are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nOur product candidates are in various stages of development and require extensive clinical testing. Such testing is expensive and time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge and expertise.\nHuman clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming, and the outcome is not certain. We estimate that clinical trials of our current product candidates will take multiple years to complete. Failure can occur at any stage of a clinical trial, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or precluded by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority on the design of a given trial, or in obtaining authorization to commence a trial;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining approval of an IRB to conduct a clinical trial at a given site;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials, including as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling study subjects;\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in having subjects complete a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow up;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites or investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites;\n\u00b7\nfailure of third-party CROs to meet their contractual obligations or deadlines;\n\u00b7\nthe need to modify a study protocol;\n\u00b7\nnegative or inconclusive results during clinical trials, including the emergence of dosing issues, unforeseen safety issues or lack of effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the standard of care of the indication being studied;\n\u00b7\nreliance on third-party suppliers for the clinical trial supply of product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u00b7\nlack of sufficient funding to finance the clinical trials; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative action.\nWe, the FDA or an IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including if it appears that the clinical trial is exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our IND applications or the conduct of the trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or the termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates or result in early termination of development of our product candidates.\nPreclinical studies and preliminary and interim data from clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results or success of ongoing or later clinical trials of our product candidates. If we cannot replicate the results from our preclinical studies and initial clinical trials of our product candidates in later clinical trials, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates for any particular use, if at all.\nPreclinical studies and any positive preliminary and interim data from our clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results of ongoing or later clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including us and many other companies with greater resources and experience than we, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in prior clinical trials. Even if we are able to complete our planned clinical trials of our product candidates according to our current development timeline, initial positive results from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trial results. The design of our later stage clinical trials could differ in significant ways (e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria, endpoints, statistical analysis plan) from our earlier stage clinical trials, which could cause the outcomes of the later stage trials to differ from those of our earlier stage clinical trials. If we fail to produce positive results in our planned clinical trials of any of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nIf the results of our clinical trials fail to support the approval of any of our product candidates, the completion of development of that candidate may be significantly delayed, or we may be forced to abandon development altogether, which will significantly impair our ability to generate product revenues.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that clinical results will support approval of our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that one or more of our product candidates are safe and effective for indicated uses. As a result, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials or may decide to abandon a product candidate, in which case we may never recognize any revenue related to such candidate. Standard of care treatments may change, which may require additional clinical trials. Repeating clinical trials or conducting additional clinical trials will increase our development costs and delay the filing of an NDA and, ultimately, delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nWe may not obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates, and we cannot guarantee how long it will take the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies to review applications for our product candidates.\nWe will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from the comparable regulatory authorities to commercialize our product candidates in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe time it takes to obtain approval, either in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, is unpredictable, but typically takes many years, depending upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Obtaining approval requires substantial resources and is subject to regulatory authorities\u2019 substantial discretion. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary among jurisdictions. We cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will ultimately be approved by the FDA or any other regulatory authority, or the length of time obtaining approval will take. One of our product candidates, RX-0301, is in the drug class known as Akt-1 inhibitors that to date have not been approved by the FDA, and we have not submitted an NDA for any Akt-1 inhibitor.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign authority for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate to the authority\u2019s satisfaction that the product candidate is safe and effective for the proposed indication;\n\u00b7\nfailure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate that the product\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u00b7\ndisagreement with our interpretation of preclinical or clinical data; and\n\u00b7\ninadequacies in the manufacturing facilities or processes of third-party manufacturers.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign authority may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans or cause us to abandon the development program. Further, any approval we receive may be for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not include labeling claims necessary for successful commercialization of the product candidate, or may be contingent upon our conducting costly post-marketing clinical trials. Any of these scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of a product candidate.\nAny of our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit its commercial viability, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. Side effects could affect patient recruitment, the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, and/or result in potential product liability claims. Results of our trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. If we do not receive approval to market any product candidates, we will be unable to generate revenues from those product candidates and this may prevent us from achieving profitability.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may suspend marketing of such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such products;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to develop a REMS for such product or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS, or to develop a similar strategy as required by a comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to conduct post-market studies;\n\u00b7\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nWe are developing RX-3117, and may develop other product candidates, in combination with other therapies, which exposes us to additional regulatory risks.\nWe are developing RX-3117 in combination with ABRAXANE and may develop other product candidates in combination with one or more currently approved cancer therapies. Even if any product candidate we develop were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risk that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product candidate or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies. This could result in our own products being removed from the market or being less successful commercially. Combination therapies are commonly used for the treatment of cancer, and we would be subject to similar risks if we develop any of our product candidates for use in combination with other drugs or for indications other than cancer.\nWe may also evaluate product candidates in combination with one or more other cancer therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market and sell any product candidate we develop in combination with any such unapproved cancer therapies that do not ultimately obtain marketing approval.\nIf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve, or revoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues arise with, the products and product candidates we choose to evaluate in combination with our product candidates, we may be unable to obtain approval of or market our product candidates.\nEven if our product candidates obtain approval, they may face future development and regulatory difficulties that can negatively affect commercial prospects.\nEven if we obtain approval for a product candidate, it would be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and restrictions of the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities regarding manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting. Failure by us or any of the third parties on which we rely to meet those requirements can lead to enforcement action, among other consequences, that could significantly impair our ability to successfully commercialize a given product. If the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information, it can impose additional restrictions on how the product is marketed or may seek to withdraw marketing approval altogether.\nThere is no assurance that any of our product candidates that has received or will receive orphan drug designation will subsequently obtain orphan drug exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will provide the desired benefit.\nAlthough we have obtained orphan drug designation for one use of RX-3117 and in the future may obtain additional orphan drug designation for RX-3117 or any of our other product candidates, we are not assured of being awarded orphan drug exclusivity or realizing the benefits of such exclusivity, even if any of these products is approved for its orphan-designated use. If another company also holding orphan drug designation for a product containing the same active moiety intended for the same rare disease or condition receives approval before our orphan-designated product, approval of our product could be precluded for seven years because of that product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity, unless we could demonstrate our product to be clinically superior to the earlier-approved product. Similarly, even if our orphan designated drug were approved first and awarded seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, it would not block approval of the other product if that product were shown to be clinically superior, or if we fail to assure a sufficient quantity of our orphan drug. Additionally, because orphan drug exclusivity is product- and indication-specific, it does not prevent approval of another drug for the same orphan indication or the same drug for a different use.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe intend to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates in a countries outside of the United States, such as China, and expect that these countries will be important markets for our product candidates, if approved. Marketing our products in these countries will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The regulations that apply to the conduct of clinical trials and approval procedures vary from country to country and may require additional testing. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in other jurisdictions may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a drug must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be diminished and our business prospects could be adversely impacted.\nThe market opportunities for any current or future product candidate we develop, if approved, may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for established therapies or for whom prior therapies have failed, and may be small.\nAny revenue we are able to generate in the future from product sales will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the market in the United States and any other jurisdiction for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets or patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, even if approved.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first-line, second-line, or third-line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third-line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first-line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, radiation therapy or a combination of these, is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Second- and third-line therapies are administered to patients when prior therapy is not effective. We may initially seek approval for other product candidates as therapies for patients who have received one or more prior treatments. If we do so, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval potentially as a first-line therapy, but there is no guarantee that any product candidate we develop, even if approved, would be approved for first-line therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials.\nThe number of patients who have the types of cancer we are targeting may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for our current or future product candidates may be limited, if and when approved. Even if we obtain significant market share for any product candidate, if and when approved, if the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining marketing approval for additional indications, including to be used as first- or second-line therapy.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs, our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be materially impaired.\nEven if the FDA approves our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Future acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nawareness of a drug\u2019s availability and benefits;\n\u00b7\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u00b7\npharmacological benefit and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u00b7\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or other third-party payors;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any; and\n\u00b7\nthe price at which we sell our products.\nBecause we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted and future legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms.\nSome of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and to alter the implementation of the ACA and related laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. In addition, in December 2018, a United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because the tax penalty associated with the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This ruling is under appeal and stayed pending appeal. While the court, the Trump Administration and CMS have stated that the ruling will have no effect while this appeal is pending, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, regulations promulgated under the Affordable Care Act or portions thereof will impact the Affordable Care Act and its implementation. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. Any such changes could decrease the number of individuals with health coverage. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, recent legislative enactments have resulted in Medicare payments being subject to a two percent reduction, referred to as sequestration, until 2027. Continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve a profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing.\nThe implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business. Security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our collaborators, our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs and business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts for our product candidates and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed or our commercial operations could be impacted. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. HIPAA generally requires that healthcare providers and other covered entities obtain written authorizations from patients prior to disclosing protected health information of the patient (unless an exception to the authorization requirement applies). If authorization is required and the patient fails to execute an authorization or the authorization fails to contain all required provisions, then we may not be allowed access to and use of the patient\u2019s information and our research efforts could be impaired or delayed. Furthermore, use of protected health information that is provided to us pursuant to a valid patient authorization is subject to the limits set forth in the authorization (e.g., for use in research and in submissions to regulatory authorities for product approvals). In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, foreign or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nthe federal civil False Claims Act imposes penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA and its implementing regulations also impose obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals (and certain other practitioners beginning in 2022), as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to certain healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. For a fuller discussion of the applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business, see Item 1, \u201cDescription of Business - Government Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations. We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations (\u201cTrade Laws\u201d) prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector.\nOur business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated organizations, including outside of the United States. We have engaged or plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities. Our operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, which prohibits, among other things, U.S. companies and their employees and agents from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to foreign government officials, employees of public international organizations and foreign government-owned or affiliated entities, candidates for foreign political office, and foreign political parties or officials thereof. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws.\nViolations of Trade Laws could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, the closing down of facilities, including those of our suppliers and manufacturers, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could also result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries as well as difficulties in manufacturing or continuing to develop our products, and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies, including smaller companies that are or may be collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as more experience in:\n\u00b7\ndeveloping drugs;\n\u00b7\nundertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u00b7\nformulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u00b7\nlaunching, marketing and selling drugs.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies currently sell both generic and proprietary compounds for the treatment of cancer. In addition, companies developing oncology therapies represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel, parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.\nThere are currently marketed products and product candidates under development by our competitors that have similar mechanisms of action or target some of the same indications as our clinical stage product candidates. If approved, RX-3117 could compete with other compounds with an anti-metabolite mechanism of action in cancers, such as NUC-1031 (Acelarin), which is under development by Cunanan, and other approved nucleoside analogues such as capecitabine and gemcitabine. We are not currently aware of known inhibitors of phosphorylated p68 that would compete with RX-5902 if RX-5902 were approved, but other drugs with a different mechanism of action are approved or in development for the same indications, including AstraZeneca\u2019s LYNPARZA (olaparib), Immunomedics\u2019 sacituzumab govitecan and various PD-1 inhibitors, including Genentech\u2019s TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab), that are in development for TNBC. If approved, RX-0301 could compete with other Akt-1 inhibitors under development by other companies including Merck & Company, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Gilead Sciences, MEI Pharma, PIQUR Therapeutics and others.\nOur competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to, obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates, or developing products that are more effective and/or safer than ours, any of which could render our product candidates less competitive prior to recovery by us of expenses incurred with respect to their development and could lead us to alter our business plans or development strategies. For example, in response to the changing treatment landscape for renal cell carcinoma (\u201cRCC\u201d) patients over the prior two years with the approval of new therapies by the FDA, in February 2018, we announced plans to discontinue the internally funded programs of RX-0201 and ceased enrolling patients in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial of RX-0201 in patients with metastatic RCC.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates, indications and development programs. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. If we are unable to manage our limited resources effectively, we may not efficiently use these resources, which may delay the development of our product candidates and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining the rights to product candidates to continue building our development pipeline, or these in-licenses may not be successful.\nIn addition to our own internally developed product candidates, we are seeking opportunities to acquire or in-license compounds in oncology and other therapeutic areas that are strategic additions to our current product pipeline, which entails additional risk to us. Identifying, selecting and acquiring promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any product candidates from third parties, including because we are focusing on a specific area of care and we may be unable to identify product candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company. In addition, efforts to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire product candidates that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to in-license or acquire the relevant product candidate on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nIf we are unable to identify programs that ultimately result in approved products, we may spend material amounts of our capital and other resources evaluating, acquiring and developing products that ultimately do not provide a return on our investment. Such additional product candidates could significantly increase our capital requirements and place further strain on our limited resources, including on the time of our existing personnel, which may delay or otherwise adversely affect the development of our existing product candidates.\nWe are dependent on our executives and other key professionals and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our executives, including: our President and Chief Executive Officer, Douglas J. Swirsky; our Chief Business Officer, Lisa Nolan; and other key personnel. The loss of any of these individuals, or our inability to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner, could materially and adversely affect our business and our prospects. All our employees, including our chief executive officer, are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d and any of them may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time. For example, we announced in March 2019 that Ely Benaim, M.D. resigned as Chief Medical Officer effective March 31, 2019. We have no present intention of obtaining key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key professionals.\nWe may need to attract, train and retain additional experienced executives and other key professionals in the future.\nIn the future, we may need to attract, train and retain additional executives and other key professionals. There is a high demand for experienced executive, scientific, manufacturing and quality personnel in our industry, and competition for such individuals is intense. For example, our Chief Medical Officer recently announced that he was leaving our company to work for another company. We do not know whether we will be able to attract, train and retain such experienced personnel to support our business activities and research and development activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew or future changes to tax laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (except for certain small businesses), effective for net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain how various states will respond to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with partners. Although we currently carry clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance we, or any collaborators, may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost. Even if our agreements with any future collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claims arise.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nMuch of our drug development program depends upon third parties, and if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have engaged third-party CROs and other investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions and other life science companies, to conduct our preclinical studies, toxicology studies and clinical trials, and to pursue development for our product candidates. For example, in February 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Zhejiang Haichang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (\u201cHaichang\u201d) pursuant to which Haichang will develop RX-0301 and will conduct certain preclinical and clinical activities through completion of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in hepatic cell carcinoma in China. Engaging third parties, or collaborating with third parties, is typical practice in our industry. However, relying on such organizations means that the conduct of clinical trials and other studies, and the completion of these trials and studies, is not within our direct control. Trials and studies may be delayed due to circumstances outside our control, and such delays may result in additional expenses for us.\nWhile we make efforts to oversee the work of third-party contractors, these collaborators are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control the effort, time or other resources that they devote to our programs. Third parties may not assign priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking them ourselves. In addition, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical and nonclinical studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, such as cGCP and good laboratory practice, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or any of our collaborators or CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cGCP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and our ability to generate and grow revenues.\nIf outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA applications and introduction of new drugs to the market may be delayed or unsuccessful. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. For example, the success of the Haichang agreement depends on, among other things, the skills, experience and efforts of Haichang, Haichang\u2019s commitment to the arrangement, and the financial condition of Haichang, all of which are beyond our control. In the event that Haichang fails to successfully develop or commercialize RX-0301, including due to early termination of the Haichang agreement, our ability to obtain license fees, milestone payments and royalties would be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. Our collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost, requires management time and focus and could result in substantial delays in our development programs. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying and managing the performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates, which exposes us to a number of risks that may delay development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates internally. Therefore, we rely on third-party expertise to support us in this area. We have entered into contracts with third-party manufacturers to manufacture, supply, store and distribute supplies of our product candidates for our clinical trials. If any of our product candidates receives FDA approval, we expect to rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs. We have no current plans to build internal manufacturing capacity for any product candidate, and we have no long-term supply arrangements.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to potential risks, such as the following:\n\u00b7\nWe may be unable to contract with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. Potential manufacturers of any product candidate that is approved will be subject to FDA compliance inspections and any new manufacturer would have to be qualified to produce our products;\n\u00b7\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u00b7\nOur third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials through completion or to successfully produce, store and distribute our commercial products, if approved;\n\u00b7\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other government agencies to ensure compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have direct control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards, but we may ultimately be responsible for any of their failures;\n\u00b7\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to such improvements; and\n\u00b7\nA third-party manufacturer may gain knowledge from working with us that could be used to supply one of our competitors with a product that competes with ours.\nIf our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver our product candidates for clinical investigation and, if approved, for commercial sale on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be required to delay or suspend development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, our clinical trials must be conducted with product that complies with cGMP. Failure to comply may require us to repeat or conduct additional preclinical and/or clinical trials, which would increase our development costs and delay the regulatory approval process and our ability to generate and grow revenues.\nIn addition, any significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and key materials that are used to manufacture our product candidates. Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements for the commercial production of a number of these key materials which are used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing clinical study could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials for our product candidates after regulatory approval, the commercial launch of our product candidates could be delayed or there could be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates, if approved.\nEach of these risks, if realized, could delay or have other adverse impacts on our clinical trials and the approval and commercialization of our product candidates, potentially resulting in higher costs, reduced revenues or both.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing drug products and currently have no internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. While we intend to have a role in the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, we do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to develop global sales and marketing capabilities for all of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies that have sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, a strategic interest in the products under development, and the ability to successfully market and sell our products. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with the necessary expertise. We cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, as well as the terms of our agreements with such third parties, which cannot be predicted at this early stage of our development. We cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to market and sell our products in the United States or overseas.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and licensees to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have an active patent protection program that includes filing patent applications on new compounds, formulations, delivery systems and methods of making and using products and prosecuting these patent applications in the United States and abroad. As patents issue, we also file continuation applications as appropriate. Although we have taken steps to build a strong patent portfolio, we cannot predict:\n\u00b7\nthe degree and range of protection any patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our licensed patents;\n\u00b7\nif and when patents will issue in the United States or any other country;\n\u00b7\nwhether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our licensed patents and patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwhether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose;\n\u00b7\nwhether any of our patents will be challenged by our competitors alleging invalidity or unenforceability and, if opposed or litigated, the outcome of any administrative or court action as to patent validity, enforceability or scope;\n\u00b7\nwhether a competitor will develop a similar compound that is outside the scope of protection afforded by a patent or whether the patent scope is inherent in the claims modified due to interpretation of claim scope by a court;\n\u00b7\nwhether there were activities previously undertaken by a licensor that could limit the scope, validity or enforceability of licensed patents and intellectual property; or\n\u00b7\nwhether a competitor will assert infringement of its patents or intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, and what the outcome of any related litigation or challenge may be.\nOur success also depends upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors, sublicensees and contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. To this end, we require all employees to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired, and our business and competitive position would suffer.\nDue to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights, we may not have meaningful protection from competition.\nOur long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our patent rights, and the patent rights of biopharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. These uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or may obtain in the future could be subject to challenge, and even if not challenged, may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition. Patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute, and any dispute could be resolved against us.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAmerica Invents Act\u201d), the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity or ownership of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings. The America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and enforcing patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States are and could remain less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may be less likely to be able to prevent third parties from infringing our patents in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products that infringe our patents in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and be forced to defend against litigation and pay damages.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u00b7\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7\nstop using the subject matter claimed in patents held by others, which could cause us to lose the use of one or more of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\npay damages; or\n\u00b7\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose and that could result in a substantial diversion of our management resources.\nAlthough we have not received any claims of infringement by any third parties to date, we expect that as our product candidates move further into clinical trials and commercialization and our public profile is raised, we may be subject to such claims.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is very speculative and involves a very high degree of risk.\nTo date, we have generated no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from a research agreement with a minority stockholder and interest on bank account balances and short-term investments. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $154,687,242 and $140,318,712 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net losses of $14,368,530 and $25,294,503, respectively, partially as a result of expenses incurred through a combination of research and development activities related to the various technologies under our control and expenses supporting those activities. Until we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our drugs and will not have product revenues.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our relationships with our licensors or other strategic partners;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights and regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u00b7\ndevelopments and market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nFurther, the stock market, in general, and the market for biotechnology companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance and which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nWe will require additional capital funding the receipt of which may impair the value of our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our research, development, sales and marketing activities. We will need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt offerings or through arrangements with strategic partners or other sources in order to continue to develop our product candidates. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available when needed or on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends to our stockholders in the past, and we do not anticipate paying dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, to fund the continuing operation of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, you will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock until and unless you sell your shares at a profit.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and direct our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 92665, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "REXN"}
