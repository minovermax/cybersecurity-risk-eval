{"cik": "1747009", "company": "Equitrans Midstream Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors (and related summary) should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. The following discussion of risk factors, including the summary, contains forward-looking statements. The summary below is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this section.\nThe risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information, including the full set of risk factors set forth in this section, should be read in conjunction with \"Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the financial statements and accompanying notes included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\u2022We depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues and therefore are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity could adversely affect us.\n\u2022Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation, and the lack of diversification of our assets and geographic locations, could further adversely affect us.\n\u2022The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging and has significantly impacted, and in the future could impact, our and the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain all approvals necessary to complete certain projects on time or at all. If we do not complete expansion projects and/or identify and complete inorganic growth opportunities, our future growth may be limited.\n\u2022Reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets and equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture have resulted in and could result in significant impairment charges.\n\u2022Cyberattacks aimed at us or third parties, as well as any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and/or data privacy, could materially adversely affect us.\n\u2022Increasing scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations for ESG matters and sustainability practices may adversely affect us.\n\u2022Our business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks and physical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\n\u2022We face and will continue to face opposition to and negative public perception regarding the development of our expansion projects and the operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.\n\u2022Our subsidiaries' significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under our subsidiaries' debt agreements, could adversely affect us.\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and any financing transactions may increase our financial leverage or cause dilution to our shareholders. A further downgrade of EQM\u2019s credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\n\u2022Increased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel or energy sources, could have a negative impact on customer throughput and the demand for our services and could limit our ability to grow.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in the ordinary course of our business.\n\u2022We may not be able to realize the expected investment return under certain of our existing contracts, or renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all.\n\u2022The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and its variant strains (or any future pandemic) could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities may become unavailable to transport or process natural gas.\n\u2022Joint ventures that we have entered into (or may in the future enter into) might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management\u2019s time and our resources. We do not exercise control over our joint venture partners, and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests.\n\u2022Acquisitions that we may make could reduce, rather than increase, our results of operations and liquidity, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\n\u2022Expanding our business by constructing new midstream assets subjects us to risk, and we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\n\u2022Significant portions of our pipeline systems have been in service for several decades, and we are subject to numerous hazards and operational risks. We do not own all of the land on which our assets are located, which could disrupt our operations and future development.\n\u2022The loss or disengagement of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our plans.\n\u2022Our exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\n\u2022Our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation. Changes in or additional regulatory measures, and related litigation, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of adverse events and increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime or as a result of increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\n\u2022For the taxable years prior to January 1, 2021, the tax treatment of EQM depended on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat EQM as a corporation or if EQM becomes subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation, it would reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay dividends to our shareholders.\n\u2022We face certain risks related to the tax treatment of EQM and any potential audit adjustment to EQM's income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017.\n\u2022Our stock price has fluctuated and may further fluctuate significantly and your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents and Pennsylvania law could impair an attempt to acquire us and our exclusive forum provision in our governing documents could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\n\u2022Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares issued as part of the EQM Merger and the related Restructuring present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Separation\n\u2022We continue to face risks related to the Separation, including among others, those related to U.S. federal income taxes, contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation, EQT's obligations under certain Separation-related agreements and potential indemnification liabilities.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues. Therefore, we are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any decrease in EQT's drilling or completion activity (or significant production curtailments) could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nHistorically, we have provided EQT a substantial percentage of its natural gas gathering, transmission and water services. EQT accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenues from EQT for the foreseeable future, including as a result of the EQT Global GGA.\nGiven the scope of our business relationship with EQT, any event, whether in our areas of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects EQT's production, financial condition, leverage, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect us. Accordingly, we are subject to the business risks of EQT, including the following:\n\u2022prevailing and projected commodity prices, primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs);\n\u2022natural gas price volatility or a sustained period of low commodity prices, and EQT\u2019s utilization of financial hedges, which may have an adverse effect on, as applicable, EQT\u2019s drilling operations, revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, creditworthiness and liquidity;\n\u2022decisions of EQT\u2019s management in respect of curtailing natural gas production, choke management, timing of turning wells in line, and rig and completion activity;\n\u2022a reduction in or slowing of EQT\u2019s anticipated drilling and production schedule, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our services;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital to fund EQT\u2019s operations and any changes in EQT\u2019s credit ratings and the effects of EQT\u2019s credit support obligations on such availability;\n\u2022the costs of producing natural gas and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews and other equipment;\n\u2022infrastructure capacity constraints and interruptions;\n\u2022geologic considerations;\n\u2022risks associated with the operation of EQT\u2019s wells and facilities, including potential environmental liabilities;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to identify exploration, development and production opportunities based on market conditions;\n\u2022uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production, levels of reserves, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable, to optimize existing well production and to sustain production, including by use of large-scale, sequential, highly choreographed drilling and hydraulic fracturing, including combo and return-to-pad development;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability or intention to develop additional reserves not covered by our assets or obligations to build;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated efficiencies associated with its strategic plan, execute on additional strategic transactions, if any, and continue to execute on its de-levering plan;\n\u2022adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing (including limitations in respect of engaging in hydraulic fracturing in specific areas), the potential removal of certain federal income tax deductions with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development or additional state taxes on natural gas extraction, changes in tax laws and negative public perception regarding EQT\u2019s operations;\n\u2022the loss of key personnel and/or the effectiveness of their replacements;\n\u2022EQT\u2019s ability to achieve its ESG and sustainability targets; and\n\u2022risks associated with cybersecurity, environmental activists and other threats.\nEQT may reduce its capital spending in the future based on various factors, including corporate capital allocation strategies, regional takeaway constraints, commodity prices or other factors. Unless we are successful in attracting significant new customers, our ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported or gathered under service arrangements on our gathering, transmission and storage and water systems will depend on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated a significant amount of its acreage to us, and executed long-term contracts with substantial firm reservation and MVCs on our systems, it may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of our current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it, and other than the firm reservations and MVCs, it is under no contractual obligation to maintain its production dedicated to us. Moreover, as disclosed on December 13, 2021, EQT\u2019s corporate capital allocation strategy continues to focus on capital efficiency, reducing indebtedness to achieve investment grade metrics, returning capital to its shareholders and free cash flow generation as opposed to volume growth. A reduction in the capacity subscribed or volumes transported or gathered on our systems by EQT (or sustained lack of growth in respect of such volumes) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAs discussed under the heading \"Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation, whether as a result of producer corporate capital allocation strategies, lower regional natural gas prices, regional takeaway constraints, and/or other factors, have adversely affected, and in the future could adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\" in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are a number of factors that could cause EQT and other producers to elect to reduce or maintain then-current levels of drilling activity or curtail production. Any sustained reductions in development or production activity in our areas of operation, particularly from EQT, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, the execution of the EQT Global GGA was based upon assumptions, including regarding EQT\u2019s forecasted drilling and production levels and volumes on our system, that our management believed appropriate at the time of execution. If any of the assumptions fail to be realized or actual results differ from those assumptions, as has occurred in respect of, for example, the targeted full in-service date for the MVP, our ability to fully achieve the benefits we believed associated with the EQT Global GGA at the time of its execution, as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, may be adversely affected. Further, if EQT's volumetric volumes on our systems do not meet levels we assumed at the time of executing the EQT Global GGA and, during the period of such lower volumes, gathering fee reductions take effect in connection with the full in-service date of the MVP as required under the EQT Global GGA, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be adversely affected. See \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDecreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation, whether as a result of producer corporate capital allocation strategies, lower regional natural gas prices, regional takeaway constraints, and/or other factors, have adversely affected, and in the future could adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nOur business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in our areas of operation and the production and development plans of our customers are impacted by various factors, including prices for natural gas and NGLs, which fluctuate, corporate capital allocation strategies, and regional takeaway constraints.\nPrices for natural gas and NGLs, including regional basis differentials, have previously adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the timing of development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by our pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects our water services business, and the creditworthiness of our customers. Lower natural gas prices, particularly in the Appalachian region, have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, certain producers, including certain of our customers, to determine to reduce or hold generally steady their rig count (and thereby delay or not increase production), delay turning wells in line, temporarily shut in portions of their production or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which when effected by our producer customers reduces the demand for, and usage of, our services. For instance, temporary production curtailments effected in 2020 by EQT and certain other of our customers resulted in a decrease in our volumetric-based fee revenues for portions of 2020. An extended period of low natural gas prices and/or instability in natural gas prices in future periods, especially in the Appalachian region, or other factors could cause EQT or other producers to take similar actions in the future, which could have a significant negative effect on the demand for our services, and therefore our results of operations.\nAdditionally, although natural gas prices have increased from 2020 lows as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, higher natural gas prices have not caused our largest customers to increase their production forecasts and, even if natural gas prices remain elevated, our customers may announce in the future lower, flat or modest increases to production forecasts based on various factors, which could include regional takeaway capacity limitations, access to capital, investor expectations regarding free cash flow, a desire to reduce or refinance leverage or other factors. See, for example, \u201cWe depend on EQT for a substantial majority of our revenues. Therefore, we are subject to the business and liquidity risks of EQT, and any decrease in EQT\u2019s drilling or completion activity (or significant production curtailments) could adversely affect our business and operating results.\u201d in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such decisions by our customers affect production levels and, accordingly, demand for our services and therefore our results of operations. Additionally, lower regional natural gas prices (including regionally), corporate capital allocation strategies or regional takeaway constraints could cause producers to determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of our current areas of operation are strategically more attractive to them. Further reduction, or continued lack of growth, in the natural gas volumes supplied by our producer customers could result in reduced throughput on our systems and adversely impact our business, including our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAccordingly, maintaining or increasing the contracted capacity or the volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on our systems and cash flows associated therewith is substantially dependent on our customers continually accessing additional reserves of natural gas in or accessible to our current areas of operations. For example, while EQT has dedicated production from a substantial portion of its leased properties to us, we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our gathering and transmission systems or the rate at which production from a well naturally declines over time. EQT and other producers may not develop the acreage they have dedicated to us for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, corporate capital allocation policies, producers\u2019 focus on generating free cash flow and/or de-levering, prevailing and projected energy prices, hedging strategies and environmental or other governmental regulations. Our ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas is affected by the level of successful drilling activity near our systems and our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells, and most development areas in our areas of operation are already dedicated to us or one of our competitors.\nIn addition, the amount of natural gas reserves underlying wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. We do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves connected to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our systems are less than we anticipate, or the timeline for the development of reserves is longer than we anticipate, and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf new supplies of natural gas are not obtained to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins in our areas of operation, the overall volume of natural gas gathered, transported and stored on our systems would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, has significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\nCertain of our projects require regulatory approval from federal, state and/or local authorities prior to and/or in the course of construction, including any extensions from, expansions of or additions to our and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s gathering, transmission and storage systems, as applicable. The approval process for certain projects has become increasingly slower and more difficult, due in part to federal, state and local concerns related to exploration and production, transmission and gathering activities and associated environmental impacts, and the increasingly negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, including major pipeline projects like the MVP and MVP Southgate. Further, regulatory approvals and authorizations, even when obtained, have increasingly been subject to judicial challenge by activists requesting that issued approvals and authorizations be stayed and vacated.\nAccordingly, authorizations needed for our projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, may not be granted or, if granted, such authorizations may include burdensome or expensive conditions or may later be stayed or revoked or vacated, as has been the case with certain authorizations in the past, including, most recently, in January and February 2022 with respect to certain approvals for the MVP project that the Fourth Circuit vacated.\nIn addition, significant delays in the regulatory approval process for projects, as well as stays and losses of critical authorizations and permits, including for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, have significantly increased costs and delayed the targeted in-service dates for the projects, and further delays may cause similar adverse effects. Significant delays, such as that caused by the vacatur in January and February 2022 of certain approvals for the MVP project by the Fourth Circuit, and cost increases in turn could adversely affect our ability, and, in the case of the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, the ability for the MVP Joint Venture and its owners, including us, to achieve expected investment returns, adversely affect our willingness or ability and/or that of our joint venture partners to continue to pursue projects, and/or further cause other-than-temporary declines in value to the Company's equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture. The MVP and MVP Southgate projects in particular are subject to several agency actions and judicial challenges (and will likely become subject to further actions and challenges), as described in more detail in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \"Strategy\" under \"Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions\" in \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee that the MVP Joint Venture will ultimately (or timely) receive all necessary authorizations or that such authorizations will be maintained in effect following challenge, or even after projects are placed in service. Even if the MVP Joint Venture does succeed in resolving challenges or restoring or obtaining the necessary permits and other authorizations, this may not occur within the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s then-targeted time frame for placing projects in service, prior to placing projects in service, or enable the MVP Joint Venture to meet the then-targeted project costs.\nWe have experienced and may further experience increased opposition from activists in the form of lawsuits, intervention in regulatory proceedings and otherwise, which has been and/or may be focused on the few remaining portions of the MVP project and which have resulted in significant, adverse decisions in respect of project authorizations. Such opposition has made it increasingly difficult to complete the project and place it in service within the then-targeted time frame or at all and, following any in-service, may also affect the ability to continue operating or effect extensions and/or expansions of the project. Further, such opposition and/or adverse court rulings and regulatory determinations may have the effect of increasing that risk that at a future point joint venture partners may elect not to continue to pursue or fund the project, which would, absent additional project sponsors, significantly imperil the ability to complete the project. See \"We have entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management's time and our resources. In addition, we exercise no control over joint venture partners and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture's best interest and these joint ventures are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we are subject.\" in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also expect that other projects, such as the MVP Southgate, may be subject to similar heightened opposition. These and other challenges to our projects, particularly the MVP project, could adversely affect our business (including by increasing the possibility of investor activism), financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe gathering fees payable by EQT to us set forth in the EQT Global GGA are subject to potential reductions for certain contract years set forth in the EQT Global GGA, conditioned to begin the first day of the quarter in which the full in-service date of the MVP occurs, which provide for estimated aggregate fee relief of approximately $270 million in the first twelve-month period, approximately $230 million in the second twelve-month period and approximately $35 million in the third twelve-month period. In addition, given that the MVP full in-service date did not occur by January 1, 2022, EQT has an option, exercisable through December 31, 2022, to forgo approximately $145 million of the gathering fee relief in such first twelve-month period and approximately $90 million of the gathering fee relief in such second twelve-month period in exchange for the EQT Cash Option. Among the benefits to us pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, EQT is subject to an initial annual MVC of 3.0 Bcf per day that became effective on April 1, 2020, which annual MVC gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day through December 2031 following the full in-service date of the MVP. Delays in the MVP full in-service date affect our ability to achieve benefits associated with the execution of the EQT Global GGA. See \u201cEQT Global GGA\u201d in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nReviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets and equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture have resulted in significant impairment charges, and reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets and equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture could result in future significant impairment charges.\nGAAP requires us to perform an assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount.\nWe may perform either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of potential impairment. Our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary. Under this elective process, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or\ncircumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative analysis is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis. If we choose not to perform a qualitative assessment, or if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred, then we will perform a quantitative assessment. In the case of a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated and compare it to the carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge to goodwill is recognized for the excess of the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.\nAssessing goodwill for potential impairment requires significant judgments and estimates by management. Fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is recorded is estimated using a combination of an income and market approach which, in the case of the income approach, applies significant inputs not observable in the public market (Level 3), including estimates and assumptions related to the use of an appropriate discount rate, future throughput volumes, the application of contractual terms providing for fee credit as necessary, operating costs, capital spending and changes in working capital, and, in the case of the market approach, applies metrics and multiples derived from comparable companies and reference transactions. The reporting unit to which goodwill is recorded as of December 31, 2021 is the EQM Opco reporting unit (as defined and discussed in Note 4). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reporting units and impairment previously recognized.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management\u2019s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable (meaning, in the case of equity method investments, that such investments have suffered other-than-temporary declines in value). With respect to property, plant and equipment and finite lived assets, asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. These cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, commencement of operations, resolution of relevant legal and regulatory matters, and other factors. If the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. The determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to evaluations of recoverability and the recognition of additional impairments. The evaluation and measurement of impairments for equity method investments involves similar uncertainties, judgments and estimates as those applicable to other long-lived assets. If the equity method investment carrying value exceeds the fair value and it is determined that the decline in value is other-than-temporary, we will recognize an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The fair value of equity method investments is generally estimated using an income approach under which significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows, the appropriate discount rate and probability-weighted scenarios.\nEstimates and assumptions used in reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets and equity method investments are inherently subjective, subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial and other risks, and require complex judgments. If actual results differ from the estimates or if assumptions are not realized (or if estimates or assumptions, such as of the probability of success of the projects to which an equity method investment relates, change), we may be required to recognize an impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $486.7 million of goodwill (all associated with the EQM Opco reporting unit) and $9.7 billion of other long-lived assets, which will be monitored for future impairment.\nIf the operations or projected operating results of our businesses decline, we could incur additional goodwill, intangible asset, and property, plant and equipment impairment charges. Further, if we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets is not recoverable or the value associated with our equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture has further suffered an other-than-temporary decline, we would also incur additional impairment charges. Future impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recorded. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment.\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and \u201cOutlook-Potential Future Impairments\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional information.\nCyberattacks aimed at us or third parties, as well as any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and/or data privacy, could materially adversely affect us.\nWe have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure, and cloud applications, to conduct our business, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. We depend on both our own systems, networks, and technology as well as the systems, networks and technology of our vendors, customers and other business partners. Our increasing reliance on digital technologies puts us at greater risk for system failures, disruptions, incidents, and cyberattacks, which could significantly impair our ability to conduct our business. For instance, energy industry participants, including midstream companies, have been the victims of ransomware attacks, and we expect to continue to be targeted by cyberattacks as a critical infrastructure company.\nThe U.S. government has continued to issue public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyberattacks, and in May and July 2021, the TSA issued security directives (and subsequent amendments/revisions thereto) applicable to certain midstream companies requiring such companies to comply with mandatory reporting measures and undertake a number of specific cybersecurity enhancements for both IT and OT systems. We have been required and may further be required to expend additional resources as a result of current or new laws, regulations, directives or other requirements related to critical infrastructure cybersecurity. Any failure to remain in compliance with laws or regulations governing cybersecurity, including the TSA security directives, may result in penalties, fines, enforcement actions, or mandated changes in our practices, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWhile we and our third-party service providers commit resources to the design, implementation and monitoring of our IT and OT systems, there is no guarantee that our cybersecurity measures will provide absolute security. Despite these measures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or prevent all cyberattacks or incidents, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until launched, and because attackers are increasingly using tactics, techniques, and procedures designed to circumvent controls and avoid detection. As a result, our IT and OT systems (or those of third parties) that are designed to protect against cyber risks may not prevent or detect all cyberattacks or incidents, and deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events or incidents affecting, our systems or infrastructure or the systems or infrastructure of third parties could, depending on the extent or duration of the event, materially adversely affect us, including by leading to corruption, misappropriation or loss of our proprietary and sensitive data, delays (which could be significant) in the performance of services for our customers, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, regulatory scrutiny, personal injury or death, property damage and other operational disruptions, as well as damage to our reputation, financial condition and cash flows and potential legal claims and liabilities. Like other companies in the natural gas industry, we have identified and expect to continue to identify cyberattacks and incidents on our systems, but none of the cyberattacks and incidents we have identified to date has had a material impact on our business or operations.\nFurther, as cyberattacks continue to evolve and increase in sophistication and volume, we have expended, and expect to continue to expend, additional resources relating to cybersecurity, including, as applicable, to continue to modify or enhance our preventive, protective, and response measures and/or to investigate and remediate potential vulnerabilities to or consequences of cyberattacks and incidents. There can be no assurance that any preventive, protective, response, or remedial measures will address or mitigate all threats that arise.\nThe regulatory landscape with regard to data privacy continues to develop. New laws and regulations governing data privacy, as well as any unauthorized disclosure of personal information, may potentially increase our compliance costs. Any failure by us, a company that we acquire, or one of our technology service providers, to comply with these laws and regulations, where applicable, could adversely affect us, including by resulting in reputational harm, penalties, regulatory scrutiny, liabilities, legal claims and/or mandated changes in our business practices.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations in respect of ESG and sustainability practices may adversely impact our business and our stock price and expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Investor advocacy groups, proxy advisory firms, certain institutional investors and lenders, investment funds and other influential investors and rating agencies are also increasingly focused on ESG and sustainability practices and matters and on the implications and social cost of their investments and loans. Stakeholders\u2019 increased focus and activism related to ESG and sustainability matters may potentially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, as well as our stock price, and expose us to new or additional risks, including as described below.\nIncreased focus on ESG and sustainability matters, particularly with respect to climate change and related demand for renewable and alternative energy, may, among other things, hinder our access to capital given our fossil fuel-based operations and/or adversely affect demand for our services. See \u201cOur business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks (including evolving climate-focused regulation and climate change-driven trends emphasizing financing non-fossil fuel businesses and prompting pursuit of emissions reductions, lower-carbon technologies and alternative forms of energy) and\nphysical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\u201d and \u201cIncreased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel or energy sources, could negatively impact demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial results.\u201d under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, pipeline infrastructure companies and projects, such as our MVP project, face increased legal scrutiny and risk, including litigation risk and enhanced and lengthier regulatory reviews by federal, state and/or environmental regulators, due to an increased focus on climate change and/or environmental justice policies and the fossil fuel industry.\nWe recognize that our shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, and other stakeholders expect us to continue to focus on long-term sustainable performance, including by addressing significant, relevant ESG factors, further working to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainability. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs and capital expenditures in doing so, and certain of such future costs and capital expenditures could be material. Further, if we do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards (or meet sustainability targets that we set), which are evolving, or if we are perceived not to have responded appropriately or quickly enough to growing concern for ESG and sustainability issues even if our actions are regulatorily and legally compliant, our business could suffer, including from reputational damage (and negative public perception regarding us or our industry may lead to additional regulatory scrutiny or other adverse developments). Additionally, activist shareholders may submit proposals to promote an ESG-related position. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations, causing reputational harm, and diverting the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies.\nIn addition, as we continue to focus on long-term sustainable performance and address ESG factors, and as disclosure standards continue to evolve, including as a result of potential regulatory initiatives, we have expanded and expect to further expand our public disclosures in these areas. Such disclosures may reflect aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions, including over long timelines, which aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates, and other expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized. Failure to realize (or timely achieve progress on) such aspirational goals, targets, cost estimates, and other expectations or assumptions may adversely impact us. Further, a multitude of organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG and sustainability matters. Such ratings and reports are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or perceptions of us or our industry as a result of such ratings or our ESG and sustainability practices, may lead to increased negative investor and other stakeholder sentiment toward us or our customers, and to the allocation of investment capital to other industries and companies, which could negatively affect our stock price and access to and costs of capital.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or our stock price.\nOur business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks (including evolving climate-focused regulation and climate change-driven trends emphasizing financing non-fossil fuel businesses and prompting pursuit of emissions reductions, lower-carbon technologies and alternative forms of energy) and physical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\nCombating the effects of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and internationally, including from regulators, legislators, companies in a variety of industries, financial market participants and other stakeholders. Numerous proposals have been made and will likely continue to be made to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs, as well as to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Accordingly, our business and operations, and those of our producer customers, are subject to executive, regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with natural gas and the emission of GHGs.\nWhile no comprehensive climate change legislation has been enacted at the federal level in the United States as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, President Biden has made addressing climate change a priority of his administration, including by issuing in January 2021 an executive order recommitting the United States to the United-Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement\u201d (an international agreement for nations to limit GHG emissions) and announcing in April 2021 that the United States will target a 50-52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. Accordingly, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry and legislation relating to climate change are likely. Moreover, federal regulators have taken (or announced that they plan to take or are contemplating) actions related to GHG regulations that have or may have a significant influence on our operations, including the EPA\u2019s November 2021 proposed rule to regulate methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources and the FERC's ongoing evaluation of how to\ntreat GHGs for purposes of its environmental and certificate reviews. For additional information on GHG laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to us, see \"Regulatory Environment\" and \"Environmental Matters\" under \"Item 1. Business.\"\nThe U.S. Congress, regulatory bodies and various states also have been evaluating and/or have implemented climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of GHGs, including the establishment of market-based cap-and-trade or carbon pricing programs or imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities. For example, certain Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states in which we and/or the MVP Joint Venture operate, participate, and others are considering participating, in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (RGGI) aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which could in turn lead to increased uncertainty with regard to demand for natural gas used in the generation of electricity.\nPennsylvania, which is home to our headquarters and many of our assets, approved Environmental Quality Board Final Rulemaking #7-599: CO2 Budget Trading Program (\u201cRGGI Rules\u201d) on September 1, 2021. This rulemaking would establish a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants and would authorize Pennsylvania to participate in RGGI. The RGGI Rules will not become effective until they are published by Pennsylvania\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau (\u201cLRB\u201d). Under Pennsylvania\u2019s Regulatory Review Act, the LRB must provide the General Assembly time to review and reject the rulemaking before publishing the final rules. The Pennsylvania Senate and House passed concurrent resolutions disapproving the implementation of the RGGI Rules. However the Pennsylvania Governor vetoed those resolutions on January 10, 2022, leaving the Pennsylvania General Assembly with the opportunity to override that veto. The ongoing legislative review process means that the final RGGI Rules may not be promulgated until the second quarter of 2022, at the earliest. Additionally, it is anticipated that the RGGI Rules, if promulgated, will face legal challenges, which cast further uncertainty over the timing and implementation of the RGGI Rules.\nBeyond Pennsylvania, it is likely that such regional and state efforts will continue and may establish additional requirements in states in which our assets are located regardless of federal action. For example, with respect to the footprints of MVP and MVP Southgate projects, North Carolina is considering rulemaking to join RGGI and Virginia currently is a member of RGGI. Virginia's recently elected governor, however, has issued an executive order calling on the state to begin the process of withdrawing from RGGI and rescinding its RGGI regulations. GHG restrictions, if implemented, may result in additional compliance obligations or taxes, and initiatives such as RGGI may adversely affect demand for natural gas and, therefore, negatively impact our producer customers, and in turn, the demand for our services. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThere remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing, scope and potential impact of future action in the United States and internationally with respect to GHG emissions, including methane in particular. Although we continue to monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments in this area to assess potential impacts on our operations and otherwise take efforts and invest funds proactively to limit and reduce GHG emissions from our facilities, we cannot predict precisely what form future laws, regulations and legal requirements relating to climate change might take. Nor can we predict the stringency of any such requirements, when they might become effective or their exact effect on us. Further, laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to climate change are constantly changing or being reinterpreted, and this may occur during the permitting and construction phases of our projects (which may last several years), as has been the case with our MVP and MVP Southgate projects. Generally, development and implementation of processes to comply with changing legal requirements is likely to be costly and time consuming. Further, compliance or noncompliance with existing or new climate change-focused regulations or other initiatives could adversely impact us by, among other things, imposing additional compliance obligations such as new emission control requirements, taxing the release of GHGs, causing longer permitting timelines, requiring that we purchase allowances for emissions, exposing us to regulatory penalties or affecting our reputation. Future laws, regulations and legal requirements designed to reduce GHG emissions also could make some of our activities, or those of our customers, uneconomic or less economically advantageous to maintain or operate, which may affect the estimated fair values of underlying assets and results of operations. Further, such future legislation and/or regulation may reduce the number of attractive business opportunities available to us. Additionally, climate change-focused regulations may adversely affect production of or demand for natural gas (such as by increasing the cost of producing natural gas or prompting consumers to use renewable fuels), which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although future laws, regulations and legal requirements relating to climate change could have a material impact on our industry and us, attempts at quantification are based on speculation of what may occur in the future. For example, based on several bills proposing the establishment of a carbon tax or carbon pricing that have been drafted across various jurisdictions, our preliminary estimate in 2021 of the potential increase in our operating cost upon the enactment of a carbon tax or carbon pricing ranged from approximately $2 million to approximately $96 million reflecting an assumed cost of carbon range and our estimated metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2020. However, these and any\nother estimates we may make taking into account potential future laws, regulation or legal requirements are necessarily uncertain.\nLitigation risks relating to climate change also are increasing. Parties have brought suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for resultant roadway and infrastructure damages. Parties have also alleged that these companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors and consumers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. While we are not currently party to any such litigation, we or our customers could be named in future actions given that our business involves natural gas. Further, climate change-related factors may prompt governmental investigations or adversely affect the regulatory approval process for the construction and operation of midstream assets as, for example, opposition parties have cited our GHG operational emissions as a specific concern during comment periods for regulatory permit reviews.\nMarket forces driven by concern for climate change are affecting (and are expected to continue to affect) the availability and cost of capital to companies in the fossil fuel sector. For example, climate change activists continue to direct their attention towards, among other things, sources of funding for fossil fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or adding more burdensome terms to or altogether eliminating their investments in, or lending with respect to, fossil fuel energy-related activities and companies. Further, such institutions are increasingly allocating funds to those industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices. Certain financial institutions, including some that are lenders under the Amended EQM Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11), have voluntarily adopted policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector, and there is also a risk that financial institutions will in the future be required to adopt such policies. These market forces may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future (and thus our pursuit of initiatives, such as growth projects) or achieve increases in our stock price, and these forces may also adversely affect our customers, which could result in, among other things, increased counterparty risk and/or decreased demand for our services. Further, demand for and development of lower carbon technologies and renewable and alternative energy is increasing as a result of concern regarding climate change, which may adversely affect demand for natural gas and accordingly our producer customers.\nIn addition to such transitional risks, climate change also may create physical risks to our business. Climate impacts, such as increasing temperatures, changing weather patterns, and more frequent or intense floods and storms, can pose serious challenges for our facilities, supply chains, employees, contractors, current and potential customers, and the communities in which we operate. In particular, our operations are primarily focused in the Appalachian Basin, which is a rain-susceptible region. Severe and repeated rainfall events above and beyond historical estimates and magnitudes because of climate change could cause damage to our physical assets, especially facilities located in low-lying areas near streams and riverbanks and pipelines situated in landslide-prone and rain susceptible regions, which may adversely affect our operations. We may not be able to pass on resultant higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks or repairing damage due to such events. Further, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the resilience of our facilities and the effectiveness of planning for disaster preparedness and response and business continuity, which plans may not fully encompass every potential climate-driven eventuality. Additionally, changing climate patterns could impact the demand for energy in the regions we currently and plan to serve. For example, extreme warm weather in the winter months may lead to decreased natural gas usage, which may affect our results of operations.\nOne or more of any such developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nNegative public perception regarding us, MVP, MVP Southgate, other of our expansion projects, the midstream industry, and/or the natural gas industry in general have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our operations and business, and negative public perception may increase the likelihood of governmental initiatives aimed at the natural gas industry.\nNegative public perception regarding us, the MVP, MVP Southgate, other of our expansion projects, other industry participants and their projects and actions, the midstream industry and/or the natural gas industry in general resulting from, among other things, climate change, oil or produced water spills, gas and other hydrocarbon leaks, the explosion or location of natural gas transmission and gathering lines and other facilities, erosion and sedimentation issues, unpopular expansion projects, environmental justice concerns, and general concerns raised by activists about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects (as well as specific concerns raised in respect of particular pipeline projects), has led to, and may in the future lead to, increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new local, state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, enforcement interpretations and/or adverse judicial rulings or regulatory actions. See the sections captioned \"Regulatory Environment\" and \"Environmental Matters\" under \"Item 1. Business\" as well as \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d These actions have caused, and may continue to cause, operational delays or restrictions, increased construction and operating\ncosts, penalties under construction contracts, additional regulatory burdens and increased litigation. As discussed under \u201cThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, has significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects,\u201d there are several pending challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project that affect the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project, as applicable. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could further cause the permits we and the MVP Joint Venture need to complete the expansion projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, and to conduct our and its respective operations to be denied, removed, withheld, delayed, stayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our and its respective abilities to profitably conduct business or make it more difficult to obtain the real property interests needed in order to operate relevant assets or complete planned growth projects, which could, among other adverse effects, affect project completion or subsequent operation, result in revenue loss or a reduction in our and the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s customer bases.\nAdditionally, there have been initiatives at the federal, state and local levels aimed at the natural gas industry, including those to restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Adoption of legislation or regulations (which may be prompted by negative public perception) placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities or other limitations with respect to the natural gas industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur subsidiaries have significant amounts of debt outstanding under the Amended EQM Credit Facility, the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11) and the senior unsecured notes issued by EQM. The respective debt agreements of EQM and Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream, contain various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit EQM\u2019s and Eureka\u2019s, as applicable, ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022make distributions on or redeem or repurchase units;\n\u2022incur or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022enter into burdensome agreements, subject to certain specified exceptions;\n\u2022enter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and\n\u2022dispose of all or substantially all of their respective assets.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Amended EQM Credit Facility and the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility. The Amended EQM Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants, that, among other things, establish for EQM a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended EQM Credit Facility) that varies over the course of the term ranging from not more than 5.95 to 1.00 to not more than 5.00 to 1.00, with the then-applicable ratio being tested as of the end of each fiscal quarter (which in limited circumstances may be increased for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). Under the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility, Eureka is required to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.25 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). Additionally, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, Eureka may not permit the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to Consolidated Interest Charges (as defined in the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility) to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. EQM\u2019s and Eureka\u2019s ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond their respective control and we cannot assure our shareholders that EQM or Eureka will continue to meet these covenants. In addition, the Amended EQM Credit Facility and the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility each contain certain events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control.\nThe provisions of the debt agreements may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply\nwith the provisions of the debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable creditors to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of the debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and in turn our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments. The Amended EQM Credit Facility and the 2021 Eureka Credit Facility each contain a cross default provision that applies to a default related to any other indebtedness the applicable borrower may have with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25 million as to EQM, and $10 million as to Eureka.\nWe and our subsidiaries may in the future incur additional debt. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 levels of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders may be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt;\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our subsidiaries\u2019 current, or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future, respective debts, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our subsidiaries\u2019 current, or our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future, indebtedness, as applicable, or our operating results affect our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements, we will be forced to take actions such as seeking modifications to the terms of our debt agreements, reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to timely effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 current substantial indebtedness and the additional debt we and/or our subsidiaries will incur in the future for, among other things, working capital, repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, acquisitions or operating activities may adversely affect our liquidity and therefore our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, which could result in increased costs for us to access the capital markets. Any future additional downgrade of the debt issued by EQM could increase our capital costs or adversely affect our operating flexibility or ability to raise capital in the future. See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit rating changes, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, our ability to obtain financing in the future may be adversely affected by market forces driven by concern for climate change. See \u201cOur business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks (including evolving climate-focused regulation and climate change-driven trends emphasizing financing non-fossil fuel businesses and prompting pursuit of emissions reductions, lower-carbon technologies and alternative forms of energy) and physical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\u201d in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we or our subsidiaries are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to execute our business strategy and pay dividends to our shareholders may be diminished. Additionally, financing transactions may increase our financial leverage or could cause dilution to our shareholders.\nIn order to grow and maintain our asset base and complete expansion projects, including the MVP and MVP Southgate projects, we will need to continue to make significant capital expenditures and capital contributions. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures and capital contributions, we will be unable to grow or maintain our business operations, which impacts our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIn order to fund our capital expenditures and capital contributions, as well as potential strategic transactions, if any, we may use cash from our operations, incur borrowings under our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities or through debt capital market transactions, enter into our own credit arrangements or sell additional shares of our equity or a portion of our assets. Using cash from operations will reduce the cash we have available to pay dividends to our shareholders. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to\nobtain or maintain bank financing or to access the capital markets for debt offerings, or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity offerings, may be limited by, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings, as applicable, the covenants in our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, the rights and preferences governing the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, the status of the MVP project, general economic conditions, market conditions in our industry, changes in law (including tax laws), and other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Additionally, market forces are affecting (and are expected to continue to affect) the availability and cost of capital to companies in the fossil fuel sector. See \u201cOur business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks (including evolving climate-focused regulation and climate change-driven trends emphasizing financing non-fossil fuel businesses and prompting pursuit of emissions reductions, lower-carbon technologies and alternative forms of energy) and physical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\u201d in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEven if we or our subsidiaries are successful in obtaining funds through debt or equity financings, as applicable, the terms thereof could limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and otherwise adversely affect us, such as by requiring additional or more restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions or, in the case of debt, requiring that collateral be posted to secure such debt. In addition, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage thereby limiting our ability to further borrow, and issuing additional equity may result in significant common shareholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current dividend rates, which could materially decrease our ability to pay dividends at the then-current dividend rates. If funding is not available to us or our subsidiaries when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to execute our business plans, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which (or actions taken to attempt to address any such funding issue) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nA further downgrade of EQM\u2019s credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\nAs of February 23, 2022, EQM\u2019s credit ratings were Ba3 with a negative outlook, BB- with a stable outlook and BB with a negative outlook from Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch, respectively. EQM\u2019s credit ratings have fluctuated (and may further fluctuate) depending on, among other things, EQM\u2019s leverage, uncertainty around the full in-service date of the MVP project and the credit profile of our customers.\nEQM\u2019s credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM\u2019s customers. Credit rating agencies perform an independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. This analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, operational risks, various financial tests, ESG matters, as well as analysis of various financial metrics. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time.\nIf any credit rating agency further downgrades or withdraws EQM\u2019s ratings, including for reasons relating to the MVP project (such as for delays in the targeted full in-service date of the MVP project or increases in such project\u2019s targeted costs), EQM\u2019s leverage or credit ratings of our customers, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 respective access to the capital markets could become more challenging, borrowing costs will likely increase, our operating flexibility may be adversely affected, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurance (the amount of which may be substantial), including the Cash Option Letter of Credit (as discussed in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"), in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease.\nIn order to be considered investment grade, EQM must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody\u2019s, BBB- or higher by S&P and BBB- or higher by Fitch. EQM\u2019s non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted in greater borrowing costs, including under the Amended EQM Credit Facility, and increased collateral requirements, including under the MVP Joint Venture\u2019s limited liability company agreement, than if EQM\u2019s credit ratings were investment grade.\nIn addition to causing, among other impacts, higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive terms associated with modifications to existing debt instruments, any further downgrade could also require additional or more restrictive covenants on future\nindebtedness that impose operating and financial restrictions on us or our subsidiaries, certain of our subsidiaries to guarantee such debt and certain other debt, and certain of our subsidiaries to provide collateral to secure such debt.\nAny increase in our financing costs resulting from a credit rating downgrade, and/or more restrictive covenants or the pledging of security, could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations. If a credit rating downgrade and/or a resultant collateral requirement were to occur at a time when we are experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lack liquidity, our business, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nThe lack of diversification of our assets and geographic locations could adversely affect us.\nWe rely exclusively on revenues generated from our gathering, transmission and storage and water systems, substantially all of which are located in the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Due to our lack of diversification in assets and geographic location and continuing challenges to completing expansion projects such as the MVP and MVP Southgate, an adverse development in these businesses or our areas of operations, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events, pandemics, epidemics, weather, regulatory action, local prices, producer liquidity, decreases in demand for natural gas from the Appalachian Basin or increases in supply of natural gas (such as if associated gas production were to continue to recover and return to or exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels) could have a more significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our ability to pay dividends than if we maintained more diverse assets and locations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our counterparties in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from the nonpayment and/or nonperformance of our customers, suppliers, joint venture partners and other counterparties as further described in \u201cCredit Risk\u201d under \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\u201d We extend credit to our customers as a normal part of our business. While we have established credit policies, including assessing the creditworthiness of our customers as permitted by our FERC-approved natural gas tariffs, and may require appropriate terms or credit support from them based on the results of such assessments, including in the form of prepayments, letters of credit, or guaranties, we may not adequately assess the creditworthiness of our existing or future customers. Pursuant to the EQT Global GGA and the Credit Letter Agreement, amongst other things, (a) we agreed to relieve certain credit posting requirements for EQT, in an amount up to approximately $250 million under its commercial agreements with us, subject to EQT maintaining a minimum credit rating from two of three rating agencies of (i) Ba3 with Moody\u2019s, (ii) BB- with S&P and (iii) BB- with Fitch. As of February 23, 2022, EQT\u2019s public debt had sub-investment grade credit ratings of BB+ with a positive outlook at S&P, Ba1 with a stable outlook at Moody\u2019s, and BB+ with a stable outlook at Fitch. Periods of natural gas price declines and sustained periods of low natural gas and NGL prices, previously have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of our customers, including their ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts. For example, the low commodity price environment in 2019 and 2020 negatively impacted natural gas producers causing some producers significant economic stress including, in certain cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to seek renegotiated contracts. We cannot predict the extent to which the businesses of our counterparties would be impacted if commodity prices decline, commodity prices are depressed for a sustained period of time, or other conditions in the energy industry were to deteriorate, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on the abilities of our customers to perform under their gathering, transmission and storage and water services agreements with us. To the extent one or more of our counterparties is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these counterparties may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Bankruptcy Code). Nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our counterparties and/or any unfavorable renegotiation or rejection of contracts under the Bankruptcy Code could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur future growth may be limited if we do not complete expansion projects and/or identify and complete suitable acquisitions and other strategic transactions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom, and we face and will continue to face opposition to the development of our expansion projects and the operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to grow organically depends primarily upon our ability to complete expansion projects, such as the MVP and MVP Southgate projects (and related expansions thereof), that result in an increase in the cash we generate. We may be unable to complete successful, accretive expansion projects for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022an inability to identify attractive expansion projects;\n\u2022an inability to obtain and/or maintain necessary rights-of-way, real-estate rights or permits or other government approvals, including approvals by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022an inability to successfully integrate the infrastructure we build with our existing systems;\n\u2022an inability to obtain and/or maintain sources of fresh water;\n\u2022an inability to raise financing for expansion projects on economically acceptable terms;\n\u2022incorrect assumptions about volumes, revenues, costs and in-service timing, as well as potential growth; or\n\u2022an inability to secure or maintain adequate customer commitments to use the newly expanded facilities.\nAdditionally, we face and expect to continue to face staunch opposition to the development of expansion projects (such as the MVP project) and operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, local, regional and national groups opposed to the natural gas industry and/or fossil fuels generally, activists and other advocates. Such opposition has taken and will likely continue to take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block, vandalize or sabotage our development or operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets directly or indirectly, lawsuits, legislation or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business.\nAny event that delays or interrupts (or continues to delay or interrupt) the completion of expansion projects, and/or revenues generated, or expected to be generated, by our operations or that causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe also periodically evaluate inorganic growth opportunities, including additional interests in existing joint ventures. There is no guarantee that we will be able to identify, compete for and/or complete, suitable strategic transactions, or, in the case of any such strategic transaction, achieve synergies or other potential benefits. See also \u201cAcquisitions that we may make could reduce, rather than increase, our results of operations and liquidity, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\u201d in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFailure to achieve growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nExpanding our business by constructing new midstream assets subjects us to risks.\nOur growth strategy includes organic and greenfield growth projects. The development and construction of pipeline infrastructure and storage facilities and the optimization of such assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control, and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital and expose us to risks. Those risks include the failure to meet customer contractual requirements; delays caused by landowners; delays caused by advocacy groups or activists opposed to the natural gas industry through lawsuits or intervention in regulatory proceedings; environmental hazards; vandalism; adverse weather conditions; the performance of third-party contractors; delays caused by evolving regulatory or legal requirements; the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials (or escalating costs in respect thereof) and the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained). These types of projects may not be completed on schedule, within budgeted cost, or, in the case of the MVP Joint Venture may continue to be delayed and exceed the budgeted cost, or at all. For example, public participation, including by pipeline infrastructure opponents, in the review and permitting process of projects, through litigation or otherwise, can introduce uncertainty and adversely affect project timing, completion and cost. See also \u201cThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, has significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\u201d in Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, civil protests regarding environmental justice and social issues, including proposed construction and location of infrastructure associated with fossil fuels, may lead to increased litigation, legislative and regulatory initiatives and review at federal, state, tribal and local levels of government that could prevent or delay the construction of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues.\nAdditionally, construction expenditures on projects may occur over an extended period, yet we will not receive revenues from, or realize any material increases in cash flow as a result of, the relevant project until it is placed into service. Moreover, our cash flow from a project may be delayed or may not meet our expectations. Furthermore, we may construct facilities to capture\nanticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return. Such issues in respect of the construction of midstream assets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to numerous hazards and operational risks.\nOur business operations are subject to the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas and performance of water services. These operating risks, some of which we have experienced and/or could experience in the future, include but are not limited to:\n\u2022damage to pipelines, facilities, equipment, environmental controls and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, abnormal amounts of rainfall, floods and flash flooding, fires, droughts, landslides and other natural disasters and acts of sabotage, vandalism and terrorism;\n\u2022inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022uncontrolled releases of natural gas and other hydrocarbons or of fresh, mixed or produced water;\n\u2022leaks, migrations or losses of natural gas as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities and, with respect to storage assets, as a result of undefined boundaries, geologic anomalies, natural pressure migration and wellbore migration;\n\u2022ruptures, fires and explosions;\n\u2022pipeline freeze offs due to cold weather; and\n\u2022other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution to the environment and suspension of operations.\nAny such events, certain of which we have experienced, and any of which we may experience in the future, could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment or interruption, which could be significant, of our operations, regulatory investigations and penalties and substantial losses to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. The location of certain segments of our systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks. Accidents or other operating risks have resulted, and in the future could result, in loss of service available to our customers. Potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our systems include, but are not limited to, limitations on our ability to satisfy customer contractual requirements, obligations to provide reservation charge credits to customers in times of constrained capacity and solicitation of our existing customers by third parties for potential new projects that would compete directly with our existing services. Such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to retain customers, as well as potentially negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIncreased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage, and water services, or from alternative fuel or energy sources, could negatively impact demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. Our systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities in the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may be better positioned to compete, including if the midstream industry moves towards greater consolidation; further, some of such competitors may now, or in the future, have access to greater supplies of natural gas or water than we do. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, transmission and storage systems and water systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may develop or acquire their own gathering, transmission or storage, or water services instead of using ours.\nThe policies of the FERC promoting competition in natural gas markets continue to have the effect of increasing the natural gas transmission and storage options for our customer base. As a result, we have experienced, and in the future could experience, \u201cturnback\u201d of firm capacity as existing agreements expire. If we are unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, we may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of natural gas transported or stored on our systems or, in cases where\nwe do not have long-term firm contracts, could force us to lower our transmission or storage rates. Increased competition could also adversely affect demand for our water services.\nFurther, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and, increasingly, renewable and alternative energy. Demand for and development of renewable and alternative energy is increasing as a result of concern regarding climate change. Further, renewable and alternative energy continues to become more cost competitive with fossil fuels, including natural gas, and is growing more widely available. Continued increases, whether driven by regulation or consumer preferences, in the demand for renewable and alternative energy at the expense of natural gas (or increases in the demand for other sources of energy, particularly if prices for natural gas significantly increase relative to other forms of energy as fuel) could adversely affect our producer customers and lead to a reduction in demand for our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nAll of these competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers and/or attract new customers and/or additional volumes from existing customers as we seek to maintain and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, competition, including from renewable and alternative energy, could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by our systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all.\nOne of our exposures to market risk occurs at the time our existing contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. Based on total projected contractual revenues, including projected contractual revenues from future capacity expected from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed for which we have executed firm contracts, our firm gathering contracts and firm transmission and storage contracts had weighted average remaining terms of approximately 14 years and 13 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the level of existing and new competition to provide services to our markets; the macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas economics for our current and potential customers; the balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets; the extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis or require capacity on our systems; and the effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers and us. For more information related to contracting practices applicable to us see \u201cRegulatory Environment - FERC Regulation\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nAny failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts or to extend or replace our more significant contracts, or extending or replacing contracts at unfavorable or lower rates or with lower or no associated firm reservation fee revenues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 and its variant strains (or any future pandemic) could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions caused by pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19 and variants thereof, could materially affect the domestic and global economy, the natural gas industry, and/or us. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 and variant strains will continue to spread and the effects of such continued spread.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the further impact of the COVID-19 outbreak (or any other outbreak) on the domestic economy, the natural gas industry, and/or us; however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected in numerous ways, including, without limitation, that:\n\u2022demand for natural gas could be adversely affected, as was the case in 2020, which could negatively affect prices and forward prices for natural gas and our customers, including their development plans and, consequently, lead to curtailments or otherwise decrease demand for our services or heighten our exposure to customer risk;\n\u2022our operations, or those of our customers or suppliers, may be disrupted or become less efficient if a significant number of employees or contractors are unavailable due to illness;\n\u2022we, our customers and suppliers may be adversely affected due to the continued constraints on global supply chains resulting from the outbreak and may be adversely affected if the outbreak causes further or long delays in access to or\nincreases to cost of inventory, equipment or other items necessary to our, our customers\u2019 or our suppliers\u2019 respective businesses;\n\u2022legal and regulatory processes relevant to our operations may be disrupted or slowed, such as if relevant governmental authorities suffer reduced workforce availability due to the virus; and\n\u2022resultant disruption to, and instability in, financial and credit markets may adversely affect our access to capital, leverage and liquidity levels and credit ratings, as well as our counterparties\u2019 access to capital, business continuity, financial stability, leverage and liquidity levels and credit ratings (which could heighten counterparty credit risk to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of our business).\nFurther, we could be affected by governmental mandates and responses to the pandemic. See \u201cThe loss or disengagement of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.\u201d in this Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough we believe that we are following best practices under COVID-19 guidance and intend to continue to refine our practices as additional guidance is released, there is no guarantee that efforts by us or any other entity or authority to mitigate potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, whether on a local, state or national level, will be effective.\nWe also may incur additional costs to further attempt to mitigate potential impacts caused by COVID-19 related disruptions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak (including federal, state and local governmental responses, broad economic impacts and market disruptions) has heightened and may further heighten many of the other risks set forth herein. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on us will continue to depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, appearance or escalating circulation of new strains of the virus (including those with potential immune evasion or escape mutations), duration of the outbreak, and related economic effects and aftereffects (including on the natural gas industry), and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact, including vaccine acceptance and mandates.\nWe may not be able to increase our customer throughput and resulting revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to grow.\nOur ability to increase our customer-subscribed capacity and throughput and resulting revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including competition from third-party producers\u2019 existing contractual obligations to competitors, the location of our assets relative to those of competitors for potential producer customers, and the extent to which we have available capacity when and where shippers require it. To the extent that we lack available capacity on our systems for volumes, or we cannot economically increase capacity, we may not be able to compete effectively with third-party systems for additional natural gas production in our areas of operation.\nOur efforts to attract new customers or larger commitments from existing customers may be adversely affected by our desire to provide services pursuant to long-term firm contracts and contracts with MVCs. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements which could require volumetric exposure or potentially direct commodity exposure, and we may not be willing to agree to such other forms of contractual arrangements.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide receipt and delivery options to and from our transmission and storage system. For example, our transmission and storage system interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Texas Eastern, Dominion Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and ET Rover Pipeline, LLC, as well as multiple distribution companies. Similarly, our gathering systems have multiple delivery interconnects to multiple interstate pipelines. In the event that our access to such systems is impaired, the amount of natural gas that our gathering systems can gather and transport previously has been, and in the future would be, adversely affected, which has in the past reduced and could, as applicable, reduce revenues from our gathering activities as well as transmission and storage activities. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these or any other pipeline connections or facilities were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to operate efficiently and continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, as has occurred in the past. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or facility could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nA substantial majority of the services we provide on our transmission and storage system are subject to long-term, fixed-price \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts that are subject to limited or no adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, our costs could exceed our revenues received under such contracts, we could be unable to achieve the expected investment return under such contracts, and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nIt is possible that costs to perform services under \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts could exceed the negotiated rates we have agreed to provide to our customers. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by our systems and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to a \u201cnegotiated rate,\u201d and that contract must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97% of the contracted firm transmission capacity on our system was subscribed under such \u201cnegotiated rate\u2019\u2019 contracts. Unless the parties to these \u201cnegotiated rate\u201d contracts agree otherwise, the contracts generally may not be adjusted to account for increased costs that could be caused by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nWe have entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management\u2019s time and our resources. In addition, we exercise no control over joint venture partners and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests and these joint ventures are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we are subject.\nWe have entered into joint ventures to construct the MVP and MVP Southgate projects and a joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream, and may in the future enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties. Joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. Joint venture arrangements and dynamics can also divert management and operating resources in a manner that is disproportionate to our ownership percentage in such ventures. Because we do not control all of the decisions of the MVP Joint Venture or the joint venture relating to Eureka Midstream, it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing that we fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may not control, and our joint venture partners may not act in a manner that we believe would be in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests, may elect not to support further pursuit of projects, and/or may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture. The loss of joint venture partner support in further pursuing or funding a project may significantly adversely affect the ability to complete the project. In addition, the operations of the MVP Joint Venture, Eureka Midstream and any joint ventures we may enter into in the future are subject to many of the same operational risks to which we are subject. For example, we may not be able to obtain financing at, or in respect of, a joint venture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAcquisitions that we may make could reduce, rather than increase, our results of operations and liquidity, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAny completed acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022failure to realize assumptions about volumes, revenues, capital expenditures and costs, including synergies and potential growth;\n\u2022an inability to secure or maintain adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;\n\u2022an inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets, and we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns in a manner that is disproportionate to the relative size and impact of, or ownership percentage in, such acquired assets or entities; and\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties operating a larger organization or in new geographic areas, with new joint venture partners or new business lines.\nIf risks such as the above are realized, or if an acquisition fails to be accretive over the long term to our cash generated from operations on a per share basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business, including certain environmental accidents that might occur as well as many cyber events. In addition, we do not maintain business interruption insurance of the types and in amounts necessary to cover all possible risks of loss, like project delays caused by pandemics, cyberattacks, governmental action or inaction. The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe currently maintain excess liability insurance that covers our and our affiliates\u2019 legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury, personal injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use, to third parties. This excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability but excludes: release of pollutants subsequent to their disposal; release of substances arising from the combustion of fuels that result in acidic deposition; and testing, monitoring, clean-up, containment, treatment or removal of pollutants from property owned, occupied by, rented to, used by or in the care, custody or control of us and our affiliates. We also maintain coverage for us and our affiliates for physical damage to assets and resulting business interruption, including certain damage caused by cyberattacks.\nMost of our insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the types and in the amounts we desire at reasonable rates, and we may elect to self-insure a portion of our asset portfolio. The insurance coverage we have obtained or may obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. In addition, for pre-Distribution losses, we share insurance coverage with EQT, and we will remain responsible for payment of any deductible or self-insured amounts under those insurance policies. To the extent we experience a pre-Distribution loss that would be covered under EQT\u2019s insurance policies, our ability to collect under those policies may be reduced to the extent EQT erodes the limits under those policies.\nSignificant portions of our pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions, or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime, associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nSignificant portions of our transmission and storage system and FERC-regulated gathering system have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these systems could result in adverse events, or increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities. Any such adverse events or any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or downtime, or related loss of revenue, due to the age or condition of our systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe loss or disengagement of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.\nOur operations are dependent upon key management, technical and professional personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services and skills of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, the success of our operations depends, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain experienced personnel. There is increased competition for experienced technical and other professionals, primarily in the corporate services functions, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel. Additionally, a lack of employee engagement could lead to increased employee burnout, loss of productivity, increased propensity for errors, increased employee turnover, increased absenteeism, increased safety incidents and decreased customer satisfaction, which may in turn negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot identify, attract, develop, retain and engage key management, technical and professional personnel, along with other qualified employees, to support the various functions of our business, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOn November 4, 2021, OSHA issued the ETS to carry out President Biden\u2019s executive order requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to produce a negative test result at least once a week. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted an application to stay the ETS pending disposition of the applicants' petitions for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Effective January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the ETS as an enforceable emergency temporary standard, but did not withdraw the ETS as a proposed rule.\nShould the ETS, or a similar state or local requirement, take effect in the future, the Company expects it would be subject to such regulation concerning COVID-19 vaccination or testing. In that case, the Company may be required to implement a requirement that many or most employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions, or be tested. Such a mandate may result in increased costs, operational disruptions or employee attrition for the Company, which could be material. If we lose employees, it may be difficult in the current competitive labor market to find replacement employees, and this could have an adverse effect on future operations, revenues and costs, which could be material. Accordingly, implementation of and complying with the ETS or a similar state or local requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 64%, 66% and 58%, respectively, of our operating revenues were generated from firm reservation fees. Although our goal is to execute long-term firm reservation fee and MVC contracts with new or existing customers in the future, our efforts to obtain such contractual terms may not be successful. In addition, we may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that do not provide services primarily based on capacity reservation charges or other fixed fee arrangements and therefore may have a greater exposure to fluctuations in customer volume variability driven by commodity price risk than our current operations. Significantly greater exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices, including regional basis differentials with regard to natural gas prices, as a result of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, the EQT Global GGA provides for potential cash bonus payments payable by EQT to us during the period beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter in which the MVP full in-service date occurs through the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024 (the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision). The fair value of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision is largely determined by estimates of the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas forward price curve, and payments are conditioned upon the quarterly average of certain Henry Hub natural gas prices exceeding certain price thresholds. Based on the Henry Hub natural gas forward strip prices as of February 18, 2022 and the terms of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, any adverse change in assumptions regarding the MVP project may further decrease the estimated fair value of the derivative asset attributable to the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, and such decrease may be substantial. Such changes in estimated fair value, if any, would be recognized in other (expense) income, net, on our statements of consolidated comprehensive income and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations and future development.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, and we have been, and in the future could be, subject to more onerous terms, and/or increased costs or delays, in retaining necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way or easements, if such rights-of-way or easements lapse or terminate or if our facilities are not properly located within the boundaries of such rights-of-way or easements. Although many of these rights are perpetual in nature, we occasionally obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. As has been the case in the past, if we were to be unsuccessful in negotiating or renegotiating rights-of-way or easements, we might have to institute condemnation proceedings on our FERC-regulated assets or relocate our facilities for non-regulated assets. The FERC has announced a policy that would presumptively stay the effectiveness of certain future construction certificates, which may limit when we are able to exercise condemnation authority. It is possible that the U.S. Congress may amend Section 7 of the NGA to codify the FERC's presumptive stay or otherwise limit, modify, or remove the ability to utilize condemnation. A loss of rights-of-way or easements or a relocation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Additionally, even when we own an interest in the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, agreements with correlative rights owners have caused us to, and in the future may require that we, relocate pipelines and facilities or shut in storage systems and facilities to facilitate the development of the correlative rights owners\u2019 estate, or pay the correlative rights owners the lost value of their estate if they are not willing to accommodate development.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nOur natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes in or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities, and related litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nOur interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC under the NGA and the NGPA and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Certain portions of our gathering operations are also currently regulated by the FERC in connection with our interstate transmission operations. Our FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to our customers. The FERC\u2019s authority extends to a variety of matters relevant to our operations. For additional information, see \u201cRegulatory Environment-FERC Regulation\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment-FERC Regulation of Gathering Rates and Terms of Service\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nPursuant to the NGA, existing interstate transmission and storage rates, terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Additionally, rate increases, changes to terms and conditions of service and contracts proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be protested and such actions can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. We currently hold authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) \u201crecourse rates,\u201d which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff, (ii) \u201cdiscount rates,\u201d which are rates below the \u201crecourse rates\u201d and above a minimum level, (iii) \u201cnegotiated rates,\u201d which involve rates that may be above or below the \u201crecourse rates,\u201d provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement, and (iv) market-based rates for some of our storage services from which we derive a small portion of our revenues. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 97% of our contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under our tariff, rather than recourse, discount or market-based rate contracts. There can be no guarantee that we will be allowed to continue to operate under such rates or rate structures for the remainder of those assets\u2019 operating lives. Customers, the FERC or other interested stakeholders, such as state regulatory agencies, may challenge our rates offered to customers or the terms and conditions of service included in our tariffs. We do not have an agreement in place that would prohibit customers, including EQT or its affiliates, from challenging our tariffs. Any successful challenge against rates charged for our transmission and storage services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nAny changes to the FERC\u2019s policies regarding the natural gas industry may have an impact on us, including the FERC\u2019s approach to pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as interstate pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transmission capacity and transmission and storage facilities. The FERC and Congress may continue to evaluate changes in the NGA or new or modified FERC regulations or policies that may impact our operations and affect our ability to construct new facilities and the timing and cost of such new facilities, as well as the rates we charge our customers and the services we provide.\nA significant construction project generally requires review by multiple governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any agency\u2019s delay in the issuance of, or refusal to issue, authorizations or permits, issuance of such authorizations or permits with unanticipated conditions, or the loss of a previously-issued authorization or permit, for one or more of these projects may mean that we will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that we did not anticipate. Such delays, refusals or resulting modifications to projects could materially and negatively impact the revenues and costs expected from these projects or cause us to abandon planned projects. For example, see \u201cDevelopments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d and \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d for a discussion of certain such regulatory matters relevant to the MVP and the MVP Southgate projects.\nFailure to comply with applicable provisions of the NGA, the NGPA, federal pipeline safety laws and certain other laws, as well as with the regulations, rules, orders, restrictions and conditions associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties. For example, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately $1.3 million (adjusted periodically for inflation) per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the NGPA or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes.\nIn addition, future federal, state or local legislation or regulations under which we will operate our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage businesses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental and other laws and regulations that expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could exceed our expectations and affect our business. The current laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change and in the future we may be subject to additional or revised laws, regulations and legal requirements, that could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. For additional information on laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to us, see \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d Laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business, including relating to the environmental protection, health and safety, as well\nas climate change, have, among other things, increased, and in the future could continue to increase, our cost of compliance and doing business, including costs related to planning, designing, permitting, constructing, installing, operating, updating and/or abandoning gathering, transmission and water systems and pipelines, as well as storage systems. The need to comply with such laws, regulations and other legal requirements, and incidents of noncompliance, whether by us or third parties with whom we engage, has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, such as by, among other things and as applicable, resulting in costly delays, operating restrictions and diversion of management time and resources in evaluating the ability to pursue projects, such as when new or additional permits or alternative construction methods are required. For example, as discussed under \u201cThe regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, has significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\u201d, there are several pending applications for and/or challenges to certain aspects of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project that affect the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project, as applicable, including those litigation and regulatory-related delays discussed in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or other legal requirements, including required permits and other approvals, could subject us to, among other things, claims for personal injuries, property damage and other damages and, even if as a result of factors beyond our control and irrespective of our fault, could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages that could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. The risk of our incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations is significant given our handling of natural gas, produced water and other hydrocarbons, as well as air emissions related to our operations. Risk is also present as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices, and our handling of waste. These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and could affect our business in many ways. For example, an accidental release from one of our pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance. Further, we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities that are acquired into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.\nLaws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business also are constantly changing, and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming. As an example, the FWS receives hundreds of petitions to consider listing of additional species as endangered or threatened and is regularly sued or threatened with lawsuits to address these petitions. Some of these legal actions have resulted, and may in the future result, in the listing of species located in our operating areas. Such designations of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species has adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our assets or projects. Additionally, as discussed under \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d, federal and state governments and agencies, including states where we operate, have made advancing environmental justice a priority. A significant number of current environmental justice initiatives focus on enhancing public participation in permitting and other project development-related decisions. We have been, and in the future may be, the target of objections to permits before state and federal agencies and related litigation brought by individuals or advocacy organizations that are purporting to raise environmental justice issues. In addition, various federal agencies, including EPA and DOJ, have announced plans to seek out opportunities to address environmental justice issues through federal enforcement actions. Revised or additional laws, regulations or legal requirements (or interpretations thereof) that result in increased compliance costs, litigation or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, or affect our customers\u2019 production and operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nFor information related to risks associated with laws and regulations concerning climate change, see \u201cOur business is subject to climate change-related transitional risks (including evolving climate-focused regulation and climate change-driven trends emphasizing financing non-fossil fuel businesses and prompting pursuit of emissions reductions, lower-carbon technologies and alternative forms of energy) and physical risks that could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital costs, adversely affect our customers\u2019 development plans, and reduce demand for our products and services.\u201d\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of adverse events or increasingly stringent pipeline safety regulation, including pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs.\nThe DOT, acting through PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could harm high population areas, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. The regulations require operators, including us, to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high population area; maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigating actions. PHMSA has also recently adopted regulations extending existing design, operational and maintenance, and reporting requirements to onshore gathering pipelines in rural areas.\nChanges to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a material adverse effect on us. For more information on the laws, regulations and risks applicable to us, see \u201cRegulatory Environment-Pipeline Safety and Maintenance\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d\nThe adoption of legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing and the enactment of new or increased severance taxes and impact fees on natural gas production could cause our current and potential customers to reduce the number of wells they drill in the Marcellus and Utica Shales or curtail production of existing wells. If reductions are significant for those or other reasons, the reductions would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOur assets are primarily located in the Marcellus Shale fairway in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia and the Utica Shale fairway in southeastern Ohio, and a substantial majority of the production that we receive from customers is produced from wells completed using hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells, particularly in unconventional resource plays like the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and similar agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process, including the EPA, which finalized effluent limit guidelines allowing zero discharge of wastewater from shale gas extraction operations to publicly owned treatment plants in 2016 in addition to existing limits on direct discharges. Additionally, in response to increased public concern regarding the alleged potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, while a number of states, including those in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, have imposed fees on the drilling of new unconventional oil and gas wells. Some states have elected, and other states could elect, to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. The Biden Administration temporarily banned new leases for oil and gas drilling on federal lands in January 2021, but that ban was subsequently blocked by a federal court. Also, certain local governments have adopted, and others may adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Further, several federal governmental agencies have conducted reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. For example, in December 2016, the EPA issued its final report on a study it had conducted over several years regarding the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. EPA has more recently sought input from states and stakeholders on approaches to management of wastewater produced from oil and gas extraction at onshore facilities, and published a summary of the input it received in May 2020. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity (induced seismicity). In a few instances, operators of injection disposal wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. While Pennsylvania is not one of the states where such regulation has been enacted, regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on our customers.\nThe adoption of new laws, regulations, ordinances, or executive actions at the federal, state or local levels imposing more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas wells, increase customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our gathering, transmission and storage, or water services.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, rules and regulations that affect our customers are subject to change. For example, Pennsylvania\u2019s governor has previously proposed legislation to impose a state severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, including natural gas produced from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, either in replacement of or in addition to the existing state impact fee. Pennsylvania\u2019s legislature has not thus far advanced any of the governor\u2019s severance tax proposals; however, severance tax legislation may continue to be proposed in future legislative sessions. Any such tax increase or change could adversely impact the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our customers and cause them to reduce their drilling in the areas in which we operate, which could negatively impact demand on our gathering, transmission and storage, and water services.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Us\nFor the taxable years prior to January 1, 2021, the tax treatment of EQM depended on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the IRS were to treat EQM as a corporation or if EQM becomes subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state or foreign tax purposes for any open taxable year prior to January 1, 2021, it would reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nPrior to the EQM Merger, EQM was a publicly traded partnership and the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our shares depended largely on EQM being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which requires that 90% or more of EQM\u2019s gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Code. As a result of the EQM Merger, the requirements under Section 7704 of the Code are no longer applicable to EQM for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020.\nDespite the fact that EQM is a limited partnership under Delaware law and has not elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it is possible, under certain circumstances, that the IRS could determine on audit for taxable years prior to January 1, 2021 for EQM to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. For example, EQM would be treated as a corporation if the IRS determined that less than 90% of EQM\u2019s gross income for any such taxable year consisted of qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.\nIf EQM was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year prior to January 1, 2021, EQM would be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate applicable to the relevant tax year and would likely pay state income taxes at varying rates. Distributions to us after the Separation Date would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to us. Treatment of EQM as a corporation could result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow in the year of the payment to the IRS, potentially causing, among other things, a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM\u2019s income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from EQM, in which case we may be required, and potentially former unitholders would be required, to reimburse EQM for such payments or, if EQM is required to bear such payments, such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to EQM\u2019s income tax return for tax years beginning after 2017, the IRS (and some states) may assess and collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable interest and penalties) directly from EQM. EQM will have a limited ability to shift any such tax liability to its general partner and unitholders, including us, in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that EQM will be able to do so under all circumstances, or that EQM will be able to effect corresponding shifts in state income or similar tax liability resulting from the IRS adjustment in states in which EQM does business in the year under audit or in the adjustment year. As a result of the EQM Merger, we own all of the EQM common units. If EQM makes payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments with respect to tax periods beginning after 2017 and before 2021, we and potentially former unitholders may be required to reimburse it for such payment or, if EQM is required to bear such payments, such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIn the event the IRS makes an audit adjustment to EQM\u2019s income tax returns and EQM does not or cannot shift the liability to its unitholders in accordance with their interests in EQM during the year under audit, EQM will generally have the ability to\nrequest that the IRS reduce the determined underpayment by reducing the suspended passive loss carryovers of EQM\u2019s unitholders (without any compensation from EQM to such unitholders), to the extent such underpayment is attributable to a net decrease in passive activity losses allocable to certain partners. Such reduction, if approved by the IRS, will be binding on any affected unitholders.\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. General market fluctuations, industry factors, such as climate change-related transitional risks, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, as well as factors specific to our business, have caused and could also continue to cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, cash dividends, strategic transactions or other market expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly. Additionally, our stock price may be adversely affected by transactions in our common stock by significant shareholders, including EQT.\nWe expect that EQT will ultimately dispose of its ownership interest in us, representing approximately 5.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021, when it deems appropriate, but in no event later than November 12, 2023. There can be no assurance regarding the method by which EQT will dispose of its interest in or the actual timing of any such disposal.\nHowever, any disposition by EQT, or any other significant shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Further, any delay by EQT in completing the disposition of its ownership interest in us could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock, which could affect investor confidence in us.\nA reduced stock price affects, among other things, our cost of capital and could affect our ability to execute on future strategic transactions, as well as increase opportunities for investor activism or unsolicited third-party activity affecting us.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock, and we may further reduce the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock or may not pay any cash dividends at all to our shareholders. Our ability to declare and pay cash dividends to our shareholders, if any, in the future will depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe are not required to declare and pay dividends to our common shareholders, and our Board previously has reduced, and in the future may decide to further reduce, the amount of the cash dividend that we pay on our common stock or may decide not to declare any dividends in the future. Although we have in the past paid regular cash dividends, any payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, our leverage, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. We are also not entitled to pay any dividends on any junior securities, including any shares of our common stock, prior to paying the quarterly dividends payable to the holders of Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, including any previously accrued and unpaid dividends.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future we may issue common stock or other equity to raise cash for our projects, operations, acquisitions or other purposes and may also acquire interests in other companies or assets by using one or more of cash, debt and/or our equity.\nAny of these events may dilute your ownership interests in us, reduce our earnings per common share and have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The issuance of these new shares and the sale of additional shares from time to time could have the effect of depressing the market value for our common stock. The increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the issuance of other equity of us, and any resulting dilution, may cause holders to sell shares of our common stock or may create the perception that such sales may occur, either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market value of, our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in us may also be diluted because of equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees or otherwise as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions or capital market transactions. Our Management Development and Compensation Committee and our Board have authority to grant share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefit plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per common share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we issue share-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock that have such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nAs more fully described under \u201cThe Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares by virtue of their terms and preferences present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock.\u201d, upon the occurrence of certain events or the passage of time, the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares may be converted by the holder or us, as applicable, initially on a one-for-one basis in the case of certain conversions by holders, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments and an adjustment for any dividends that have accrued but not been paid when due and partial period dividends. If we or a holder of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares convert Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares into common stock, the conversion will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair an attempt to acquire us.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of us deemed undesirable by our Board. These include provisions:\n\u2022authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022specifying that our shareholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and prohibiting our shareholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of proposals by our shareholders for business to be conducted at shareholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board; and\n\u2022controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board and shareholder meetings and election and appointment of our directors.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of us. As a Pennsylvania corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Pennsylvania law, including certain provisions of Chapter 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (PBCL), which, among other things, requires enhanced shareholder approval for certain transactions between us and a shareholder who is a party to the transaction or is treated differently from other shareholders and also prevents persons who become the beneficial owner of shares representing 20% or more of our voting power from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of our Board, and in some cases preventing consummation of the transaction for at least five years.\nAny provision of our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Third Amended and Restated Bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of us could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Bylaws designate the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless our Board otherwise determines, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of us arising pursuant to any provision of the PBCL or our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Third Amended and Restated Bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision set forth in our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nWhen applicable, this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares by virtue of their terms and preferences present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock.\nEquitrans Midstream Preferred Shares present a number of risks to current and future holders of our common stock, including a preference in favor of holders of Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares in the payment of dividends on our common stock, the risk of dilution occurring as a result of the conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares into our common stock and the ability of the holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares to vote with the holders of our common stock on most matters, as well as the risk that the holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to our organizational documents that would be adverse (other than in a de minimis manner) to any of the rights, preferences or privileges of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares.\nWe are party to a registration rights agreement with certain holders of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares pursuant to which, among other things, we gave the Investors certain rights to require us to file and maintain one or more registration statements with respect to the resale of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and the shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, and which, upon request by certain Investors party to the Registration Rights Agreement, will require us to initiate underwritten offerings for the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and the shares of our common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares and use our best efforts to cause the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares to be listed on the securities exchange on which the shares of our common stock are then listed. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIt was a condition to the Distribution that (i) a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and certain other U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation and Distribution shall not have been revoked or modified in any material respect and (ii) EQT received an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters relating to the qualification of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The IRS private letter ruling is based upon and relies on, and the opinion of counsel is based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of EQT and us, including those relating to the past and future conduct of EQT and us. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any representations or covenants contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to any IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel are breached, such IRS private letter ruling and/or opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which such IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, continues to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the opinion of counsel represented the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the IRS or any court and the IRS or a court may disagree with the conclusions in any opinion of counsel. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of an IRS private letter ruling or opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for the intended tax treatment or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail with such challenge we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to material U.S. federal income tax liability.\nEven if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, it would result in a material U.S. federal income tax liability to EQT (but not to its shareholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in EQT\u2019s stock or in the stock of us as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution, and we may be required to indemnify EQT for any such liability under the tax matters agreement entered into by EQT and us in connection with the Distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the IRS private letter ruling and opinion of counsel described above, a sufficient change in ownership of EQT or our common stock may occur which could result in a material tax liability to EQT.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that EQT entered into with us, we may be required to indemnify EQT against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to act by us or (iii) any of our representations, covenants or undertakings contained in any of the Separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that the EQM Merger or Share Purchases resulted in the Distribution and/or certain related transactions being treated as taxable transactions to EQT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to indemnify EQT for such taxes and related amounts.\nCertain contingent liabilities allocated to us following the Separation may mature, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business.\nThere are several significant areas where the liabilities of EQT may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the Distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the EQT consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group for that taxable period. Consequently, if EQT is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for a pre-Separation period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nWe or EQT may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and EQT entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement as well as various other agreements, including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and a shareholder and registration rights agreement with respect to EQT\u2019s continuing ownership of our common stock. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include indemnification related to liabilities and obligations. If EQT is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to EQT pursuant to agreements relating to the Separation and Distribution could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement with EQT provides for, among other things, provisions governing the relationship between us and EQT with respect to and resulting from the Separation. Among other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Separation, as well as those obligations of EQT assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify EQT under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. See also the discussion of potential indemnification obligations under \u201cIf the Separation and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not continue to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, EQT, and our respective shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify EQT for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\u201d", "PERMNO": 18150, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "ETRN"}
