{"cik": "804269", "company": "General Motors Financial Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are dependent upon the operations of our parent, GM.\nA material portion of our retail finance business, and substantially all our commercial lending activities, consist of financing associated with the sale and lease of new GM vehicles and our relationship with GM-franchised dealerships. If there were significant changes in GM's liquidity and capital position and access to the capital markets, the production or sales of GM vehicles to retail customers, the quality or resale value of GM vehicles, GM's operations that may require restructuring or rationalization actions, or other factors impacting GM or its products, such changes could significantly affect our profitability, financial condition, and access to the capital markets. In addition, GM sponsors special-rate financing and other incentive programs available through us. Under these programs, GM makes interest supplements or other support payments to us and may offer various incentives to borrowers who finance their vehicles with us. These programs increase our financing volume and our share of financed GM vehicle sales. If GM were to adopt marketing strategies in the future that de-emphasized such programs in favor of other incentives, our financing volume could be reduced.\nThere is no assurance that the global automotive market or GM's share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur operations are heavily reliant on automotive dealers, and our profitability could be adversely affected by a change in dealers\u2019 relationships with us or in their financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from financial products offered to or through automotive dealers. Whether we are able to originate automotive loans and leases, as well as maintain and grow our commercial lending portfolio, is dependent upon dealers' effectiveness in marketing our financial products to their retail and lease customers and select our commercial lending products over those of our competitors. As a result, our ability to cultivate and maintain strong relationships with dealers, particularly GM-franchised dealers, is essential to our operations.\nGiven the reliance of our operations on GM-franchised dealers, we have significant exposure to their financial condition. Dealers operate in a highly competitive market, and GM-franchised dealers are vulnerable to both decreased demand for new GM vehicles and periods of economic slowdown or recession. Negative changes in the financial condition of GM-franchised dealers could result in decreased loan and lease originations, reduced demand for financing of dealer inventory, construction projects and working capital, and increased defaults and net loss rates in our commercial lending portfolio, which in turn could adversely impact our profitability and financial results.\nOur ability to continue to fund our business and service our debt is dependent on a number of financing sources and requires a significant amount of cash.\nWe depend on various financing sources, including credit facilities, securitization programs and unsecured debt issuances, to finance our loan and lease originations and commercial lending business. Additionally, our ability to refinance or make payments on our indebtedness depends on our access to financing sources in the future and our ability to generate cash. Our access to financing sources depends upon our financial position, general market conditions, availability of bank liquidity, the bank regulatory environment, our compliance with covenants imposed under our financing agreements, the credit quality of the collateral we can pledge to support secured financings, and other factors. Changes in GM's and our credit ratings may also impact our access to and\nGENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.\ncost of financing. There can be no assurance that funding will be available to us through these financing sources or, if available, that the funding will be on acceptable terms. If these financing sources are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason, or we are not otherwise able to generate significant amounts of cash, then we would not have sufficient funds and would be required to revise the scale of the business, including the possible reduction or discontinuation of origination activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under existing indebtedness.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we have guaranteed a substantial amount of indebtedness incurred by our International Segment and our principal Canadian operating subsidiary. We have also entered into intercompany loan agreements with several of our International Segment subsidiaries, providing these companies with access to our liquidity to support originations and other activities. Our ability to make payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, and our ability to enter into additional credit facilities and securitization transactions as well as other debt financings, which, to a certain extent, are subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged creates risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may find it more difficult to fund future credit enhancement requirements, operating costs, tax payments, capital expenditures or general corporate expenditures;\n\u2022\nwe may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to payments on our outstanding indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to adverse general economic, industry and capital markets conditions.\nOur credit facilities may require us to comply with certain financial ratios and covenants, including minimum asset quality maintenance requirements. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other necessary or desirable business activities.\nIf we cannot comply with the requirements in our credit facilities, then the lenders may increase our borrowing costs, remove us as servicer of our securitized assets or declare the outstanding debt immediately due and payable. If our debt payments were accelerated, any assets pledged to secure these facilities might not be sufficient to fully repay the debt. These lenders may foreclose upon their collateral, including the restricted cash in these credit facilities. These events may also result in a default under our unsecured debt indentures. We may not be able to obtain a waiver of these provisions or refinance our debt, if needed. In such case, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would materially suffer.\nDefaults and prepayments on loans and leases purchased or originated by us could adversely affect our operations.\nOur financial condition, liquidity and results of operations depend, to a material extent, on the performance of loans and leases in our portfolio. Obligors under contracts acquired or originated by us, including dealer obligors in our commercial lending portfolio, may default during the term of their loan or lease. Generally, we bear the full risk of losses resulting from defaults. In the event of a default, the value of the financed vehicle or, in the case of a commercial obligor, the value of the inventory and other commercial assets we finance usually does not cover the outstanding amount due to us, including the costs of recovery and asset disposition.\nThe amounts owed to us by any given dealership or dealership group in our commercial lending portfolio can be significant. The amount of potential loss resulting from the default of a dealer in our commercial lending portfolio can, therefore, be material even after liquidating the dealer's inventory and other assets to offset the defaulted obligations. Additionally, because the receivables in our commercial lending portfolio may include complex arrangements including guarantees, inter-creditor agreements, mortgages and other liens, our ability to recover and dispose of the underlying inventory and other collateral may be time-consuming and expensive, thereby increasing our potential loss.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses on our finance receivables which reflects management's estimates of inherent losses for these receivables. If the allowance is inadequate, we would recognize the losses in excess of that allowance as an expense and results of operations would be adversely affected. A material adjustment to our allowance for loan losses and the corresponding decrease in earnings could limit our ability to enter into future financings, thus impairing our ability to finance our business.\nGENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.\nAn increase in defaults would reduce the cash flows generated by us, and distributions of cash to us from our secured debt facilities would be delayed and the ultimate amount of cash distributable to us would be less, which would have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nCustomer prepayments and dealer repayments on commercial obligations, which are generally revolving in nature, affect the amount of finance charge income we receive over the life of the loans. If prepayment levels increase for any reason and we are not able to replace the prepaid receivables with newly-originated loans, we will receive less finance charge income and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA portion of our origination and servicing activities in the North America Segment have historically involved sub-prime automobile receivables. Sub-prime borrowers are associated with higher-than-average delinquency and default rates. The actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses with respect to those borrowers could also be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. While we believe that we effectively manage these risks with our proprietary credit scoring system, risk-based pricing and other underwriting policies, and our servicing and collection methods, no assurance can be given that our methods will be effective in the future. In the event that we underestimate the default risk or underprice contracts that we purchase, our financial position, liquidity and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and competitive pressures could have a significant negative effect on our pricing, market share and operating results.\nThe automotive finance industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a large number of banks, credit unions, independent finance companies and other captive automotive finance subsidiaries. Our ability to maintain and expand our market share is contingent upon us offering competitive pricing, developing and maintaining strong relationships with dealers and customers, making substantial investments in our technological infrastructure, and effectively responding to changes in the automotive industry. In addition, any expansion into new markets may require us to compete with more experienced and established market participants. Failure to effectively manage these challenges could adversely affect our market share, and pressure to provide competitive pricing could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including supervision and licensing by numerous governmental entities. These laws and regulations can create significant constraints on our operations and result in significant costs related to compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could impair our ability to continue operating and result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses, and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\nIn the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory oversight on the financial industry and grants the CFPB extensive rulemaking and enforcement authority, all of which may substantially impact our operations. As a \u201clarger participant\u201d in the automobile finance market, we are subject to possible comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations by the CFPB. Any violations of law or unfair lending practices found during these examinations could result in enforcement actions, fines, and mandated process, procedure or product-related changes or consumer refunds.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by significant legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations in the ordinary course of our business. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could result in substantial damages, settlements, fines, penalties, diminished income or reputational harm. For a further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur profitability is dependent upon retail demand for automobiles and related automobile financing and the ability of customers to repay loans and leases, and our business may be negatively affected during times of low automobile sales, fluctuating wholesale prices and lease residual values, and high unemployment.\nGeneral We are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods also may be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, decreased demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans and leases, which weakens collateral values and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue.\nGENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.\nWhile we seek to manage these risks through the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ, no assurance can be given that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and our ability to enter into future financings.\nDemand for automobiles may also be impacted by the entrants of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry, who are disrupting the industry's historic business model through the introduction of new products, services, and methods of travel and vehicle ownership.\nWholesale Auction Values We sell automobiles returned to us at the end of lease terms either through our exclusive online channel or our wholesale auction partners. We also sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the countries where we have operations. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result in or increase a loss upon our disposition of off-lease or repossessed vehicles and, in the case of a repossessed vehicle we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency balance. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories, financial difficulties of new vehicle manufacturers, discontinuance of vehicle brands and models and increased volume of trade-ins due to promotional programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, higher gasoline prices may decrease the wholesale auction values of certain types of vehicles. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or low retail demand will result in higher losses for us.\nLeased Vehicle Residual Values and Return Rates We project expected residual values and return volumes of the vehicles we lease. At the inception of a lease, we determine the amount of lease payments we charge our lease customer based, in part, on our estimated residual value. Actual proceeds realized by us upon the sale of a returned leased vehicle at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected, which reduces the profitability of the lease transaction to us. Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the industry volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions and the quality or perceived quality, safety or reliability of the vehicles. Actual return volumes may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease-end values relative to then-existing market values, marketing programs for new vehicles and general economic conditions. All of these, alone or in combination, have the potential to adversely affect the profitability of our lease program and financial results. Further, a material decrease in the value of a leased asset group could result in an impairment charge, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nLabor Market Conditions Competition to hire and retain personnel possessing the skills and experience required by us could contribute to an increase in our employee turnover rate. High turnover or an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our delinquency, default and net loss rates, our ability to grow and, ultimately, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in minimizing risks from unfavorable changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nUnfavorable changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. We utilize various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to rate fluctuations, including entering into derivative instruments with various major financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy. However, changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates cannot always be predicted or hedged, and there can be no assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate and foreign currency risks. Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by volatility in the valuation of derivative instruments. Additionally, we may be unable to find creditworthy counterparties willing to enter derivative instruments on acceptable terms, and counterparties may be unable to meet their financial obligations under our derivative instruments.\nWe do not control the operations of our investments in joint ventures, and we are subject to the risks of operating in China.\nWe do not control the operations of our joint ventures, and we do not have a majority interest in the joint ventures. In the joint ventures, we share ownership and management with other parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint ventures. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities, as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our co-owners' interest. In joint ventures, we are required to foster our relationship with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint ventures, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint ventures may be materially adversely affected. The benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, and as such, we do not receive the full benefits from a successful joint venture. As a result of having limited control over the actions of the joint ventures, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws. Moreover, the joint ventures may not follow the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To\nGENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.\nthe extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint ventures or internal control issues arise within the joint ventures, we may have to take responsive or other actions or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the risks of operating in China. The automotive finance market in China is highly competitive and subject to significant governmental regulation. As the Chinese market continues to develop, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition, increased U.S.-China trade restrictions and weakening economic conditions in China, among other things, may result in price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gain or hold market share. In addition, business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If our joint ventures are unable to maintain their position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and/or regulations in the countries in which we do business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions, and floating-rate dealer loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to LIBOR.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculations of LIBOR after 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions, or on any other basis, after 2021.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. It is currently unknown whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance, modification or other reforms may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or floating-rate debt instruments, including our floating-rate debt. Any such discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness. Further, there is a risk that discontinuation of LIBOR, without an adequate replacement, will impact our ability to manage interest rate risk effectively.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networks owned or maintained by us, or third-party vendors or suppliers on our behalf, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and networks, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the protection of their data. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, these systems and networks may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, malware (including\nGENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.\n\u201cransomware\u201d), phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and networks. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and networks and the data that resides therein. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and networks. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. We have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were immaterial, future events may occur and may be material.\nPortions of our information technology systems and networks also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts, such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to originate receivables and service customer accounts, and may interrupt other business processes.\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing, and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers or employees are subject to increasingly complex, restrictive, and punitive regulations in all key market regions.\nUnder these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Because many of these laws are new, there is little clarity as to their interpretation, as well as a lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement. In addition, increased attention to data practices may result in the adoption of new regulations in the markets we serve. New data protection regimes are coming into effect in Brazil and China, and in the U.S., California has adopted laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding personal data. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. In some cases, these laws provide a private right of action that would allow customers to bring suit directly against us for mishandling their data.\nOur operations outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to many of the same risks as our U.S. operations. In addition to those risks, our non-U.S. operations, including the operations of our joint ventures, are subject to certain additional risks, such as the following:\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as Brazil, Mexico and China;\n\u2022\nmultiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nconsequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability to repatriate profits or transfer cash into or out of foreign countries and the tax consequences of such repatriations and transfers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, social unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the novel coronavirus, war, and terrorism; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations applicable to international operations, including anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international trade and economic sanctions laws.\nThe effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 75858, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "GM2"}
