{"cik": "1580608", "company": "Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nThe Company is subject to a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in addition to other possible adverse consequences. We operate in a continually changing business environment and, therefore, new risks emerge from time to time. The following are the risks of which we are currently aware that could be material to our business.\nBusiness Risks\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may negatively impact our results.\nWe are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown such as the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses generally increase while proceeds from auction sales decrease. These periods may also be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, decreased consumer demand for automobiles and other consumer products, and declining values of automobiles and other consumer products securing outstanding accounts, which weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default.\nAdditionally, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, reset of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, general availability of consumer credit, or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles and other consumer products as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of automobiles and other consumer products. Although declines in commodity prices, and more particularly gasoline prices, are financially beneficial to the consumer, such declines may also have a negative impact on unemployment rates in geographic areas that are highly dependent upon the oil and natural gas industry, which could adversely affect the credit quality of consumers in those areas.\nOur historical focus has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, which are associated with higher than average delinquency rates. The actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income.\nFurthermore, our business is significantly affected by monetary and regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on us through interest rate changes, costs of compliance with increased regulation, and other factors. Although market conditions have improved, conditions remain challenging for financial institutions. Furthermore, certain Eurozone member countries have fiscal outlays that exceed their fiscal revenue, which has raised concerns about such countries\u2019 abilities to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. A weakened European economy could undermine investor confidence in European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies. Notwithstanding its geographic diversification, this could adversely impact Santander, with whom we have a significant relationship. Such events could also negatively affect U.S.-based financial institutions, counterparties with which we do business, and the stability of the global financial markets. Disruptions in the global financial markets have also adversely affected the corporate bond markets, debt and equity underwriting, and other elements of the financial markets. In recent years, downgrades of the sovereign debt of some European countries have resulted in increased volatility in capital markets and have caused some lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to certain borrowers, including other financial institutions. The impact on available credit, increased volatility in the financial markets, and reduced business activity has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our businesses, capital, liquidity, or other financial conditions and results of operations and access to credit.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how those economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The degree of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates, which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process and the quality of our assets.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if our access to funding is reduced.\nWe rely upon our ability to sell securities in the ABS market and upon our ability to access various credit facilities to fund our operations. The ABS market, along with credit markets in general, experienced unprecedented disruptions during the economic downturn. Although market conditions have improved since 2009, for a number of years following the economic downturn, certain issuers experienced increased risk premiums while there was a relatively lower level of investor demand for certain ABS (particularly those securities backed by nonprime collateral). The demand for lower credit grade ABS could become limited or illiquid, as it did during the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn, restricting our ability to access the ABS market for nonprime collateralized receivables. In addition, the risk of volatility surrounding the global economic system and uncertainty surrounding regulatory reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act continue to create uncertainty around access to the capital markets. Regulatory reforms may also require us to retain a minimum specified portion (5%) of the credit risk on assets collateralizing ABS issuances, reducing the amount of liquidity otherwise generally available through ABS programs. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in selling securities in the ABS market. Adverse changes in our ABS program or in the ABS market generally could materially adversely affect our ability to securitize loans on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to us. This could increase our cost of funding, reduce our margins, or cause us to hold assets until investor demand improves.\nWe also depend on various credit facilities and flow agreements to fund our future liquidity needs. We cannot guarantee that these financing sources will continue to be available beyond the current maturity dates, on reasonable terms, or at all. As our volume of loan acquisitions and originations increases, especially due to our relationship with FCA, we will require the expanded borrowing capacity on existing or additional credit facilities and flow agreements. The availability of these financing sources depends, in part, on factors outside of our control, including regulatory capital treatment for unfunded bank lines of credit, the financial strength and strategic objectives of Santander and the other banks that participate in our credit facilities and flow agreements, and the availability of bank liquidity in general. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breach of financial covenants such as timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC, which could reduce our access to bank funding. In the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments, or the liquidation of certain assets.\nAlthough we have seen a gradual increase in our cost of funding recently, we have not experienced a significant increase in risk premiums. However, we are not isolated from general market conditions that may affect issuers of ABS and other borrowers and we could experience increased risk premiums or funding costs in the future. In addition, if the sources of funding described above are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason, we may have to curtail or suspend our loan acquisition and origination activities. Downsizing the scale of our business would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nWe face significant risks in implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside our control.\nWe intend to continue our growth strategy to expand our vehicle finance franchise by increasing market penetration via the number and depth of our relationships in the vehicle finance market, pursuing additional relationships with OEMs, expanding our direct-to-consumer footprint and growing our serviced for others platform. Our ability to execute this growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the inherent uncertainty regarding general economic conditions;\n\u2022our ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans;\n\u2022\nthe prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate, and, federal laws and regulations, to the extent applicable, which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022the degree of competition in our markets and its effect on our ability to attract customers;\n\u2022our ability to recruit qualified personnel, in particular, in areas where we face a great deal of competition; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals, government permits, or licenses that may be required on a timely basis.\nOur agreement with FCA may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement.\nIn February 2013, we entered into a ten-year Master Private Label Financing Agreement (the Chrysler Agreement) with FCA whereby we launched the Chrysler Capital brand, which originates private-label loans and leases to facilitate the purchase of FCA vehicles by consumers and FCA-franchised automotive dealers. The financing services that we provide under the Chrysler Agreement, which launched May 1, 2013, include credit lines to finance FCA-franchised dealers\u2019 acquisitions of vehicles and other products that FCA sells or distributes, automotive loans and leases to finance consumer acquisitions of new and used vehicles at FCA-franchised dealerships, financing for commercial and fleet customers, and ancillary services. In addition, we may facilitate, for an affiliate, offerings to dealers for dealer loan financing, construction loans, real estate loans, working capital loans, and revolving lines of credit. In accordance with the terms of the Chrysler Agreement, in May 2013 we paid FCA a $150 million upfront, nonrefundable payment, which will be amortized over ten years but would be recognized as expense immediately if the Chrysler Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\nAs part of the Chrysler Agreement, we received limited exclusivity rights to participate in specified minimum percentages of certain of FCA's financing incentive programs, which include loan rate subvention and automotive lease residual support subvention. We have committed to certain revenue sharing arrangements. We bear the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the Chrysler Agreement, but FCA will share in any residual gains and losses in respect of automotive leases, subject to specific provisions in the Chrysler Agreement, including limitations on our participation in gains and losses. In addition, under the Chrysler Agreement, FCA has the option to acquire, for fair market value, an equity participation in an operating entity through which the financial services contemplated by the Chrysler Agreement are offered and provided, through either an equity interest in the new entity or participation in a joint venture or other similar business relationship or structure. There is no maximum limit on the size of FCA\u2019s potential equity participation. Although the Chrysler Agreement contains provisions that are designed to address a situation in which the parties disagree on the fair market value of the equity participation interest, there is a risk that we ultimately receive less than what we believe to be the fair market value for such interest.\nThe Chrysler Agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including the failure by either party to comply with certain of their ongoing obligations under the Chrysler Agreement. These obligations include SC's meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years of the agreement. We have not met these penetration rates in the past and may not meet these penetration rates in the future. If we continue not to meet these specified penetration rates, FCA may elect to terminate the Chrysler Agreement. FCA may also terminate the agreement if, among other circumstances, (i) a person other than Santander and its affiliates or our other stockholders owns 20% or more of our common stock and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person, (ii) we become, control, or become controlled by, an OEM that competes with FCA or (iii) if certain of our credit facilities become impaired.\nThe loans and leases originated through Chrysler Capital are expected to provide us with a significant portion of our projected growth over the next several years. Our ability to realize the full strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with FCA depends in part on the successful development of our Chrysler Capital business, which will require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and effort. If we are unable to realize the expected benefits of our relationship with FCA, or if the Chrysler Agreement were to terminate, our ability to generate or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures.\nWe regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer be aligned with our strategic objectives. For example, in October 2015, we disclosed a decision to exit our personal lending business and to explore strategic alternatives for our existing personal lending assets. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We may also experience greater costs and dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue may be larger than projected. Additionally, we may ultimately dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than those we had originally anticipated. After reaching a definitive agreement with a buyer, we typically must satisfy pre-closing conditions and the completion of the transaction may be subject to regulatory and governmental approvals; if these conditions and approvals are not satisfied or obtained, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur two primary personal lending relationships have been with LendingClub and Bluestem. We completed the sale of substantially all of our LendingClub loans in February 2016. We continue to hold our Bluestem portfolio, which had a balance of approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2015, and we remain a party to agreements with Bluestem that obligate us to purchase new advances originated by Bluestem, along with existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in April 2020 and, based on an amendment in June 2014, renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem's option. Although we are seeking a third party willing and able to take on this obligation, we may not be successful in finding such a party, and Bluestem may not agree to the substitution. We continue to classify the Bluestem portfolio as held-for-sale. We have recorded significant lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on this portfolio and may continue to do so as long as we hold the portfolio, particularly due to the new volume we are committed to purchase.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships.\nOur ability to acquire loans and automotive leases is reliant on our relationships with automotive dealers. In particular, our automotive finance operations depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with reputable automotive dealers that direct customers to our offices or originate loans at the point-of-sale, which we subsequently purchase. Although we have relationships with certain automotive dealers, none of our relationships are exclusive and any may be terminated at any time. As a result of the economic downturn and contraction of credit to both dealers and their customers, there was an increase in dealership closures and our existing dealer base experienced decreased sales and loan volume in the past and may experience decreased sales and loan volume in the future, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining our serviced for others portfolio.\nA significant and growing portion of our business strategy is to increase the revenue stream from our serviced for others portfolio by continuing to add assets to this portfolio. If an institution for which we currently service assets chooses to terminate our rights as servicer, or if we fail to add additional institutions or portfolios to our servicing platform, we may not achieve the desired revenue or income from this platform.\nA reduction in demand for our products and failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe demand for the products we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences or financial conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products. Should we fail to adapt to significant changes in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products, our revenues could decrease significantly and our operations could be harmed. Even if we do make changes to our product offerings to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist such changes or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and, by that time, it may be too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial condition, liquidity and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, more than 88% of our vehicle consumer loans and more than 48% of our personal loans are nonprime receivables with obligors who do not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. While underwriting guidelines were designed to establish that, notwithstanding such factors, the obligor would be a reasonable credit risk, the receivables nonetheless will experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime obligors. In the event of such a default on an auto loan, generally the most practical alternative is repossession of the financed vehicle, although the collateral value of the vehicle usually does not cover the outstanding account balance and costs of recovery. Repossessions and foreclosure sales that do not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full could result in losses on those receivables. We repossessed 252,281 vehicles, incurring $2.0 billion in net losses, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, of which 238,136 repossessions and $1.8 billion of net losses were on nonprime receivables. We experienced a default rate of 8.3% for nonprime receivables and 2.9% for prime receivables during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, our prime portfolio has grown in proportion to our overall portfolio over the past several years. While prime portfolios typically have lower default rates than nonprime portfolios, we have less ability to make risk adjustments to the pricing of prime loans compared to nonprime loans. As a result, a larger proportion of our business will consist of loans with respect to which we have less flexibility to adjust pricing to absorb losses. As a result of these factors, we may sustain higher losses than anticipated in our prime portfolio.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about borrowers and counterparties and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn deciding whether to approve loans or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties in our retail lending and commercial lending businesses, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Our controls and processes may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in our loan originations or from our business clients. Any such misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and other personnel, could negatively impact our business.\nThe successful implementation of our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and on our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel as well as have an effective succession planning framework in place. The loss of any key member of our management team or other key employees could hinder or delay our ability to implement our growth strategy effectively. Further, if we are unable to attract appropriately qualified personnel as we expand, we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy. In either instance, our profitability and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nDue to our relationship with Santander, we also are subject to indirect regulation by the European Central Bank, which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EU (also known as CRD IV). These restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in our relationship with Santander may adversely affect our operations.\nSantander, through SHUSA, owns 210,995,049 shares (approximately 58.9%) of our common stock and has delivered, as of July 3, 2015, an irrevocable notice to exercise the call option with respect to all 34,598,506 shares (approximately 9.7%) of our common stock owned by DDFS LLC, the consummation of which is subject to required bank regulatory approvals and any other approvals required by law being obtained. We rely on our relationship with Santander, through SHUSA, for several competitive advantages including relationships with OEMs and regulatory best practices. Santander also provides us with significant funding support, through both committed liquidity and opportunistic extensions of credit.\nDuring the financial downturn, Santander and its affiliates provided us with more than $6 billion in financing that enabled us to pursue several acquisitions and/or conversions of vehicle loan portfolios at a time when most major banks were curtailing or eliminating their commercial lending activities. If Santander or SHUSA elects not to provide such support or not to provide it to the same degree, we may not be able to replace such support ourselves or to obtain substitute arrangements with third parties. We may be unable to obtain such support because of financial or other constraints, or be unable to implement substitute arrangements on a timely basis on terms that are comparable, or at all, which could adversely affect our operations.\nFurthermore, Santander is permitted to sell its interest in us. If Santander reduces its equity interest in us, it may be less willing to provide us with the support it has provided in the past. In addition, our right to use the Santander name is on the basis of a non-exclusive, royalty-free, and non-transferable license from Santander, and further only extends to uses in connection with our current and future operations within the United States. Santander may terminate such license at any time Santander ceases to own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of our common stock. If we were required to change our name, we would incur the administrative costs and time associated with revising legal documents and marketing materials, and also may experience loss of brand and loss of business or loss of funding due to consumers\u2019 and banks\u2019 relative lack of familiarity with our new name. Additionally, FCA may terminate the Chrysler Agreement if a person other than Santander and its affiliates or our other stockholders owns 20% or more of our common stock, and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person.\nSantander has provided guarantees on the covenants, agreements, and our obligations under the governing documents of our warehouse facilities and privately issued amortizing notes. These guarantees are limited to our obligations as servicer. We have agreed to pay Santander a fee of 12.5 basis points on certain debt facilities in exchange for providing such guarantees, and this fee will increase our cost of funding. SHUSA may provide similar guarantees in the future, and we have agreed to pay SHUSA the same as Santander for any such guarantees that may be provided.\nSome terms of our credit agreements are influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings of Santander. If Santander were to suffer credit rating downgrades or other adverse financial developments, we could be negatively impacted, either directly or indirectly. Santander\u2019s short-term credit ratings downgrades in 2012, from A-1 to A-2 (Standard & Poor\u2019s) and from P-1 to P-2 (Moody\u2019s), did not directly impact our cost of funds. However, due to the contractual terms of certain of our debt agreements, these downgrades resulted in the loss of our ability to commingle funds on most facilities. The loss of commingling increased the amount of funds we were required to borrow, thereby indirectly raising our cost of funds by approximately $1 million per month. In addition, because of the methodologies applied by credit rating agencies, our securitization ratings in our ABS offerings are indirectly tied to Santander\u2019s credit ratings.\nSantander applies certain standardized banking policies, procedures, and standards across its affiliated entities, including with respect to internal audit, credit approval, governance, risk management, and compensation practices. We currently follow certain of these Santander policies and may in the future become subject to additional Santander policies, procedures, and standards, which could result in changes to our practices.\nIt is also possible that our continuing relationship with Santander or SHUSA could reduce the willingness of other banks to develop relationships with us due to general competitive dynamics among such banks.\nNegative changes in the business of the OEMs with which we have strategic relationships, including Chrysler, could adversely affect our business.\nA significant adverse change in FCA\u2019s or other automotive manufacturers\u2019 business, including (i) significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets, (ii) the production or sale of FCA or other automotive manufacturers\u2019 vehicles (including the effects of any product recalls), (iii) the quality or resale value of FCA or other vehicles, (iv) the use of marketing incentives, (v) FCA\u2019s or other automotive manufacturers\u2019 relationships with their key suppliers, or (vi) FCA\u2019s or other automotive manufacturers\u2019 respective relationships with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions, and other factors impacting automotive manufacturers or their employees could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nUnder the Chrysler Agreement, we originate private-label loans and leases to facilitate the purchase of FCA vehicles by consumers and FCA-franchised automotive dealers. In the future, it is possible that FCA or other automotive manufacturers with whom we have relationships could utilize other companies to support their financing needs, including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, FCA or other automotive manufacturers could expand, establish, or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.\nThere can be no assurance that the global automotive market, or Chrysler\u2019s or our other OEM partners\u2019 share of that market, will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur information technology may not support our future volumes and business strategies.\nWe rely on our proprietary origination and servicing platforms that utilize database-driven software applications, including nearly 20 years of internal historical credit data and extensive third-party data, to continuously adapt our origination and servicing operations to evolving consumer behavior, changing vehicle finance and consumer loan products, and third party purchaser requirements. We employ an extensive team of engineers, information technology analysts, and website designers to ensure that our information technology systems remain competitive. However, due to the continued rapid changes in technology, there can be no assurance that our information technology solutions will continue to be adequate for the business or to provide a competitive advantage.\nOur network and information systems are important to our operating activities and any network and information system shutdowns could disrupt our ability to process loan applications, originate loans, or service our existing loan portfolios, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating activities. Shutdowns may be caused by unforeseen catastrophic events, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, large-scale power outages, software or hardware defects, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, difficulties in migrating technology facilities from one location to another, or other similar events. Although we maintain, and regularly assess the adequacy of, a disaster recovery plan designed to effectively manage the effects of such unforeseen events, we cannot be certain that such plan will function as intended, or otherwise resolve or compensate for such effects. Such a failure of our disaster recovery plan, if and when experienced, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and ability to support and service our customer base.\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements, and our estimates and assumptions may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. Critical estimates are made by management in determining, among other things, the allowance for credit losses, amounts of impairment, and valuation of income taxes. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur allowance for credit losses and impairments may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, that we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in our originated loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may undergo material changes.\nFor receivables portfolios purchased from other lenders at a discount to the aggregate principal balance of the receivables, the portion of the discount that was attributable to credit deterioration since origination of the loans is recorded as a nonaccretable difference. Any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in an incremental allowance. Our credit loss allowance as of December 31, 2015, is $3.3 billion, or 12.3% of outstanding principal balances. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses and nonaccretable difference inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to change. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding our loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the provision for credit losses. In addition, if net charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we will need to make additional provisions to increase the allowance. There is no precisely accurate method for predicting credit losses, and we cannot provide assurance that our current or future credit loss allowance will be sufficient to cover actual losses.\nThe process for determining our allowance for credit losses is complex, and we may from time to time make changes to our process for determining our allowance for credit losses. In addition, regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the\nprovision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Changes that we make to enhance our process for determining our allowance for credit losses may lead to an increase in our allowance for credit losses. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the value of used cars declines, resulting in lower residual values of our vehicle leases and lower recoveries in sales of repossessed vehicles.\nGeneral economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other used vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices and marketing programs, vehicle brand image and strength, perceived vehicle quality, general consumer preference and confidence levels, seasonality, overall price and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the residual value of our leased vehicles and the amount we recover in remarketing repossessed vehicles. We expect our financial results to be more sensitive to used auto prices as leases continue to become a larger part of our business.\nOur expectation of the residual value of a leased vehicle is a critical input in determining the amount of the lease payments at the inception of a lease contract. Our lease customers are responsible only for any deviation from expected residual value that is caused by excess mileage or excess wear and tear, while we retain the obligation to absorb any general market changes in the value of the vehicle. Therefore, our operating lease expense is increased when we have to take an impairment on our residual values or when the realized residual value of a vehicle at lease termination is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception. In addition, the timeliness, effectiveness, and quality of our remarketing of off-lease vehicles affects the net proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While we have elected not to purchase residual value insurance, our exposure is somewhat lessened by FCA\u2019s residual subvention programs and the sharing of losses over a specified threshold. However, we take the first portion of loss on any vehicle, and such losses could have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.\nLower used vehicle prices also reduce the amount we can recover when remarketing repossessed vehicles that serve as collateral on the underlying loans. As a result, declines in used vehicle prices could have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.\nPoor portfolio performance may trigger credit enhancement provisions in our revolving credit facilities or secured structured financings.\nOur revolving credit facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits on the receivables pledged to each facility that, if exceeded, would increase the level of credit enhancement requirements for that facility and redirect all excess cash to the credit providers. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective credit line; however, for certain of our warehouse facilities, delinquency, and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to our serviced portfolio as a whole. Our facilities used to finance vehicle lease originations also have a residual loss ratio limit calculated with respect to our serviced lease portfolio as a whole.\nThe documents that govern our secured structured financings also contain cumulative net loss ratio limits on the receivables included in each securitization trust. If, at any measurement date, a cumulative net loss trigger with respect to any financing were to exceed the specified limits, provisions of the financing agreements would increase the level of credit enhancement requirements for that financing and redirect all excess cash to the holders of the ABS. During this period, excess cash flows, if any, from the facility would be used to fund the increased credit enhancement levels rather than being distributed to us. Once an impacted trust reaches the new requirement, we would return to receiving a residual distribution from the trust.\nFuture significant loan, lease, or personal loan repurchase requirements could harm our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to the loans sold, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If significant repurchases of assets or other payments are required under our responsibility as servicer, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. As we have increased the\nnumber of loans sold, the potential impact of such repurchases has increased.\nWe have treated sales of the debt and equity in certain of our securitizations as sales of the underlying finance receivables. The exercise of our clean-up call option on each of these securitizations when the collateral pool balance reaches 10% of its original balance would result in the repurchase of the remaining underlying finance receivables, exposing us to credit performance risk for the remainder of the pool's life.\nWe apply financial leverage to our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently apply financial leverage, pledging most of our assets to credit facilities and securitization trusts, and we intend to continue to apply financial leverage in our retail lending operations. Our debt-to-assets ratio is 83.1% as of December 31, 2015. Although our total borrowings are restricted by covenants in our credit facilities and market conditions, our Board may change our target borrowing levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders. Incurring substantial debt subjects us to the risk that our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to service our outstanding debt.\nOur indebtedness and other obligations are significant and impose restrictions on our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $30.4 billion and $27.8 billion, respectively, in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $29.0 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively, in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 11.3% of our total net finance and other interest income, net of leased vehicle expense, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.\nOur debt reduces operational flexibility and creates default risks. Our revolving credit facilities contain a borrowing base or advance rate formula that requires us to pledge finance contracts in excess of the amounts that we can borrow under the facilities. We are also required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under the credit facilities. In addition, certain facilities require the replacement of delinquent or defaulted collateral, and the finance contracts pledged as collateral in securitizations must be less than 31 days delinquent at the time the securitization is issued. Accordingly, increases in delinquencies or defaults resulting from weakened economic conditions would require us to pledge additional finance contracts to support the same borrowing levels and may cause us to be unable to securitize loans to the extent we desire. These outcomes would adversely impact our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the credit facilities generally contain various covenants requiring, in certain cases, minimum financial ratios, asset quality, and portfolio performance ratios (portfolio net loss and delinquency ratios, and pool level cumulative net loss ratios), as well as limits on deferral levels. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for certain of our third-party credit facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to our serviced portfolio as a whole. Covenants on our debts also limit our ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 purchase large loan portfolios in bulk;\n\u2022 sell assets, including our loan portfolio or the capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 create or incur liens; and\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nAdditionally, certain of our credit facilities contain minimum tangible net worth requirements, and certain of our credit facilities contain covenants require timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC.\nFailure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under these agreements and/or remove us as servicer.\nWe currently have the ability to pledge retained residuals and create additional unsecured indebtedness on our credit facilities provided by Santander. As we execute on our strategy to reduce our reliance on borrowings under commitments from Santander, we must find other funding sources. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nIn addition, certain of our funding arrangements may require us to make payments to third parties if losses exceed certain thresholds, including, for example, our flow agreements with Bank of America, CBP and another third party, and arrangements with certain third-party loan originators of loans that we purchase on a periodic basis.\nCompetition with other lenders could adversely affect us.\nThe vehicle finance market is served by a variety of entities, including the captive finance affiliates of major automotive manufacturers, banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and independent finance companies. The market is highly fragmented, with no individual lender capturing more than 10% of the market. Our competitors often provide financing on terms more favorable to automobile purchasers or dealers than we offer. Many of these competitors also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealerships and may offer dealerships or their customers other forms of financing that we do not offer.\nWe anticipate that we will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations and as the economy continues to emerge from recession. In addition, certain of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory regimes that we are. As a result, these competitors may have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services, and may be more aggressive in their loan origination activities. Increasing competition could also require us to lower the rates we charge on loans in order to maintain loan origination volume, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, including our profitability.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely impact our profitability and risk profile.\nOur profitability may be directly affected by interest rate levels and fluctuations in interest rates. As interest rates change, our gross interest rate spread on originations either increases or decreases because the rates charged on the contracts originated or purchased from dealers are limited by market and competitive conditions, restricting our ability to pass on increased interest costs to the consumer. Additionally, although the majority of our borrowers are nonprime and are not highly sensitive to interest rate movement, increases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate. While we monitor the interest rate environment and employ hedging strategies designed to mitigate the impact of increased interest rates, we cannot provide assurance that hedging strategies will fully mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates.\nWe are subject to market, operational, and other related risks associated with our derivative transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe enter into derivative transactions for economic hedging purposes. We are subject to market and operational risks associated with these transactions, including basis risk, the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, credit or default risk, the risk of insolvency, or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder, including providing sufficient collateral. Additionally, certain of our derivative agreements require us to post collateral when the fair value of the derivative is negative. Our ability to adequately monitor, analyze, and report derivative transactions continues to depend, to a great extent, on our information technology systems. This fact further increases the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAdverse outcomes to current and future litigation against us may negatively impact our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties. Some litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints by consumers. As the assignee of loans originated by automotive dealers, we also may be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against automotive dealers.\nAdditionally, we are party to a purported securities class action lawsuit seeking to represent a class consisting of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities pursuant and/or traceable to our Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with our IPO, and a class consisting of all those who purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between January 23, 2014 and June 12, 2014. The amended class action complaint alleges that our Registration Statement and Prospectus and certain subsequent public disclosures contained misleading statements concerning the Company\u2019s compliance systems and ability to pay dividends. The amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12(a) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks damages and other relief. On December 18, 2015, we moved to dismiss the amended class action complaint.\nWe are also party to a shareholder derivative complaint pending in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The lawsuit names as defendants current and former members of the Board, and names the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the current and former director defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with overseeing the Company's subprime auto lending practices, resulting in harm to the Company. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and equitable relief. On December 29, 2015, the derivative action was stayed, pending the resolution of the securities class action.\nWe evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates, and any adverse resolution of litigation pending or threatened against us could negatively impact our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nA security breach or a cyber-attack could adversely affect our business.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential consumer information and may, subject to applicable law, share that information with our third-party service providers. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. A security breach or cyber-attack of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. If third parties or our employees are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers\u2019 personal information or contract information, or if we give third parties or our employees improper access to consumers\u2019 personal information or contract information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include investigations, fines, or penalties imposed by state or federal regulatory agencies, including the loss of necessary permits or licenses. This liability could also include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims, claims for other misuses, or losses of personal information, including for unauthorized marketing purposes or claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure online transmission of confidential consumer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect sensitive consumer transaction data. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or cyber-attacks, or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or attacks.\nWe have seen in recent years computer systems of companies and organizations being targeted, not only by cyber criminals, but also by activists and rogue states. We have been and continue to be subject to a range of cyber-attacks, such as denial of service, malware and phishing. Cyber-attacks could give rise to the loss of significant amounts of customer data and other sensitive information, as well as significant levels of liquid assets (including cash). In addition, cyber-attacks could give rise to the disablement of our information technology systems used to service our customers. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may incur significant costs in our attempt to modify or enhance our protective measures against such attacks, or to investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach, or in communicating cyber-attacks to our customers. If we fail to effectively manage our cyber-security risk by failing to update our systems and processes in response to new threats, this could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects through the payment of customer compensation, regulatory penalties and fines and/or through the loss of assets.\nWe manage and hold confidential personal information of customers in the conduct of our operations. Although we have procedures and controls to safeguard personal information in our possession, unauthorized disclosures could subject us to legal actions and administrative sanctions, as well as damages that could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, our business is exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct or negligence and fraud, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. In addition, we may be required to report events related to information security issues (including any cyber-security issues), events where customer information may be compromised, unauthorized access and other security breaches, to the relevant regulatory authorities. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer requests, to be lost or to be delivered to our clients with delays or errors, which could reduce demand for our services and products, and could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe partially rely on third parties to deliver services, and failure by those parties to provide these services or meet contractual requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business operations. For example, we depend on third parties like Experian to obtain data related to our market that we use in our origination and servicing platforms. In addition, we rely on third-party servicing centers for a portion of our servicing activities and on third-party repossession agents. If a service\nprovider fails to provide the services that we require or expect, or fails to meet contractual requirements, such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to process customers\u2019 transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering our ability to service our customers, or subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk for poor vendor oversight. Such a failure could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services, and the quality of our brands, and could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses.\nWe have made business acquisitions for which it is possible that the goodwill and intangible assets which have been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business\u2019 underlying profitability, asset quality or other relevant matters. Impairment testing with respect to goodwill and intangible assets is performed annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. Our stock price and various other factors affect the assessment of the fair value of our underlying business for purposes of performing any goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment. There were no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013. However, our stock price has declined significantly since December 31, 2015, and we may be required to record impairment of our $74 million in goodwill, as well as our $38 million in intangible assets not subject to amortization, in periods subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nCatastrophic events may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks, and the escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects, such as imposition of increased security measures, changes in applicable laws, market disruptions, and job losses. These events may have an adverse effect on the economy in general. Moreover, the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to these threats could affect our business in ways that cannot be predicted. The effect of any of these events or threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to satisfy obligations associated with being a public company may have adverse regulatory, economic, and reputational consequences.\nAs a public company, we are required to prepare and distribute periodic reports containing our consolidated financial statements with the SEC, prepare and distribute other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable stock exchange rules; evaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; involve and retain outside legal counsel and accountants in connection with the activities listed above; maintain an investor relations function; and maintain internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures.\nOn February 29, 2016, we filed an extension request under Rule 12b-25 with the SEC, resulting in the extension of the deadline for filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K from 60 days after the fiscal year-end (February 29, 2016) to 75 days after the fiscal-year end (March 15, 2016). We did not file this Form 10-K by the extended filing deadline. Among other consequences, our failure to file our Form 10-K by the extended filing deadline will result in the suspension of our eligibility to use Form S-3 registration statements until we have timely filed our SEC periodic reports for a period of twelve months, which may increase the time and resources we need to expend if we choose to access the public capital markets.\nInternal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that we timely report information as specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC. We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting. However, these controls may not achieve, and in some cases have not achieved, their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected, and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If our controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and market for our common stock, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, including interim periods, we have identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses are described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain of these material weaknesses involve the failure of controls to operate effectively, resulting in misstatements in our publicly filed financial statements as of for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and interim periods in 2015 and 2014. The errors and resulting corrections to annual financial statements are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, with corrections to interim periods shown in Item 9B.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and continually changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business.\nDue to the highly regulated nature of the consumer finance industry, we are required to comply with a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our origination and servicing operations. These regulations directly impact our business and require constant compliance, monitoring, and internal and external audits. Although we have an extensive enterprise-wide compliance framework structured to continuously monitor our activities, compliance with applicable law is costly, and may create operational constraints.\nThese laws and their implementing regulations include, among others, usury laws, Anti-Money Laundering requirements (Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act), ECOA, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Privacy Regulations (Gramm-Leach Bliley Act and Right to Financial Privacy Act), Electronic Funds Transfer Act, SCRA, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Truth in Lending Act, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, and requirements related to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.\nMany states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, those listed above. These federal, state, and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when making loans or conducting other types of financial transactions.\nNew legislation and regulation may include changes with respect to consumer financial protection measures and systematic risk oversight authority. Such changes present the risk of financial loss due to regulatory fines or penalties, restrictions or suspensions of business, or costs associated with mandatory corrective action as a result of failure to adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general, civil or criminal liability, or damage to our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOther regulatory reforms adopted or proposed in the wake of the financial crisis have increased and may continue to materially increase our operating costs and negatively impact our business model. In addition, the volume, granularity, frequency and scale of regulatory and other reporting requirements necessitate a clear data strategy to enable consistent data aggregation, reporting and management. Inadequate management information systems or processes, including those relating to risk data aggregation and risk reporting, could lead to a failure to meet regulatory reporting requirements, or other internal or external information demands, and we may face supervisory measures as a result.\nWe are subject to certain banking regulations that limit our business activities, including our ability to pay dividends and enter into certain business transactions without the approval of the Federal Reserve.\nBecause our controlling shareholder, SHUSA, is a bank holding company and because we provide third party services to banks, we are directly and indirectly subject to certain banking regulations, including oversight by the Federal Reserve, the ECB, and the OCC. We also are subject to oversight by the CFPB. Such banking regulations could limit the activities and the types of businesses that we may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve could exercise its power to restrict SHUSA from having a non-bank subsidiary that is engaged in any activity that, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound business practice, and could exercise its power to restrict us from engaging in any such activity. This power includes the authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s opinion, such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Moreover, certain banks and bank holding companies, including SHUSA, are required to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis, and to receive a notice of non-objection to the plan from the Federal Reserve before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments.\nDue to the Federal Reserve's objections, based on qualitative concerns, in March 2014 and March 2015 to SHUSA's capital plan submissions, we currently are prohibited from paying dividends until either the Federal Reserve issues a non-objection to SHUSA's next capital plan submission or a non-objection to a planned dividend payment. Also, on September 15, 2014, SHUSA entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve memorializing prior discussions under which, among other things, SHUSA is prohibited from allowing its non-wholly-owned nonbank subsidiaries, including us, to declare or pay any dividend, or to make any capital distribution, without the prior written approval of Federal Reserve. In April 2016, SHUSA intends to submit a revised capital plan, but there can be no assurance whether or when the Federal Reserve will accept SHUSA\u2019s capital plan, or whether the Federal Reserve will give its written approval for any future dividends or capital distributions.\nSHUSA and the Company also are subject to increasingly stringent oversight by the Federal Reserve due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s objection to SHUSA\u2019s capital plan submissions and, in response, SHUSA has made a concentrated effort to improve its governance, oversight and internal controls, policies, procedures and functions, including as they relate to us. We expect to incur higher costs than originally anticipated in connection with ensuring compliance with, and assisting SHUSA in, the CCAR process.\nThe Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations that we may commit, and has the authority to approve or disallow acquisitions or other activities we may contemplate, which may limit our future growth plans. To the extent that we are subject to banking regulation, we could be at a competitive disadvantage because some of our competitors are not subject to these limitations.\nThe suspension of our ability to pay dividends or other limitations placed on us by the Federal Reserve, the ECB, or any other regulator and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are or may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.\nFrom time to time, we are or may become involved in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies, including, among others, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the DOJ, the SEC, the FTC and various state regulatory agencies. Currently, such proceedings include a civil subpoena from the DOJ, under FIRREA, requesting the production of documents and communications that, among other things, relate to the underwriting and securitization of nonprime auto loans since 2007. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Company received a preservation letter and request for documents from the SEC requesting the preservation and production of documents and communications that, among other things, relate to the underwriting and securitization of auto loans since January 1, 2011. The Company also has received civil subpoenas from various state Attorneys General requesting similar documents and communications.\nOn November 4, 2015, the Company entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance (AOD) with the Office of Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the Massachusetts AG). The Massachusetts AG had alleged that the Company violated the maximum permissible interest rates allowed by Massachusetts law due to the inclusion of guaranteed auto protection (GAP) charges in the calculation of finance charges. Among other things, the AOD requires the Company, with respect to any loan that exceeded the maximum rates, to issue refunds of all finance charges paid to date and to waive all future finance charges. The AOD also requires the Company to undertake certain remedial measures, including ensuring that interest rates on its loans do not exceed maximum rates (when GAP charges are included) in the future, and provides that the Company pay $150,000 to the Massachusetts AG to reimburse its costs in implementing the AOD.\nOn February 25, 2015, the Company entered into a consent order with the DOJ, approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, that resolves the DOJ\u2019s claims against the Company that certain of its repossession and collection activities during the period of time between January 2008 and February 2013 violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The consent order requires SC to pay a civil fine in the amount of $55,000, as well as at least $9.4 million to affected servicemembers, consisting of $10,000 per servicemember plus compensation for any lost equity (with interest) for each repossession by SC and $5,000 per servicemember for each instance where SC sought to collect repossession-related fees on accounts where a repossession was conducted by a prior account holder. The order also requires the Company to undertake additional remedial measures.\nOn July 31, 2015, the CFPB notified the Company that it had referred to the DOJ certain alleged violations by the Company of the ECOA regarding (i) statistical disparities in markups charged by automobile dealers to protected groups on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by the Company and (ii) the treatment of certain types of income in the Company's\nunderwriting process. On September 25, 2015, the DOJ notified the Company that it has initiated, based on the referral from the CFPB, an investigation under the ECOA of the Company's pricing of automobile loans.\nEach of the matters set forth above may result in material adverse consequences to us including, without limitation, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.\nWe are subject to capital planning and systemic risk regimes as a subsidiary of SHUSA, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.\nAs a bank holding company with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, SHUSA is required to conduct periodic stress tests which are evaluated by the Federal Reserve. As a subsidiary of SHUSA, the predicted performance of the Company under the stress test conditions must be taken into account when SHUSA conducts these periodic stress tests. SHUSA is also required to submit a proposed capital action plan to the Federal Reserve annually that includes a description of all planned capital actions, including all planned capital actions by the Company, over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could have an impact on SHUSA\u2019s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how SHUSA would maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common equity-to-total-risk-weighted assets ratio of 5 percent, and serve as a source of strength to SBNA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHUSA. The Federal Reserve will either object to a proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection. A failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve prohibits us from paying dividends and making other capital distributions. As noted above, the Federal Reserve objected to SHUSA\u2019s proposed capital plans in March 2014 and March 2015, and we currently are prohibited from paying dividends and making other capital distributions until either the Federal Reserve issues a non-objection to SHUSA's next capital plan submission or a non-objection to a planned dividend payment.\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies such as SHUSA. The final rule generally became effective on January 1, 2015. Among other things, the final rule requires SHUSA to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures and imposes certain requirements, duties and qualifications for the risk committee and chief risk officers of SHUSA. SHUSA calculates its liquidity figures on a consolidated basis with certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company. As a result, the predicted performance of the Company under the liquidity stress event must be taken into account when SHUSA conducts its 30-day liquidity stress event analysis. Due to these requirements, we will be required to have an increased amount of liquidity and will incur increased costs of funding and liquidity capacity.\nThese enhanced prudential standards could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rules.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the U.S. Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions. The U.S. Basel III final rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. SHUSA became subject to the U.S. Basel III final rules beginning January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III final rules subject SHUSA to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. SHUSA calculates its capital figures on a consolidated basis with certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nIf SHUSA were to fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, SHUSA, together with its subsidiaries, including the Company, may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the Federal Reserve. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. To maintain its status as a FHC, SHUSA and its bank subsidiary and our affiliate, SBNA, must remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell-managed,\u201d as defined under applicable law.\nFor the current capital planning and stress testing cycle that began in January 2016, the Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests and supervisory stress tests to which SHUSA is subject, the annual capital plan that SHUSA must submit and the Federal\nReserve\u2019s annual post-stress capital analysis under the CCAR must incorporate the more stringent capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules as they are phased in over the nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon. We are prohibited from paying dividends and making other capital distributions until either the Federal Reserve issues a non-objection to SHUSA's next capital plan submission or a non-objection to a planned dividend payment.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the CFPB, in addition to recently issued rules and guidance, will likely increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act introduced a substantial number of reforms that continue to reshape the structure of the regulation of the financial services industry. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act includes, among other things, the creation of the CFPB, which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products and services.\nIn March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, a class that includes us, take steps to monitor and impose controls over dealer markup policies where dealers charge consumers higher interest rates, with the markup shared between the dealer and the lender. The CFPB is also conducting supervisory audits of large vehicle lenders and has indicated it intends to study and take action with respect to possible ECOA \u201cdisparate impact\u201d credit discrimination in indirect vehicle finance. In December 2013, the CFPB and the DOJ entered into a consent order with a large auto finance company pertaining to an allegation of disparate impact regarding auto dealer markups on purchased installment contracts. If the CFPB continues to enter into consent decrees with lenders on disparate impact claims, it could negatively impact the business of the affected lenders, and potentially the business of dealers and other lenders in the vehicle finance market. This impact on dealers and lenders could increase our regulatory compliance requirements and associated costs. Unlike competitors that are banks, we are subject to the licensing and operational requirements of states and other jurisdictions, and our business would be adversely affected if we lost our licenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also included risk retention requirements. In October 2014, six federal agencies approved a final rule implementing these requirements. The rule generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Compliance with the risk retention rules is required with respect to offerings of ABS (other than ABS collateralized by residential mortgages) beginning December 24, 2016. Certain of our securitization structures may be adversely impacted by the risk retention requirement.\nUnlike competitors that are banks, we are subject to the licensing and operational requirements of states and other jurisdictions, and our business would be adversely affected if we lost our licenses.\nBecause we are not a depository institution, we do not benefit from exemptions to state loan servicing or debt collection licensing and regulatory requirements. To the extent that they exist, we must comply with state licensing and various operational compliance requirements in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. These include, among others, form and content of contracts, other documentation, collection practices and disclosures, and record keeping requirements. We are sensitive to regulatory changes that may increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws, or increased fees. Currently, we have all required licenses, as applicable, to do business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nIn addition, we are subject to periodic examinations by state and other regulators. The states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our business may later choose to do so. The failure to comply with licensing or permit requirements and other local regulatory requirements could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, possible review of licenses, and damage to reputation, brand, and valued customer relationships.\nWe are subject to potential intervention by any of our regulators or supervisors, particularly in response to customer complaints.\nAs noted above, our business and operations are subject to increasingly significant rules and regulations that are required to conduct banking and financial services business. These apply to business operations, affect financial returns, include reserve and reporting requirements, and prudential and conduct of business regulations. These requirements are set by the relevant central banks and regulatory authorities that authorize, regulate and supervise us in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIn their supervisory roles, the regulators seek to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions, with the aim of strengthening, but not guaranteeing, the protection of customers and the financial system. The supervisors continuing supervision of financial institutions is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of prudential returns, reports obtained from skilled persons, visits to firms and regular meetings with management to discuss issues such as performance, risk management and strategy. In general, these regulators have a more outcome-focused regulatory approach that involves more proactive enforcement and more punitive penalties for infringement. As a result, we\nface increased supervisory intrusion and scrutiny (resulting in increasing internal compliance costs and supervision fees), and in the event of a breach of our regulatory obligations we are likely to face more stringent regulatory fines. Some of the regulators are focusing strongly on consumer protection and on conduct risk, and will continue to do so. This has included a focus on the design and operation of products, the behavior of customers and the operation of markets.\nSome of the laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, give the regulators the power to make temporary product intervention rules either to improve a firm\u2019s systems and controls in relation to product design, product management and implementation, or to address problems identified with financial products. These problems may potentially cause significant detriment to consumers because of certain product features or governance flaws or distribution strategies. Such rules may prevent institutions from entering into product agreements with customers until such problems have been solved. Some of the regulatory regimes in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate require us to be in compliance across all aspects of our business, including the training, authorization and supervision of personnel, systems, processes and documentation. If we fail to be compliant with such regulations, there would be a risk of an adverse impact on our business from sanctions, fines or other actions imposed by the regulatory authorities.\nCustomers of financial services institutions, including our customers, may seek redress for loss as a result of the mis-selling of a particular product or through incorrect application of the terms and conditions of a particular product. An adverse outcome in litigation related to these matters could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects arising from any penalties imposed or compensation awarded, together with the costs of defending such an action, thereby reducing our profitability.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market in future offerings, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. In addition, the sale of our common stock by our officers and directors or controlling stockholder in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for, or to finance, future acquisitions and investments or for other capital needs. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our shares or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of shares would have on the market price of our common stock. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of ordinary shares or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial and may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. We may also grant registration rights covering shares of our common stock or other securities that we may issue in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance or ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\ndowngrades in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, we are currently operating in, and have benefited from, a protracted period of historically low interest rates that will not be sustained indefinitely, and future fluctuations in interest rates could cause an increase in volatility of the market price of our common stock. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading\nprice of our common stock. The existing and any potential future securities class action litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business or results of operations.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, may have anti-takeover effects, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. In addition, Delaware law may inhibit takeovers of us and could limit our ability to engage in certain strategic transactions our Board believes would be in the best interests of stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws, include provisions that:\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of our stockholders to nominate candidates for election to our Board;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders or to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that may be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by SHUSA, could impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination, or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) generally affects the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. We elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that each of SHUSA and its successors and affiliates and certain of its direct transferees are not deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d and, accordingly, are not subject to such restrictions as long as it and its affiliates own at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nOur common stock is subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness and any preferred stock, and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and, as such, rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities. Additionally, holders of our common stock may become subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of any classes or series of preferred stock that our Board may designate and issue without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors and preferred stockholders.\nSHUSA has significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nSHUSA owns approximately 58.9% of our common stock and, accordingly, has significant influence over us, including and pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement that was entered into among us and certain of our shareholders, including SHUSA, Auto Finance Holdings and DDFS LLC (the \"Shareholders Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, SHUSA has the right to nominate a majority of our directors, provided certain minimum share ownership thresholds are maintained. Further, because SHUSA owns a majority of our common stock, it has the power to elect our entire Board. Through our Board, and through functional reporting lines of SHUSA and SC management, SHUSA controls our policies and operations, including, among other things, the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, and the entering into of extraordinary transactions. Additionally, SHUSA may elect not to permit us to undertake certain actions or activities if SHUSA were to determine that such actions or activities could or would be viewed negatively by the Federal Reserve or other regulators.\nIn addition, the Shareholders Agreement provides the directors nominated by SHUSA with approval rights over certain specific material actions taken by us, provided certain minimum share ownership thresholds are maintained. These material actions include changes in material accounting policies, changes in material tax policies or positions and changes in our principal line of business.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nSHUSA owns a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a separate nominating and governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe utilize these exemptions. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors on our Board. Additionally, our compensation committee is not composed entirely of independent directors, and we do not have a separate nominating and governance committee. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.", "PERMNO": 14414, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "SC"}
