Risk Factors\nCyclicality of Forest Products Industry\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are, and will continue to be, affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry. Prices and demand for logs and manufactured wood products have been, and in the future can be expected to be, subject to cyclical fluctuations. The demand for logs and lumber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity. This activity is subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions, availability and cost of financing for developers, mortgage interest rates, new and existing housing inventory levels, foreclosure rates, population growth, weather conditions, and other factors. Decreases in the level of residential construction activity usually will be reflected in reduced demand for logs and lumber resulting in lower prices for the Company\u2019s products and lower revenues, profits, and cash flows. In addition to housing starts, demand for wood products is also significantly affected by repair and remodeling activities and industrial uses, demand for which has historically been less cyclical. Furthermore, changes in industry supply of timber affect prices. Although the Company believes sales of timber by United States government agencies will remain at relatively low levels for the foreseeable future, any reversal of policy that substantially increases such sales could significantly reduce prices for logs and lumber, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, increased imports from foreign countries could reduce the prices the Company receives for its products. Meanwhile, possible reductions of Canadian imports due to mountain pine beetle infestation could increase prices the Company receives for its products.\nLimitations on the Company\u2019s Ability to Harvest Timber\nRevenues from the Company\u2019s future operations will depend to a significant extent on its ability to harvest timber pursuant to its harvest plans from its 530,000 acres of timberlands (the \u201cTimberlands\u201d). Harvesting of the Timberlands may be affected by various natural factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, severe weather conditions, ice storms, higher than normal amounts of rainfall, and other causes. The effects of these natural factors may be particularly damaging to young timber. To the extent possible, the Company implements measures to limit the risk of damage from such natural causes. The Company is a participant with state agencies and other timberland owners in cooperative fire fighting and fire surveillance programs. In addition, the Timberlands\u2019 extensive system of access roads, firelines, and the physical separation of various tracts provide some protection against fire damage. Nonetheless, one or more major fires on the Timberlands could adversely affect Deltic\u2019s operating results. The Timberlands may also be affected by insect infestation, particularly by the southern pine beetle, and by disease. Additionally, the Timberlands may be affected by severe weather conditions, especially ice storms, tornados, and heavy winds. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting the Timberlands will, in fact, be so limited. As is typical in the forest products industry, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to the Timberlands. The Company does, however, maintain insurance for loss of logs due to fire and other occurrences following their receipt at the Company\u2019s sawmills.\nOperation of Sawmills\nThe Company\u2019s sawmills are located at Ola in central Arkansas and Waldo in south Arkansas. The operations of the sawmills are dependent on various factors, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue such operations at current levels of production or that suspension of such operations may not be required in the future. One such factor is the ability of the Company to procure sufficient logs at suitable prices. The Company obtains logs for its sawmills from the Timberlands, other private sources, and federal lands. As previously discussed, prices for logs are cyclical and affected primarily by demand for lumber and other products produced from logs. Another such factor is the ability of the Company to find an outlet for the large volume of residual wood products that result from the milling process. The Company currently markets such products to third parties for the production of paper and other uses. In addition, the Company uses a significant portion of its residual wood chips at its MDF plant. The continued operation of the sawmills is subject to the risk of business interruption in the event of a fire or other natural disaster, regulatory actions, or other causes. Deltic mitigates this risk through the procurement of casualty and business interruption insurance. On January 30, 2013, the Board of Review of the American Lumber Standard Committee approved new\ndesign values for all sizes and grades of visually graded Southern Pine dimension lumber. The new design values became effective on June 1, 2013. Using MSR machines and visual lumber graders, the Company is capable of providing several product options to its customers. One such option is MSR lumber. The Company anticipates no material impact to its lumber business from these design value changes.\nMDF Plant\nThe Del-Tin Fiber plant manufactures and markets MDF and is located near El Dorado, Arkansas. Construction of the plant was completed and initial production began in 1998, and Deltic became the sole owner on April 1, 2013. Previously Del-Tin Fiber was a joint venture owned 50 percent by Deltic and treated as an equity investment. Demand for MDF is subject to many of the same factors as other wood products such as housing starts, furniture production, residential improvements, import fluctuations, and industry capacity. The industry is also facing higher costs resulting from compliance with California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) regulations. Additionally, the MDF plant operations are subject to risk of business interruption due to fire or other natural disasters, regulatory actions, or other causes. Casualty and business interruption insurance is used to mitigate this risk.\nCompetition\nThe forest products industry is highly competitive in terms of price and quality. The products of the Company are subject to increasing competition from a variety of non-wood and engineered wood products. In addition, the Company is subject to a potential increase in competition from lumber products and logs imported from foreign sources. Any significant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFederal and State Environmental Regulations\nThe Company is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, the provisions and enforcement of which are expected to become more stringent in the future. The Company has made, and will continue to make, non-material expenditures to comply with such provisions. Based on currently available information, the Company believes environmental regulation will not materially adversely affect the Company, but there can be no assurance that environmental regulation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the Company in the future. In December 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency issued new Major Source Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology, \u201cBoiler MACT,\u201d rules that are effective in early 2016. The Company is in the process of reviewing the rules as they apply to the mill facilities and is unable at this time to estimate the cost of compliance with these new rules. Climate control legislation being considered by Congress or potentially more restrictive guidelines issued by governmental regulatory agencies are examples of changes that, if approved, could increase compliance costs as well as direct manufacturing expenses.\nGeographic Concentration and Risk Associated with Real Estate Development\nThe Company\u2019s real estate development projects are located in central Arkansas, specifically, in and west of Little Rock, Arkansas and in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s real estate operations are particularly vulnerable to any economic downturns or other adverse events that may occur in this region and to competition from nearby residential housing developments. The Company\u2019s results of operations may be affected by the cyclicality of the homebuilding and real estate industries. Factors influencing these industries include changes in population growth, general and local economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence and income, housing demand, new and existing housing inventory levels, availability and cost of financing, mortgage interest rates and foreclosures, and changes in government regulation regarding the environment, zoning, real estate taxes, and other local government fees. In addition, the tightening of credit and economic recession could delay or deter commercial real estate activity and may affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nThe ongoing recovery of the housing industry, combined with a steady improvement in the general economy, could provide a positive impact to the operating results for the Company. Similarly, a deterioration of the global credit markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s access to capital. Deltic\u2019s customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain financing could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business if their ability to operate or fund transactions is impaired.\nReliance on Key Personnel\nThe Company believes that its continued success will depend in a large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The Company offers management incentives in a manner that are directly linked to the Company\u2019s performance, which the Company believes will facilitate the attraction, retention, and motivation of highly skilled and qualified personnel. In this regard, the Company has taken steps to retain its key personnel, including the provision of competitive employee benefit programs. Although the Company will seek to employ qualified individuals, in the event that officers or other key employees of the Company cease to be associated with the Company, there is no assurance that such individuals can be engaged by the Company.\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Policy\nPayment of dividends is the means by which Deltic makes distributions to its shareholders of the profits and cash flows generated by the Company\u2019s business operations. These dividends are declared by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The Company\u2019s dividend strategy is to grow the amount of the dividend over time, at a rate of increase that is believed to be sustainable. In addition, Deltic has a stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors. The timing and amount of future dividend increases and repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock are based on the estimated trend for future earnings and cash flows, taking into account other potential uses of the Company\u2019s capital resources including, but not limited to, acquisition opportunities, capital expenditures for existing operations and debt repayments.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Statutory, Charter, Bylaw and Contractual Provisions\nSeveral provisions of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of the Delaware General Corporation Law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or delay unsolicited changes in control of the Company, including provisions creating a classified Board of Directors, limiting the stockholders\u2019 powers to remove directors, and prohibiting the taking of action by written consent in lieu of a stockholders\u2019 meeting. The preferred stock purchase rights attached to the Company\u2019s common stock could have similar anti-takeover effects. In addition, the Company\u2019s Board has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences of and to issue preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of the Company\u2019s common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. Transactions subject to these restrictions will include, among other things, the liquidation of the Company; the merger, consolidation, or other combination or affiliation of the Company with another company; discontinuance of or material change in the conduct of a material portion of its businesses independently and with its own employees; redemption or other reacquisition of the Company\u2019s common stock; and the sale, distribution, or other disposition of assets of the Company out of the ordinary course of business.\nThese provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or delay or prevent changes in control or management of the Company, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nInformation Systems\nSecure information technology systems are relied upon to provide the ability to effectively manage the business data, communications, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes of the Company. These information technology systems and those used by the Company\u2019s third party providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption by circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control,\nincluding fire, natural disasters, system failures, cyber attacks, and viruses. Deltic has made an assessment of the controls involving the information systems and the related cybersecurity issues and has concluded that the failure of the information technology systems to perform adequately may cause temporary data processing or communication inefficiencies but would not have a materially adverse effect on Deltic\u2019s business or operations.\nOil and Gas Leasing and Royalty Revenue\nDeltic receives mineral revenues in the form of oil and gas lease rentals and oil and gas royalties. These properties are operated by other companies, and Deltic has no control over the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety, and other regulations. Oil and natural gas prices, which are volatile, impact the amounts received in royalty revenues and amounts for selling and renewing mineral leases. Therefore, Deltic\u2019s cash flows and results of operation are to a degree dependent on oil and natural gas prices and cannot be predicted or controlled.", "PERMNO": 84365, "SIC": 2421, "TIC": "DEL"}
