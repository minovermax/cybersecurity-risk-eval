{"cik": "839087", "company": "VASOMEDICAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. This could cause the price of our stock to decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nFinancial Risks\nAchieving profitable operations is dependent on several factors.\nOur ability to achieve and sustain profitability is dependent on many factors, primarily being the sufficient and timely generation and recognition of revenue in our Sales Representation segment, the success of our marketing, sales and cost reduction efforts in the Equipment segment, as well as the success of our other strategic initiatives, including our China acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe currently derive the significant amount of our revenue from our agreement with GEHC.\nOn May 19, 2010, we signed a sales representation agreement with GEHC, the healthcare business unit of the General Electric Company, for the sale of select GEHC diagnostic imaging products. Under the GEHC Agreement, we have been appointed the exclusive representative for these products to specific market segments in the 48 contiguous states of the United States and the District of Columbia. The GEHC Agreement had an initial term of three years commencing July 1, 2010 and in 2012 was extended for two additional years to June 30, 2015. In December 2014, the agreement was extended again through December 31, 2018, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances including the right by GEHC to terminate without cause with certain conditions on or after July 1, 2017.\nA significant amount of our revenue and prior periods net income arise from activities under this contract. Moreover, our growth depends partially on the territories, customer segments and product modalities assigned to us by GEHC, and thus relies on our ability to demonstrate our added value as a channel partner, and maintain a positive relationship with GEHC. There is no assurance that the agreement will be renewed before it expires or terminated prior to its expiration pursuant to its termination provisions. Should GEHC terminate or not renew the agreement, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from other companies and technologies.\nWe compete with other companies that market medical devices in the global medical device marketplace. We do not know whether these companies, or other potential competitors who may be developing medical devices, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more efficient or effective than those offered by us, and that would render our technology and existing products obsolete or non-competitive. Potential new competitors may also have substantially greater financial, manufacturing and marketing resources than those possessed by us. In addition, other technologies or products may be developed that have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the intended purpose of our products. Accordingly, the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate. To compete successfully, we must keep pace with technological advancements, respond to evolving consumer requirements and achieve market acceptance.\nWe may not continue to receive necessary FDA clearances or approvals, which could hinder our ability to market and sell our products.\nIf we modify our medical devices and the modifications significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or if we make a change to the intended use, we will be required to submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) or premarket approval (PMA) application to FDA. We would not be able to market the modified device in the U.S. until FDA issues a clearance for the 510(k).\nIf we offer new products that require 510(k) clearance or a PMA, we will not be able to commercially distribute those products until we receive such clearance or approval. Regulatory agency approval or clearance for a product may not be received or may entail limitations on the device\u2019s indications for use that could limit the potential market for the product. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory clearances and approvals, could delay or prevent our ability to market or distribute our products. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our equipment business.\nIf we are unable to comply with applicable governmental regulations, we may not be able to continue certain of our operations.\nWe also must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements as set forth in the Quality System Regulation (QSR) to receive FDA approval to market new products and to continue to market current products. The QSR imposes certain procedural and documentation requirements on us with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities, including packaging, storage, and record keeping. Our products and activities are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation, including regulation of labeling and promotion activities and adverse event reporting. Also, our FDA registered facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental authorities. Any failure to comply with regulatory requirements could delay or prevent our ability to market or distribute our products. Violation of FDA statutory or regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions, such as voluntary or mandatory recalls, suspension or withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals, seizures, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecutions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most states also have similar post-market regulatory and enforcement authority for devices.\nOur operations in China are also subject to the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China with which we must be in compliance in order to conduct these operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, either domestically or internationally, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. We may be slow to adapt, or we may never adapt to changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies. We may incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future or compliance with laws or regulations may create an unsustainable burden on our business.\nWe have foreign operations and are subject to the associated risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had and continues to have operations in China. Operating internationally involves additional risks relating to such things as currency exchange rates, different legal and regulatory environments, political, economic risks relating to the stability or predictability of foreign governments, differences in the manner in which different cultures do business, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, differences in financial reporting, operating difficulties, and other factors. The occurrence of any of these risks, if severe enough, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.\nCommercial law is still developing in China and there are limited legal precedents to follow in commercial transactions. There are many tax jurisdictions each of which may have changing tax laws. Applicable taxes include value added taxes (VAT), corporate income tax, and social (payroll) taxes. Regulations are often unclear. Tax declarations (reports) are subject to review and taxing authorities may impose fines, penalties and interest. These facts create risks for our operations in China.\nWe may not receive approvals by foreign regulators that are necessary for international sales.\nSales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. Premarket approval or clearance in the United States does not ensure regulatory approval or clearance by other jurisdictions. If we, or any of our international distributors, fail to obtain or maintain required pre-market approvals or fail to comply with foreign regulations, foreign regulatory authorities may require us to file revised governmental notifications, cease commercial sales of our products in the applicable countries or otherwise cure the problem. Such enforcement action by regulatory authorities may be costly.\nIn order to sell our products within the European Union, we must comply with the European Union\u2019s Medical Device Directive. The CE marking on our products attests to this compliance. Future regulatory changes may limit our ability to use the CE mark, and any new products we develop may not qualify for the CE mark. If we lose this authorization or fail to obtain authorization on future products, we will not be able to sell our products in the European Union.\nWe depend on suppliers for the supply of certain products.\nWhile we now manufacture our own EECP\u00ae product primarily through one of our China based facilities, we still depend on certain independent suppliers for parts, components and certain finished goods. While we do not foresee any difficulties in timely receiving products at competitive prices, the inability of not receiving products in timely fashion or at competitive prices would adversely affect our business. In addition, as a GEHC channel partner, we could be negatively impacted by interruptions or delays to equipment installations, production and quality issues, and other customer concerns related to GEHC.\nWe depend on management and other key personnel.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees may harm our business if we are unable to identify other individuals to provide us with similar services. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees. In addition, our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, sales, manufacturing and research and development personnel in our various operations. We face competition in our recruiting activities and may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel.\nWe may not have adequate intellectual property protection.\nOur patents and proprietary technology may not be able to prevent competition by others. The validity and breadth of claims in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions. Future patent applications may not be issued, the scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors, and our patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. Our patents may be found to be invalid and other companies may claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held or licensed by us. Also, our existing patents may not cover products that we develop in the future. Moreover, when our patents expire, the inventions will enter the public domain. There can be no assurance that our patents will not be violated or that any issued patents will provide protection that has commercial significance. Litigation may be necessary to protect our patent position. Such litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such litigation.\nThe loss or violation of certain of our patents and trademarks could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nSince patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until such patent applications are issued, our current product development may infringe patents that may be issued to others. If our products were found to infringe patents held by competitors, we may have to modify our products to avoid infringement, and it is possible that our modified products would not be commercially successful.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell products decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nOur growth depends in part on the growth of the healthcare markets which we serve. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders installed during the quarter, and the installation of such orders is difficult to forecast. Product demand is dependent upon the customer\u2019s capital spending budget as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles that can affect the spending decisions of these entities. These factors could adversely affect our growth, financial position, and results of operations.\nTechnological change is difficult to predict and to manage.\nWe face the challenges that are typically faced by companies in the medical device field. Our product line has required, and any future products will require, substantial development efforts and compliance with governmental clearance or approval requirements. We may encounter unforeseen technological or scientific problems that force abandonment or substantial change in the development of a specific product or process.\nWe are subject to product liability claims and product recalls that may not be covered by insurance.\nThe nature of our manufacturing operations exposes us to risks of product liability claims and product recalls. Medical devices as complex as ours frequently experience errors or failures, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance at $5,000,000 per occurrence and $6,000,000 in the aggregate. Our product liability insurance may not be adequate. In the future, insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, product liability claims or product recalls could damage our reputation even if we have adequate insurance coverage.\nWe do not know the effects of healthcare reform proposals.\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes resulting from political, economic and regulatory influences. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act was adopted which is designed to provide increased access to healthcare for the uninsured, control the escalation of healthcare expenditures within the economy and use healthcare reimbursement policies to balance the federal budget.\nWe expect that the United States Congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess the Affordable Care Act as well as various healthcare reform proposals, and public debate of these issues will likely continue. There have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to constrain expenditures for medical products and services, which may affect payments for products such as ours. We cannot predict which, if any of such reform proposals will be adopted and when they might be effective, or the effect these proposals may have on our business. Other countries also are considering health reform. Significant changes in healthcare systems could have a substantial impact on the manner in which we conduct our business and could require us to revise our strategies.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe application of the \"penny stock\" rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares.\nAs long as the trading price of our common shares is below $5 per share, the open-market trading of our common shares will be subject to the \"penny stock\" rules. The \"penny stock\" rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the broker-dealer must deliver, before the transaction, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability or decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to sell our common shares, and may result in decreased liquidity for our common shares and increased transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common shares as compared to other securities.\nOur common stock is subject to price volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been and may continue to be highly volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 medical reimbursement;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations, new products or pricing by our competitors;\n\u00b7 the rate of adoption by physicians of our technology and products in targeted markets;\n\u00b7 the timing of patent and regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the timing and extent of technological advancements;\n\u00b7 results of clinical studies;\n\u00b7 the sales of our common stock by affiliates or other shareholders with large holdings; and\n\u00b7 general market conditions.\nOur future operating results may fall below the expectations of securities industry analysts or investors. Any such shortfall could result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of the stock of many medical device companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may directly influence the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAdditional Information\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are required to file reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including reports on the following forms: annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports files or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934.", "PERMNO": 12171, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "VASO"}
