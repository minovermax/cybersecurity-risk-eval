RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF\u2019s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect VF\u2019s business, its operating results and its financial condition.\nECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS\nVF\u2019s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on VF.\nThe success of VF\u2019s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, interest rates, consumer credit availability, inflationary pressures (such as current inflation related to global supply chain disruptions), unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions and natural disasters, energy prices, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical instability (such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related economic and other retaliatory measures taken by the United States, European Union and others), consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF\u2019s products are sold. Decreased consumer spending could result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve, adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on VF.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has been, and could continue to be, impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories where we operate and our employees, suppliers, third-party service providers, consumers or customers are located. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government recommendations or mandates, as well as decisions we made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, our operations where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold were temporarily closed, or operated with limited operating hours and limited occupancy levels. Most of our operations have reopened, but there continues to be uncertainty around the extent to which operations may be closed again or experience operational restrictions if and where there is a resurgence in COVID-19 or new variants of the virus emerge, and the duration and severity of any related restrictions. Some of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business have included, and could continue to include, the following:\n\u2022significant reductions in demand and significant volatility in demand for our products by consumers and customers resulting in reduced orders, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories, decreased value of inventories and lower gross margins, which continue to be caused by, among other things: the\ninability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions or out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, phased reopenings and reclosures of our owned stores as well as stores of our customers or reduced store hours across the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions due to a resurgence of COVID-19, significant declines in consumer retail store traffic to stores that have reopened, or financial hardship and unemployment, shifts in demand away from consumer discretionary products and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022significant uncertainty and turmoil in global economic and financial market conditions causing, among other things: decreased consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending, now and in the mid- and long-term, inability to access financing in the credit and capital markets (including the commercial paper market) at reasonable rates (or at all) in the event we, our customers or suppliers find it desirable to do so, increased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, and volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use for our products and in our supply chain;\n\u2022inability to meet our consumers\u2019 and customers\u2019 needs for inventory production and fulfillment due to disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic caused by, among other things: reduction or loss of workforce due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions or facility closures, including vaccine mandates or return to work policies, scarcity of and/or increased prices for raw materials, scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, capacity constraints, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion and increased freight and logistics costs, expenses and times; failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, customers, distributors, service providers and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, including business failure or insolvency and collectability of existing receivables;\n\u2022significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we do business, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions, including voluntarily adopted practices, that limit or close operating and manufacturing facilities and restrict our employees\u2019 ability to perform necessary business functions, including operations necessary for the design, development, production, distribution, sale, marketing and support of our products and increase the likelihood of litigation;\n\u2022increased costs, including increased employee costs, such as for expanded benefits and essential employee\n10 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K\nincentives, and increased operating costs, including those associated with provision of personal protective equipment and compliance with governmental or public health organization mandates or guidance, allowances or extended payment terms for customers, and inventory write-offs, all of which have negatively impacted our profitability;\n\u2022increased risk to the health, safety and wellness, including mental and emotional health, of our employees due to the virus or the impact of related restrictions;\n\u2022increased tax risk related to employees working remotely in a tax location other than their normal work location; and\n\u2022amplified data security risks as a result of more employees working remotely, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, increased phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices.\nThese impacts have placed, and could continue to place limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and procedures as more information and guidance become available. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, any of which could have a material effect on us. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and any resurgences of COVID-19, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive, and VF\u2019s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets.\nVF competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in some product categories and regions. In addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF\u2019s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:\n\u2022anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner;\n\u2022develop attractive, innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs;\n\u2022maintain strong brand recognition;\n\u2022price products appropriately;\n\u2022provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence and optimize and react to available consumer data;\n\u2022ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;\n\u2022obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail;\n\u2022produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis; and\n\u2022adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape.\nFailure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets, technology, business model and product trends could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail (e-commerce and retail store) channels, which have been accelerated because of the COVID-19 pandemic. VF may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently, which could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect VF's business.\nRecently there have been consolidations, reorganizations, restructurings, bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and could continue to result, in closed stores, and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing. These events individually, and together, could have (and, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, have had) a material, adverse effect on VF's business. These changes could impact VF\u2019s opportunities in the market and increase VF\u2019s reliance on a smaller number of large customers. In the future, retailers are likely to further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets. In addition, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry VF\u2019s products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to VF or an increase in leverage by VF\u2019s customers over their suppliers.\nFurther, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel, footwear and other consumer products. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to VF relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF\u2019s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nVF\u2019s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nThe apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, rising commodity and conversion costs, inflation, rising freight costs, rising labor costs, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing. Customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF\u2019s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 11\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nVF\u2019s business and the success of its products could be harmed if VF is unable to maintain the images of its brands.\nVF\u2019s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands\u2019 images and VF\u2019s customers\u2019 connection to its brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding VF, its brands or its products, including licensed products, or its culture and values, or its employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. The rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online marketing, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes, musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality sponsorships and endorsers could harm our business. In addition, actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations, which could adversely affect the images of our brands. Our reputation and brand image also could be damaged as a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations.\nVF\u2019s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.\nVF\u2019s business is seasonal, with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s full year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.\nWe may be adversely affected by weather conditions.\nOur business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. A significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. For example, periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to reduced consumer spending that negatively impacts VF's direct-to-consumer business, and inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers, which can, in turn, negatively affect orders in future seasons. In addition, abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. Any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nVF may not succeed in its business strategy.\nOne of VF\u2019s key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and through acquisitions. We seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers, stretching VF\u2019s brands to new regions, leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF and expanding our direct-to-consumer business, including opening new stores, remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our e-commerce business. However, we may not be able to grow our business. For example:\n\u2022We may have difficulty completing acquisitions or dispositions to reshape our portfolio, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration, or it may disrupt our current business.\n\u2022We may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer- and retail-centric.\n\u2022We may not be able to transform our model to be more digitally focused.\n\u2022We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of VF products.\n\u2022We may not be able to successfully distort investments to Asia or meet evolving consumer needs to unlock growth opportunities for our brands or expand in other geographies.\n\u2022We may not be able to effectively deploy resources and allocate capital towards investments in new and organic businesses and capabilities in order to drive strategic objectives.\n\u2022We may not be able to achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives and establish and maintain effective supply chain systems, data, and capabilities, infrastructure, and the sourcing strategy necessary to optimally meet current and future business needs.\n\u2022We may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees.\n\u2022We may not be able to achieve our direct-to-consumer expansion goals, including in e-commerce or other new channels, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations, operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably, adapt our business model or develop relationships with consumers for e-commerce or other new channels.\n\u2022We may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements.\nFailure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s business.\nMoreover, VF is engaged in a business model transformation to become more consumer-minded, retail-centric and hyper-digital. Failure to successfully execute VF\u2019s transformation agenda at a fast enough pace with clear objectives, assignments, accountability, project management, governance and\n12 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K\nappropriate consideration for change management could result in a diminished ability to remain competitive.\nFurther, organizational effectiveness, agility and execution are important to VF\u2019s success. Failure to create an agile and efficient operating model and organizational structure or to effectively define, prioritize, and align on clear achievable and appropriately resourced strategic priorities could result in an inability to remain competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace and lead to increase in costs, inefficient resource allocation, reduced productivity, organizational confusion, and reduced employee morale.\nVF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm VF\u2019s ability to effectively operate its business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain. We are also dependent on information technology, including the Internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage, failure or interruption due to viruses, data security incidents, technical malfunctions, natural disasters or other causes, or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or remain innovative, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of VF\u2019s business, including our reputation, management of inventory, ordering and replenishment of products, sourcing and distribution of products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media. Moreover, failure to provide effective digital (including omnichannel) capabilities and information technology infrastructure could result in an inability to meet current and future business needs and a resulting loss of brand competitiveness, leading to loss of revenue and market share and decreased business agility.\nVF is subject to data and information security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations, results of operations or reputation.\nIn the normal course of business, we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information and employee information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information collected, retained or transmitted over the Internet, identity theft and user privacy. Data and information security breaches are increasingly sophisticated, and can be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Accordingly, if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our third-party service providers, they may be able to steal, publish, delete, hold ransom or modify our private and sensitive information, including credit card information, personal information, and confidential or other proprietary business information. We have implemented systems and processes\ndesigned to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information and other confidential information, and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of such information, including credit card information. Despite these security measures, there is no guarantee that they will prevent all unauthorized access to our systems and information, and our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. VF and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data, or employee, customer and other confidential and proprietary information were corrupted, lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in VF\u2019s systems or due to one of our third-party service providers or our employees. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation, confidence in our e-commerce platforms and our relationships with customers and employees, result in business disruption, unwanted and negative media attention and lost sales, and expose us to risks of litigation, liability and increased scrutiny from regulatory entities. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the privacy and security of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new data protection laws and regulations being adopted around the world. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations and consumer expectations surrounding the privacy and security of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risk, including significant fines and/or litigation for non-compliance in multiple jurisdictions, negative media coverage, diminished consumer confidence and decreased attraction to our brands, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. In addition, while we maintain cyber insurance policies, those existing insurance policies may not adequately protect VF from all of the adverse effects and damages that could be caused by a security breach. Moreover, if our associates or vendors, intentionally or inadvertently, misuse consumer data or are not transparent with consumers about how we use their data, our brands, reputation and relationships with consumers could be damaged.\nThere are risks associated with VF\u2019s acquisitions and portfolio management.\nAny acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions. Moreover, failure to effectively manage VF\u2019s portfolio of brands in line with growth targets and shareholder expectations, including acquisition choices, integration approach and divestiture timing could result in unfavorable impacts to growth and value creation.\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 13\nOur acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.\nVF uses third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for its raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF\u2019s business operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, VF\u2019s products were sourced from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia. Any of the following could impact our ability to source or deliver VF products, or our cost of sourcing or delivering products and, as a result, our profitability:\n\u2022political or labor instability in countries where VF\u2019s contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022changes in local economic conditions in countries where VF\u2019s contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in (or could continue to result in) closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u2022disruption at ports of entry, could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;\n\u2022heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or lengthier inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u2022decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF products, increased costs for VF\u2019s anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;\n\u2022disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities or in shipping and transportation locations caused by natural and man-made disasters;\n\u2022imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to source products in cost-effective countries that have the required labor and expertise;\n\u2022imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and\n\u2022imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nAlthough no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF\u2019s production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.\nIn addition, although we audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards, actions by a third-party supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could result in such third-party supplier failing to manufacture products that consistently meet our quality standards or engaging in unfavorable labor practices or providing unfavorable working conditions that negatively impact worker health, safety and wellness. Such noncompliance could expose VF to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations.\nA significant portion of VF\u2019s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay VF could substantially reduce VF\u2019s revenues and profits.\nA few of VF\u2019s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF\u2019s ten largest customers were approximately 17% of total revenues in Fiscal 2022, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 2% of revenues. Sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of VF\u2019s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nTalent management, employee retention and experience are important factors in VF\u2019s success.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience and maintain a culture of wellbeing, empowerment and diversity and inclusion to ensure VF is innovative and remains competitive in a rapidly-changing global marketplace. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, developing, and retaining such personnel, which could impact VF\u2019s ability to remain competitive. Additionally, changes to our office environments, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As businesses increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in VF\u2019s business, and in developing and retaining employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on VF.\n14 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K\nVF\u2019s direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nVF sells merchandise direct to consumer through VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites. Its direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside VF\u2019s control, (ii) failure or interruption of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including due to computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, technical malfunctions, and natural disasters or other causes (iii) credit card fraud, (iv) risks related to VF\u2019s direct-to-consumer distribution centers and processes, and (v) shift in consumer preferences away from retail stores. Risks specific to VF\u2019s e-commerce business also include (i) diversion of sales from VF stores or wholesale customers, (ii) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, (iii) liability for online content, (iv) changing patterns of consumer behavior, and (v) intense competition from online retailers. VF\u2019s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its e-commerce business, as well as damage its reputation and brands.\nOur VF-operated stores and e-commerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our direct-to-consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\nVF\u2019s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space.\nA significant portion of our revenues are direct-to-consumer sales through VF-operated stores. In order to generate customer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be harmed. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nVF\u2019s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position. VF is\nsusceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights, especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years. Some of VF\u2019s brands, such as Vans\u00ae, The North Face\u00ae, Timberland\u00ae, Dickies\u00ae and Supreme\u00ae enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the higher pricing of certain of the brands' products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement.\nVF\u2019s trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to VF\u2019s success. Counterfeiting of VF\u2019s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect VF\u2019s revenues. Actions we have taken to establish and protect VF\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF\u2019s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, such as the Russian government's recent announcements that it would not protect intellectual property rights, including patent rights and rights that could block parallel imports of gray market goods, as a result of the sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, could have an impact on VF\u2019s ability to enforce those rights.\nThe value of VF\u2019s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are similar to VF\u2019s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses from others. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF\u2019s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks.\nThere have been, and there may in the future be, opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of VF's intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending any such claim, regardless of merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on VF's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF\u2019s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.\nVF relies on owned or leased VF-operated and third party-operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to VF customers. VF\u2019s distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 15\nnumber of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of VF\u2019s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, VF\u2019s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters or other events outside VF's control affecting its distribution centers, including political or labor instability. We maintain business interruption insurance under our property and cyber insurance policies, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in VF\u2019s distribution facilities. In addition, VF\u2019s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nVF\u2019s business and operations could be materially and adversely affected if it fails to create systems of monitoring, prevention, response, crisis management, continuity and recovery to mitigate natural or man-made economic, political or environmental disruptions.\nBusiness resiliency is important to VF\u2019s success because there are a variety of risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis that may involve natural or man-made economic, political or environmental disruptions. Disruptions, and government responses to any disruption, could cause, among other things, a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales, delays in the fulfillment or cancellation of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products, increased costs and a negative impact on our reputation and long-term growth plans. The impact of disruptions may vary based on the length and severity of the disruption. VF\u2019s failure to create and implement systems of monitoring, prevention, response, crisis management, continuity and recovery to anticipate, prepare, prevent, mitigate, and respond to potential threats impacting its business, people, processes and facilities could result in extended disruptions and unpredictability.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nVF\u2019s operations and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic uncertainty and risks.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic uncertainty and risks. These include the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect VF\u2019s business or may require us to modify our current business practices. While enactment of any such change is not certain, if such changes were adopted or if we failed to anticipate and mitigate the impact of such changes, our costs could increase, which would reduce our earnings. For example, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the European Union (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The United Kingdom and the European Union subsequently reached a provisional post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement that contains new rules governing the relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe, including with respect to trade, travel and immigration. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBeginning in February 2022, in response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises, and the continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. To date, we have experienced revenue impacts due to cessation of business in Russia, currency devaluation, and costs associated with compliance with sanctions and other regulations. In addition, as of April 2, 2022, there was approximately $31.0 million of cash in Russia that, although it can be used without limits within Russia, is currently limited on\nmovement out of Russia. Further impacts of the conflict could include macro financial impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy, heightened cybersecurity threats, harm to employee health and safety, reputational harm, increase in counterfeiting and intellectual property activity, nationalization of our assets, and additional costs associated with compliance with sanctions and other regulations and risks associated with failure to comply with the same. Although our operations in Russia are not significant, the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns, including in other geographies, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. or international trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. For example, the U.S. government has instituted changes in trade policies imposing higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. Tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted, considered or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. VF, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a\n16 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and tax liabilities and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Act\u201d), which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax-deferred, and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings. Taxes related to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due over a period of time could be accelerated upon certain triggering events, including failure to pay such taxes when due. In addition, regulatory, administrative and legislative guidance related to the U.S. Tax Act continues to be released. To the extent any future guidance differs from our interpretation of the law, or the current U.S. Presidential Administration takes further action, including through its proposal of a higher U.S. federal corporate tax rate and increased taxation of offshore income, such guidance or action could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, many countries in the European Union (\"EU\") and around the globe have adopted and/or proposed changes to current tax laws. Further, organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") have published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could increase our tax obligations and compliance costs in these countries. More specifically, the OECD has released rules to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The ultimate outcome of these rules that are enacted into law in each country may result in a material financial impact to VF.\nDue to the large scale of our U.S. and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws.\nAs a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of U.S. and international tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits and court proceedings. In particular, tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no- or low-tax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction. Tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries.\nFor example, VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium\u2019s excess profit tax regime. During\n2015, the EU investigated and announced its decision that the ruling was illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under the ruling should be collected from the affected companies, including VF Europe, BVBA, a subsidiary of VF. Requests for annulment were filed by Belgium and VF Europe BVBA, individually. During 2017 and 2018, VF Europe BVBA was assessed and paid \u20ac35.0 million in tax and interest, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the expected success of the requests for annulment. During 2019, the General Court annulled the EU decision and the EU subsequently appealed the General Court\u2019s annulment. In September 2021, the General Court\u2019s judgment was set aside by the Court of Justice of the EU and the case was sent back to the General Court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal State aid. The case remains open and unresolved. If this matter is adversely resolved, the tax and interest amounts paid by VF will not be collected by VF.\nAlso, as previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the \"Court\") to resolve an Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF's acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue, and on January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and intends to appeal; however, VF will be required to pay the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed or post a surety bond. It is anticipated that during Fiscal 2023, the IRS will assess, and VF will pay, the 2011 taxes and interest, which would be recorded as a tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case. The gross amount of taxes and interest as of April 2, 2022 was estimated at approximately $845.0 million and will continue to accrue interest until paid. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this tax receivable may not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF\u2019s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense estimated as of April 2, 2022 could be up to $700.0 million.\nAlthough we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings, or court interpretations (involving VF or other companies with similar tax profiles) may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, corporate governance, competition, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as well as on our reputation.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental,\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 17\nclimate change, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. VF could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, safety, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by VF from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.\nFailure by VF or its third-party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, safety, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, extensive remediation efforts, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. If VF or one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws, implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical, it could result in unwanted or negative media attention, jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for VF\u2019s merchandise. Damage to VF\u2019s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild VF\u2019s reputation.\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nClimate change and increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities, may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation.\nClimate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways. Failure to monitor, adapt, build\nresilience, and develop solutions against the physical and transitional impacts from climate change may lead to revenue loss, market share loss, business interruptions, and rising costs. Climate change could lead to increased volatility due to physical impacts of climate change on the supply chain, including the availability, quality and cost of raw materials. Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (storms and floods) could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, and other stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, employees, and consumers, have focused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") and related sustainability practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments and/or have higher expectations of corporate conduct. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, including related to climate change, sustainability, and human rights, and do not meet related regulations and expectations for increased transparency, which continue to evolve, our brands, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. While we may announce voluntary ESG targets, we may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including, but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices and regulations. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to manage reputational threats and meet stakeholder expectations or shifting consumer preferences with respect to socially responsible activities and products and packaging and sustainability commitments and regulations could negatively impact our brand, image, reputation, credibility, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nVF\u2019s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in VF\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Operations and could be material.\nVF\u2019s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less\nthan its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference.\nIt is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2023 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible\n18 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K\nassets. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nFluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of purchased finished goods or the fabrics, leather, cotton or other raw materials used therein could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers\u2019 demands. Prices of purchased finished products may depend on wage rate increases required by legal or industry standards in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as increasing freight costs from those regions. Inflation, including as a result of inflationary pressures related to global supply chain disruptions, can also have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost and availability of the materials that are used in our products, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as cotton, dyes and chemical and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate significantly as a result of inflation in addition to many other factors, including general economic conditions and demand, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and speculation in the commodities markets. A significant portion of our products also are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. In the future, VF may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers. This could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nVF\u2019s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. VF\u2019s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.\nA growing percentage of VF\u2019s total revenues (approximately 48% in Fiscal 2022) is derived from markets outside the U.S. VF\u2019s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which VF\u2019s international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for VF\u2019s U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors located in foreign countries. As a result, the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of VF\u2019s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk.\nFurther, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit\nratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on VF\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.\nAny disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future. Future volatility in the financial and credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the conflict in Ukraine, could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises, including upon maturity, or on terms that would be acceptable to us. This disruption or volatility could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the publication of LIBOR on a representative basis ceased for the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and all sterling, yen, euros, and Swiss franc LIBOR settings. All other remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease July 1, 2023. In connection with the sunset of certain LIBOR reference rates occurring at the end of 2021, we amended the credit agreement for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to include provisions for the replacement of LIBOR upon the cessation thereof that are customary for credit facilities of this nature. We continue to monitor developments related to the upcoming transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR settings to an alternative benchmark reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. At this time, the effects of the phase out of U.S. dollar LIBOR and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined, but uncertainty regarding rates may make borrowing or refinancing our indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable.\nVF\u2019s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent VF from fulfilling its financial obligations, and VF may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings, may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants.\nAs of April 2, 2022, VF had approximately $5.4 billion of debt outstanding. VF\u2019s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022require VF to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to repaying its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, dividends, repurchase VF\u2019s common stock and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit VF\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 19\n\u2022place VF at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less indebtedness outstanding; and\n\u2022negatively affect VF's credit ratings and limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in VF\u2019s debt documents and its ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, VF may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes. If VF incurs additional indebtedness, it may limit VF\u2019s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs.\nAlthough VF has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs, any determinations by the board of directors to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on VF\u2019s common stock or to repurchase VF\u2019s common stock will be based primarily upon VF\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors\u2019 continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of VF\u2019s shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. In the event VF does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases, VF\u2019s stock price could be adversely affected.\nVF is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents. Failure by VF to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on VF if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable.\nVF is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of VF\u2019s brands.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, $66.6 million of VF\u2019s revenues were derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has significant control over its licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect VF\u2019s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a licensee\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022obtain capital;\n\u2022manage its labor relations;\n\u2022maintain relationships with its suppliers;\n\u2022manage its credit risk effectively;\n\u2022maintain relationships with its customers; and\n\u2022adhere to VF\u2019s Global Compliance Principles.\nIn addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we attempt to protect VF\u2019s brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely\ncontrol the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee, including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards, could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on VF.\nVolatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase VF\u2019s defined benefit pension costs.\nVF currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on investment assets and the discount rates used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets, decreases in discount rates, changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for VF\u2019s business.\nVF\u2019s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans. Pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense, which can create volatility that adversely impacts VF\u2019s future operating results.\nThe spin-off of Kontoor Brands, Inc. could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders.\nWe received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the May 22, 2019 spin-off of our Jeans business, Kontoor Brands, Inc. (\"Kontoor Brands\") and certain related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions, the spin-off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Kontoor Brands in connection with the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution would be taxable to us (but not to our shareholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of Kontoor Brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Kontoor Brands, pursuant to which Kontoor Brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. In addition, these potential tax liabilities may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\n20 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 43553, "SIC": 2320, "TIC": "VFC"}
