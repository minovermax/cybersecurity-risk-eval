Wertheim\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary (officer since January 2000)\nAnthony McKiernan\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Portfolio Officer (officer since August 2011)\nItem 1. Business (continued)\nJoseph W. Brown is Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. Mr. Brown assumed the roles of Chairman, CEO and director in February of 2008 after having retired as Executive Chairman of MBIA in May of 2007. In May of 2009, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors accepted Mr. Brown\u2019s recommendation to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO and elected Daniel P. Kearney as Non-Executive Chairman, with Mr. Brown continuing in the roles of CEO and director. Mr. Brown also serves as Chairman of MBIA Corp. Until May of 2004, Mr. Brown had served as Chairman and CEO of MBIA and MBIA Corp. Mr. Brown originally joined the Company as CEO in January of 1999 after having been a director since 1986, and became Chairman in May of 1999.\nPrior to joining MBIA in 1999, Mr. Brown was Chairman and CEO of Talegen Holdings, Inc., an insurance holding company. Before his election as Chairman and CEO of Talegen, Mr. Brown was President and CEO of Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company. Mr. Brown joined Fireman\u2019s Fund in 1974. He held numerous executive positions including Chief Financial Officer at the time of its IPO in 1985 from American Express and President and Chief Operating Officer at the time of its sale to Allianz AG in 1990.\nMr. Brown served on the board of Oxford Health Plans from 2000 to 2004 and on the Board of Fireman\u2019s Fund Holdings prior to the sale of its insurance subsidiary to Allianz. He served on the Safeco Corporation board from 2001 to September of 2008 and was elected Non-executive Chairman in January of 2006.\nThe Board of Directors of MBIA Inc. appointed Messrs. Chaplin, Fallon and Wertheim to the offices set forth opposite their names above on November 6, 2008 and appointed Mr. McKiernan to the offices set forth opposite his name above on May 1, 2012.\nPrior to being named President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, C. Edward Chaplin was Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Chaplin also serves as Chief Financial Officer of MBIA Corp. and President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Administrative Officer of MBIA Services Corporation. Prior to becoming an officer of the Company in June of 2006, Mr. Chaplin had served as a director of the Company from December of 2002 to May of 2006 and as Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Prudential Financial Inc. since November of 2000, responsible for Prudential\u2019s capital and liquidity management, corporate finance, and banking and cash management. Mr. Chaplin had been with Prudential since 1983.\nPrior to being named President and Chief Operating Officer, William C. Fallon was Vice President of the Company and head of the Global Structured Finance Division. Mr. Fallon also serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of National. From July of 2005 to March 1, 2007, Mr. Fallon was Vice President of the Company and head of Corporate and Strategic Planning. Prior to joining the Company in 2005, Mr. Fallon was a partner at McKinsey & Company and co-leader of that firm\u2019s Corporate Finance and Strategy Practice.\nPrior to being named Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Ram D. Wertheim was Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Wertheim also serves as General Counsel and Secretary of MBIA Corp. and MBIA Services Corporation. From February of 1998 until January of 2000, he served in various capacities in the Global Structured Finance Division. Mr. Wertheim was, until February of 1998, the General Counsel of CMAC Holdings Inc.\nPrior to being named Executive Vice President and Chief Portfolio Officer on May 1, 2012, Anthony McKiernan was appointed Vice President and Chief Portfolio Officer of the Company on August 3, 2011. Mr. McKiernan is also the President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Risk Officer of MBIA Corp. Mr. McKiernan joined MBIA in 2000 as a vice president in the Credit Analytics Group, and managed the Corporate Insured Portfolio Management Group prior to becoming the Head of the Structured Finance Insured Portfolio Management Group in 2007. Before working at MBIA, Mr. McKiernan was with Fleet Financial Group where he began his career as a Credit Analyst/ Lender in asset-based lending.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nReferences in the risk factors to the \u201cCompany\u201d are to MBIA Inc., together with its domestic and international subsidiaries. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d are to MBIA Inc. or the Company, as the context requires. Our risk factors are grouped into categories and are presented in the following order: \u201cInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cStrategic Plan Related and Other Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors.\u201d Risk factors are listed in order of significance within each category.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\nSome of the state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities that issue public finance obligations we insure are experiencing unprecedented fiscal stress that could result in increased credit losses or impairments on those obligations.\nWe have historically experienced low levels of defaults in our United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) public finance insured portfolio, including during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. Although the financial condition of many state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities that issue the obligations we insure has improved since the financial crisis, some issuers continue to report fiscal stress that has required them to significantly raise taxes or cut spending in order to satisfy their obligations. In particular, certain jurisdictions have significantly underfunded pension liabilities which are placing additional stress on their finances and are particularly challenging to restructure either through negotiation or under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, cut spending, or receive state or federal assistance, we may experience losses or impairments on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This severe financial stress could result in more Chapter 9 proceedings in states where municipal issuers are permitted to seek bankruptcy protection. In these proceedings, which remain rare, the resolution of bondholder claims (and by extension those of bond insurers) remains uncertain and subject to further litigation in several pending cases.\nLoss reserve estimates and credit impairments are subject to additional uncertainties and loss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential claims.\nThe financial guarantees issued by our insurance companies insure the financial performance of the obligations guaranteed over an extended period of time, in some cases over 30 years, under policies that we have, in most circumstances, no right to cancel. We do not use traditional actuarial approaches to determine our loss reserves. The establishment of the appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving numerous estimates and subjective judgments by management, and therefore, there can be no assurance that actual paid claims in our insured portfolio will not exceed its loss reserves. If our loss reserves are not adequate to cover actual paid claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we use both internal models as well as models generated by third-party consultants and customized by us to project future paid claims on our insured portfolio and establish loss reserves. Since our insured credit derivatives have similar terms, conditions, risks, and economic profiles to our financial guarantee insurance policies, we evaluate them for impairment periodically in the same way that we estimate loss and LAE for our financial guarantee policies. There can be no assurance that the future loss projections based on these models are accurate.\nSmall changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates could significantly impact loss expectations. For example, our loss reserves are discounted to a net present value reflecting MBIA\u2019s general obligation to pay claims over time and not on an accelerated basis. Risk-free rates are used to discount our loss reserves under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and the yield-to-maturity of each insurer\u2019s investment portfolio as of year-end is used to discount each insurer\u2019s loss reserves under statutory accounting principles. Accordingly, changes in the risk-free rates or the yield in our insurers\u2019 investment portfolios may materially impact loss reserves.\nPolitical and economic conditions in the United States, the Eurozone and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a financial guarantee company, our insured exposures and our results of operations can be materially affected by general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and around the world. General global unrest, fraud, terrorism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, pandemics or similar events could disrupt the economy in the U.S. and other countries where we have insured exposure or operate our businesses. In certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. we face higher risks of governmental intervention through nationalization or expropriation of assets, changes in regulation, an inability to enforce our rights in court or otherwise and corruption, which may cause us to incur losses on the exposures we insure or reputational harm. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to sovereign debt, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-European Sovereign Debt Exposure\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nBudget deficits at all levels of government in the U.S., recessions, increases in corporate, municipal, sovereign, sub-sovereign or consumer default rates and other general economic conditions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s prospects for future business, as well as the performance of our insured portfolios and the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. In addition, we are exposed to correlation risk as a result of the possibility that multiple credits will experience losses as a result of any such event or series of events, in particular exposures that are backed by revenues from business and personal travel, such as aircraft securitizations and bonds backed by hotel taxes and car rental fleet securitizations.\nFinancial modeling involves uncertainty over ultimate outcomes, which makes it difficult to estimate liquidity, potential paid claims, loss reserves and fair values.\nThe Company uses third-party and internal financial models to estimate liquidity, potential paid claims, loss reserves and fair values. We use internal financial models to conduct liquidity stress-scenario testing to ensure that we maintain cash and liquid securities in an amount in excess of all stress scenario payment requirements. These measurements are performed on a legal entity and operating segment basis. We also rely on financial models, generated internally and supplemented by models generated by third parties, to estimate factors relating to the highly complex securities we insure, including future credit performance of the underlying assets, and to evaluate structures, rights and our potential obligations over time. We also use internal models for ongoing portfolio monitoring and to estimate case basis loss reserves and, where applicable, to report our obligations under our contracts at fair value. We may supplement such models with third-party models or use third-party experts to consult with our internal modeling specialists. Both internal and external models are subject to model risk and there can be no assurance that these models are accurate or comprehensive in estimating our liquidity, potential future paid claims, related loss reserves and fair values or that they are similar to methodologies employed by our competitors, counterparties or other market participants. Estimates of our future paid claims, in particular, may materially impact our liquidity position. In addition, changes to our paid claims, loss reserve or fair value models have been made recently and may be warranted in the future. These changes could materially impact our financial results.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not detect or prevent future losses.\nWe assess our risk management policies and procedures on a periodic basis. As a result of such assessment, we may take steps to change our internal risk assessment capabilities and procedures, our portfolio management policies, systems and processes and our policies and procedures for monitoring and assessing the performance of our insured portfolio in changing market conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that these steps will be adequate to avoid future losses. In some cases, losses can be substantial, particularly if a loss occurs on a transaction in which we have a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type principal maturities.\nStrategic Plan Related and Other Risk Factors\nAn inability to maintain high stable insurer financial strength ratings for National or to generate investor demand for our financial guarantees may adversely affect our results of operations and business prospects.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase National\u2019s ratings. Many requirements imposed by the rating agencies in order for our insurance companies to maintain high insurer financial strength ratings are outside of our control, and such requirements may necessitate that we raise additional capital or take other remedial actions in a relatively short time frame in order to achieve or maintain the ratings necessary to attract new business and compete with other financial guarantee insurers and could make the conduct of the business uneconomical. Our inability to raise capital on favorable terms could therefore materially adversely affect our business prospects. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will successfully comply with rating agency requirements, that these requirements or the related models and methodologies will not change or that, even if we comply with these requirements, one or more rating agency will not lower or withdraw its financial strength ratings with respect to any of our insurance companies.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that investor demand for our guarantees will increase regardless of our ratings. Finally, our inability to come into compliance with the rating agency and regulatory single risk limits that National exceeds may also prevent us from writing future new business in the categories of risks that were exceeded, in the case of the regulatory limits, or result in an inability to achieve or maintain our desired ratings, in the case of rating agency limits, and may adversely affect our business prospects, and our failure to come into compliance with these guidelines and rules increases the risk of experiencing a large single loss or series of losses.\nFuture demand for financial guarantee insurance depends on market and other factors that we do not control.\nThe demand for municipal financial guarantee insurance depends upon many factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company. Our ability to attract and compete for financial guarantee business in the municipal market is largely dependent on the financial strength ratings assigned to National by one or more of the major rating agencies. It is also affected by the overall amount of new municipal bonds issued as well as level of interest rates and the spread between insured and uninsured bonds. In addition, the perceived financial strength of other financial guarantee insurers also affects demand for financial guarantee insurance. The impact of the financial crisis on certain participants in the financial guarantee industry may have eroded investors\u2019 confidence in the benefits of bond insurance. We do not expect the demand for municipal financial guarantee insurance to regain its former levels in the near term, if ever.\nWe believe that issuers and investors distinguish among financial guarantors on the basis of various factors, including rating agency assessment, capitalization, size, insured portfolio concentration and financial performance. These distinctions may result in differentials in trading levels for securities insured by particular financial guarantors which, in turn, may provide a competitive advantage to those financial guarantors with better trading characteristics. In addition, various investors may, due to regulatory or internal guidelines, lack additional capacity to purchase securities insured by certain financial guarantors, which may provide a competitive advantage to guarantors with fewer insured obligations outstanding. Differentials in trading values or investor capacity constraints that do not favor us would have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new business at appropriate pricing levels.\nCompetition may have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nNational faces competition from other financial guarantee insurance companies and other forms of credit enhancement, including senior-subordinated structures, credit derivatives, letters of credit and guarantees (for example, mortgage guarantees where pools of mortgage loans secure debt service payments) provided by banks and other financial institutions. We have observed increased competition for business among the active financial guarantors, and opportunities to write new business with attractive returns may be limited. Increased competition, either in terms of price, alternative structures, or the emergence of new providers of credit enhancement, could have an adverse effect on our insurance companies\u2019 business prospects.\nDowngrades of the ratings of securities that we insure may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndividual credits in our insured portfolio (including potential new credits) are assessed a rating agency \u201ccapital charge\u201d based on a variety of factors, including the nature of the credits\u2019 risk types, underlying ratings, tenor and expected and actual performance. In the event of an actual or perceived deterioration in creditworthiness, a reduction in the underlying rating or a change in the rating agency capital methodology, we may be required to hold more capital in reserve against credits in the insured portfolio, regardless of whether losses actually occur, or against potential new business. Significant reductions in underlying ratings of credits in an insured portfolio can produce significant increases in assessed \u201ccapital charges.\u201d There can be no assurance that each of our insurance company\u2019s capital position will be adequate to meet any increased rating agency reserve requirements or that each insurance company will be able to secure additional capital necessary to support increased reserve requirements, especially at a time of actual or perceived deterioration in creditworthiness of new or existing credits. Unless we were able to increase available capital, an increase in capital charges could reduce the amount of capital available to support our ratings and could have an adverse effect on our ability to write new business.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nRegulatory change could adversely affect our businesses, and regulations limit investors\u2019 ability to effect a takeover or business combination that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nThe financial guarantee insurance industry has historically been and will continue to be subject to the direct and indirect effects of governmental regulation, including insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, legal precedents and accounting rules affecting asset-backed and municipal obligations, as well as changes in those laws. These laws limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination without the approval of our insurance regulators, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could expose our insurance companies, their directors or shareholders to fines, the loss of their insurance licenses, and the inability to engage in certain business activity, as the case may be. In addition, future legislative, regulatory or judicial changes could adversely affect National\u2019s ability to pursue business, materially impacting our financial results.\nWhile it is not possible to predict if new laws, regulations or interpretations will be enacted or the impact they would have, any changes to such laws and regulations or the NYSDFS\u2019 interpretation thereof could subject us to further restrictions on the type of business that it is authorized to insure, especially in the structured finance area. Any such restrictions could have a material effect on the amount of premiums that we earn in the future. Additionally, any changes to such laws and regulations could subject our insurance companies to increase reserving and capital requirements or more stringent regulation generally, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and future business. Finally, changes to accounting standards and regulations may require modifications to our accounting methodology, both prospectively and for prior periods; and such changes could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results and/or make it more difficult for investors to understand the economics of our business, and may thus influence the types or volume of business that we may choose to pursue.\nDevelopments in the regulation of derivatives may create additional burdens on the Company.\nMBIA Corp. registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) as a major swap participant and on an ongoing basis is required to comply with the CFTC\u2019s business conduct rules as applied to portfolios in place prior to the enactment of the Dodd Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The CFTC and SEC have promulgated rules to implement this enhanced regulatory framework, including final rules that require the Company to include its legacy insured derivatives in tests used to determine whether it is a major swap participant. Because the CFTC has not yet issued final rules establishing capital requirements for major swap participants, the ultimate impact of such requirements on MBIA Corp. is not yet clear. However, to the extent that MBIA Corp. becomes subject to significant additional capital requirements, it is unlikely that MBIA Corp. will be able to meet those standards. We expect MBIA Corp. to become deregistered as a major swap participant effective as of March 30, 2015. See \u201cInsured Credit Default Swaps\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nInterruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including various financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If these parties do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.\nDespite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to clients or transaction counterparties. We recently reported that information related to a specific group of clients at Cutwater had been inappropriately accessed via the internet. We have concluded our investigation of this incident and confirmed that although certain client information was improperly accessed, there were no unauthorized transactions or client account activity. Moreover, the event did not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nInterruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of clients and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAny impairment in the Company\u2019s future taxable income can materially affect the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.\nThe basis for evaluating the recoverability of a deferred tax asset is the existence of future taxable income of appropriate character. To the extent that the Company\u2019s ability to recognize future taxable income from its existing insurance portfolio through scheduled premium earnings and net investment income becomes impaired, the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets may be materially affected by a corresponding increase to its valuation allowance.\nPrivate litigation claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs further set forth in \u201cNote 21: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in certain litigations, and in the ordinary course of business, may be a defendant in or party to a new or threatened legal action. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend against any current or future action, any adverse ultimate outcome could result in a loss and/or have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent on key executives and the loss of any of these executives, or its inability to retain other key personnel, could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success substantially depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of its senior management and other key employees to implement its business strategy. The Company believes there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which the Company competes. Although the Company is not aware of any planned departures, the Company relies substantially upon the services of Joseph W. Brown, Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain the services of key executives. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key members of the Company\u2019s management team could adversely affect the implementation of its business strategy.\nA different view of the Internal Revenue Service from our current tax treatment of realized losses relating to insured CDS contracts can adversely affect our financial position.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s financial guarantee business, we have insured credit derivative contracts that were entered into by LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC with various financial institutions. We treat these insured derivative contracts as insurance contracts for statutory accounting purposes, which is the basis for computing U.S. federal taxable income. As such, the realized losses in connection with an insured event are considered loss reserve activities for tax purposes. Because the federal income tax treatment of CDS contracts is an unsettled area of tax law, in the event that the Internal Revenue Service has a different view with respect to the tax treatment, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOwnership Change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code can have adverse tax consequences.\nIn connection with transactions in our shares from time to time, we may in the future experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use certain tax attributes, including certain losses, credits, deductions or tax basis, may be limited. Calculating whether a Section 382 ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainties, including the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and limitations on a publicly traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. The Company performs detailed calculations during each quarter to determine if an ownership change has occurred and, based on the Company\u2019s current methodology of calculation, a Section 382 ownership change has not taken place.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\nWe are a holding company and rely to a significant degree on cash flow from our principal operating subsidiaries and access to third party capital. A disruption in the cash flow from our subsidiaries or an inability to access capital could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and ultimately adversely affect liquidity.\nAs a holding company MBIA Inc. is largely dependent on dividends, payments under our tax sharing agreement and advances in the form of intercompany loans from its subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, make capital investments in our subsidiaries and pay dividends, to the extent payable, on our capital stock, among other items. We expect that for the foreseeable future National will be the predominant source of dividends and tax sharing agreement payments. National is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies generally, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that it may pay to us. See \u201cNew York State Dividend Limitations\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 and \u201cNote 14: Insurance Regulations and Dividends\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of dividends.\nWe may also from time to time seek to raise capital from external sources. The Company\u2019s access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of such financing, is dependent on various factors, including (i) the long-term debt ratings of the Company, (ii) expected dividends from our subsidiaries, (iii) the insurance financial strength ratings, financial condition and long-term business prospects of our insurance companies, (iv) the perceptions of the financial strength of our insurance companies and MBIA Inc. and (v) the outcome of our undertakings to collect excess spread and recoveries in connection with ineligible mortgage loans in our insured RMBS securitizations. Our debt ratings are influenced by numerous factors, either in absolute terms or relative to our peer group, such as financial leverage, balance sheet strength, capital structure and earnings trends. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, future growth, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that we are unable to access external capital, our insurance companies may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations, will have less capacity to write business and may not be able to pay dividends to us without experiencing adverse rating agency action. Consequently, our inability to maintain access to capital on favorable terms could have an adverse impact on our ability to pay losses and debt obligations, to pay dividends on our capital stock, to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, to pay our operating expenses and to make capital investments in our subsidiaries. In addition, future capital raises for equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. In addition, some securities that the Company could issue, such as preferred stock or securities issued by the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of its common shares.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and satisfy our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the combined net debt of MBIA Inc.\u2019s corporate segment, which primarily comprised long-term debt, MTNs, investment agreements and derivative liabilities net of cash and investments at amortized cost and a tax receivable from subsidiaries, totaled $740 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The Company expects that MBIA Inc. will generate sufficient cash to satisfy its net debt over time from distributions from its operating subsidiaries or by raising third-party capital, although there can be no assurance that such factors will generate sufficient cash to satisfy its net debt. Our substantial indebtedness and other liabilities could have material consequences, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\na large portion of MBIA Inc.\u2019s financial resources must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions could be limited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our businesses; and\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of our liabilities are at variable rates of interest or denominated in foreign currencies.\nAdverse developments in the credit markets may materially and adversely affect MBIA Inc.\u2019s ability to post collateral and meet other liquidity needs.\nCurrently, the majority of the cash and securities of MBIA Inc. is pledged against investment agreement liabilities, intercompany financing arrangements and derivatives, which limit its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales. If market value or rating eligibility of the assets which are pledged against MBIA Inc.\u2019s obligations were to decline, we would be required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. In such event, we may sell assets, potentially with substantial losses, finance unencumbered assets through intercompany facilities, or use free cash or other assets, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will be available or adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\nChanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial condition and future business.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of MBIA\u2019s investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial condition. In the event that investments must be sold in order to make payments on insured exposures or other liabilities, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Lower interest rates can also result in lower net interest income since a substantial portion of assets are now held in cash and cash equivalents given the increased focus on liquidity. Additionally, in the insurance operations, increasing interest rates could lead to increased credit stress on transactions in our insured portfolio, while a decline in interest rates could result in larger loss reserves on a present value basis.\nWhile we are not currently writing a meaningful amount of new financial guarantee insurance, we expect to do so in the future. Prevailing interest rate levels can affect demand for financial guarantee insurance. Lower interest rates are typically accompanied by narrower spreads between insured and uninsured obligations. The purchase of insurance during periods of relatively narrower interest rate spreads will generally provide lower cost savings to the issuer than during periods of relatively wider spreads. These lower cost savings could be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in demand for financial guarantee insurance. Increased interest rates may decrease attractiveness for issuers to enter into capital markets transactions, resulting in a corresponding decreasing demand for financial guarantee insurance in the future.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk in respect of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In addition to insured liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, some of the remaining liabilities in our corporate segment are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and the assets of our corporate segment are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could substantially increase our potential obligations and statutory capital exposure. Conversely, the Company makes investments denominated in a foreign currency and the weakening of the foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar will diminish the value of such non-U.S. dollar denominated asset. Exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent periods and may continue to do so in the future, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\nIf our insurance companies become subject to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions that require them to maintain qualifying investments to support their reserves and minimum surplus. Furthermore, our insurance companies may be restricted from making commutation or other payments if doing so would cause them to fail to meet such requirements, and the NYSDFS may impose other remedial actions on us as described further below to the extent the Company does not meet such requirements.\nAdditionally, under New York law, the Superintendent of the NYSDFS may apply for an order directing the rehabilitation or liquidation of a domestic insurance company under certain circumstances, including upon the insolvency of the company, if the company has willfully violated its charter or New York law or if the company is found, after examination, to be in such condition that further transaction of business would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors or the public. The Superintendent of the NYSDFS may also suspend an insurer\u2019s license, restrict its license authority, or limit the amount of premiums written in New York if, after a hearing, the Superintendent of the NYSDFS determines that the insurer\u2019s surplus to policyholders is not adequate in relation to its outstanding liabilities or financial needs. If the Superintendent of the NYSDFS were to take any such action, it would likely result in the reduction or elimination of the payment of dividends to MBIA Inc.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain transactions that continue to perform poorly, in particular RMBS transactions that include a substantial number of ineligible mortgage loans, and increased losses or a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain structured finance transactions that remain volatile and could result in additional losses, which could be substantial, including RMBS, CDOs, CMBS pools and CRE transactions. These transactions are also subject to servicer risk, which relates to problems with the transaction servicer (the entity which is responsible for collecting the cash flow from the asset pool) that could affect the servicing and performance of the underlying assets. Furthermore, MBIA Corp. has recorded expected recoveries on second-lien RMBS, and the timing and amount of those recoveries could change. Increased losses or a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect MBIA Corp.\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to RMBS transactions, MBIA Corp. continues to be exposed to risk of losses as a result of poor performance of ineligible loans included in its insured second-lien RMBS transactions, including transactions where it has reached settlements with the sellers/servicers but continues to insure the transactions. Losses in these transactions and in other transactions due to the inclusion of ineligible loans could continue. MBIA Corp. has also recorded significant loss reserves on its first-lien RMBS and CDO exposures, and there can be no assurance that these reserves will be sufficient, in particular if the economy deteriorates.\nWith respect to insured CDS contracts that are backed by structured CMBS pools and CRE CDOs, MBIA Corp. has experienced ratings erosion in the total CMBS collateral underlying its insured static pools. During 2013 and 2014, MBIA Corp. paid claims on a CMBS pool transaction which experienced deterioration such that all of the deductible was eliminated, and we expect to experience additional claims on this transaction in the future. Ultimate loss rates on these transactions remain uncertain. It is possible that MBIA Corp. will experience severe losses or near-term liquidity needs on its insured commercial real estate transactions, in particular if the economy does not continue to improve, there is a new recession, increased delinquencies, higher levels of liquidations of delinquent loans, or higher severities of loss upon liquidation.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Corp. has also recorded significant recoveries related to its second-lien RMBS losses, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of collections. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded expected receipts of $523 million (on a present value basis) from excess spread (the difference between interest inflows on assets and interest outflows on liabilities) in our second-lien RMBS transactions, in reimbursement of our past and future expected claims. Of this amount, $496 million is included in \u201cInsurance loss recoverable\u201d and $27 million is included in \u201cLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The amount of excess spread depends on future interest rates, borrower refinancing and defaults and mortgage insurance payments. There can be no assurance that this recovery will be received in its entirety or in the expected timeframe. In addition, the Company is also pursuing claims related to ineligible loans securitized by Credit Suisse and included in a home equity mortgage trust securitization. The Company\u2019s assessment of the ineligibility of individual mortgage loans has been challenged by Credit Suisse in litigation and there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s determinations will prevail, or that the Company will be successful in collecting its estimated recoveries. The litigation may take several years to resolve, during which time we will be required to pay losses on the subject transaction.\nContinuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured RMBS transactions as well as certain other factors may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if it is not able to pay expected claims.\nAs an insurance company, MBIA Insurance Corporation is particularly sensitive to the risk that it will not have sufficient resources to meet contractual payment obligations when due or to make settlement payments in order to terminate insured exposures to avoid losses. Management\u2019s expected liquidity and capital forecasts for MBIA Insurance Corporation for 2014 reflect adequate resources to pay expected claims. However, there is risk to the liquidity forecast as the Company\u2019s remaining insured exposures are potentially volatile. There are risks to the capital forecast due to those potential liabilities, potential volatility in the collection of excess spread and the remaining put-back recoverable, and potential volatility associated with remaining ABS CDO exposures.\nFurther, the remaining insured portfolio, aside from these exposures, could deteriorate and result in loss reserves and claim payments, including claims on insured exposures that in some cases may require large bullet payments. While management believes MBIA Insurance Corporation will have adequate resources to pay expected claims, if it experiences higher than expected claims payments or is unable collect expected recoveries, it may ultimately have insufficient resources to continue paying claims, which could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. We do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Corp. by NYSDFS would have any significant long-term liquidity impact on MBIA Inc. or result in a liquidation or similar proceeding of MBIA UK. An MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences, such as the loss of control of MBIA Insurance Corporation and the imposition of unplanned expenses.\nRevenues and liquidity would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, MBIA Corp. has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by MBIA Corp. could be reduced in the future due to factors such as not insuring new transactions, early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations, commutation of existing financial guarantee insurance policies or non-payment. Such a reduction would result in lower revenues and reduced liquidity.", "PERMNO": 75175, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "MBI"}
