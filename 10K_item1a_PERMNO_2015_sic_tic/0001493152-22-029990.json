{"cik": "1444307", "company": "ONCOSEC MEDICAL Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-10-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider each of the following risks, together with the other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the risks described below materialize, our business, financial condition, prospects and/or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. These factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, and you could lose all or a substantial part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition or the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur majority stockholders may have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, which may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions.\nAs the date hereof, our two largest shareholders own approximately 51% of the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, these stockholders may exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the appointment of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. This ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination that may be in the best interest of the Company and any other stockholders. This ownership and control may be used to prevent the Company from raising additional funds through the sale of equity which may make it more difficult for the Company to finance its operations.\nWe have never generated, and may never generate, revenue from our operations.\nWe have not generated any revenue from our operations since our inception, and we do not anticipate generating meaningful revenue in the near term. During our fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of approximately $34 million, and from inception through July 31, 2022, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $286 million. We will need significant additional funding to continue our operations and pursue our strategic plans, including continued development of TAVO\u2122-EP. Although we have been and expect to continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, we expect our operating expenses will continue to increase as we further our development activities and pursue FDA approval for one or more of our product candidates.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and planned commercialization efforts, many of which are discussed in these risk factors, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when, or if, we will generate meaningful revenue or become profitable, and it is possible we will never achieve these goals. Our failure to develop our investments in our proprietary technologies and product candidates into revenue-generating operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects and could result in our inability to continue operations.\nWe have limited working capital and a history of losses, which raises substantial doubt as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditor\u2019s report on our financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022, includes an explanatory paragraph related to the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has never generated any cash from its operations and does not expect to generate such cash in the near term. As a result, the Company has suffered recurring losses and requires significant cash resources to execute its business plans. These losses are expected to continue for an extended period of time. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, our ability to generate positive data from our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, the condition of the capital markets and the other risks described in these risk factors. If any one of these factors is unfavorable, we may not be able to obtain additional funding, in which case, our business could be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue our operations or pursue our strategic plans. If we are forced to scale down, limit or cease operations, our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our Company.\nWe do not have adequate cash resources to fund our operations into calendar year 2023 and will need to raise additional capital to continue operating our business. If we are unable to secure additional funds, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts or cease all operations.\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.3 million. We do not generate any cash from our operations. Based on our cash and cash equivalent balance as of July 31, 2022, our Management is of the opinion that without further fundraising or other increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance, we will not have sufficient resources to enable us to continue our operations. Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, should enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. This estimate does not take into account any additional expenditures that may result from any further strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product candidates, including acquisitions of assets, businesses, new product candidates or strategic alliances or collaborations that we may pursue.\nHistorically, we have raised the majority of the funding for our business through offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock. Due to our need for additional funds in the short-term, we are exploring other ways of funding our operations, including debt financings. In addition, we may seek to engage in one or more strategic alternatives, such as a strategic partnership with one or more parties, the licensing, sale or divestiture of some of our assets or the sale of our Company, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into such a transaction or transactions on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIf we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders would experience further dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur debt, our fixed payment obligations, liabilities and leverage relative to our equity capitalization would increase, which could increase the cost of future capital. Further, the terms of any debt securities we issue or borrowings we incur, if available, could impose significant restrictions on our operations, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity or other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and any such debt could be secured by any or all of our assets pledged as collateral. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.\nOur ability to raise additional funds in the short-term will depend on financial, economic and market conditions and the willingness of potential investors or lenders to provide funding, all of which are outside of our control, and we may be unable to raise financing in the short-term, or on terms favorable to us, or at all. Furthermore, high volatility in the capital markets has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on the price of our common stock, and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our clinical development programs and commercialization efforts or cease all operations, and our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our Company.\nIf we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the short-term, we will be unable to fund our operations and may be required to evaluate further alternatives, which could include dissolving and liquidating our assets or seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws. A determination to file for bankruptcy could occur at a time that is earlier than when we would otherwise exhaust our cash resources.\nWe are a clinical-stage company with a limited operating history and no approved products, which makes assessment of our future viability difficult, and may hinder our ability to generate revenue and meet our other objectives.\nWe are a clinical-stage, pre-commercial, company with only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects and how we will respond to competitive, financial or technological challenges. Additionally, although we are investigating licensing and partnering opportunities, no such opportunities have been finalized and, even if completed, we do not expect that these potential opportunities would generate any significant near-term revenue. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing, staffing and financing, applying for patent rights, undertaking clinical trials of TAVO\u2122-EP, and engaging in other research and development activities, including pre-clinical and other clinical studies of our other product candidates. We have not demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate, or conduct the sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, the revenue-generating potential of our business is unproven and uncertain.\nIn addition, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business or our industry. We will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by clinical-stage companies in evolving markets, and we may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Further, errors may be made in predicting and reacting to relevant business or industry trends. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause our business, results of operations, and financial condition to suffer or fail.\nWe are significantly dependent on the success of our ImmunoPulse\u00ae technology platform and our product candidates that utilize this platform, including our lead product candidate TAVO\u2122-EP.\nWe have invested, and we expect to continue to invest, significant efforts and financial resources in the development of product candidates based on our electroporation technology, including primarily our lead product candidate TAVO\u2122-EP. Our ability to generate meaningful revenue, which may not occur for the foreseeable future, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of one or more of these product candidates. However, such regulatory approval and commercialization may never occur. We are working on updated versions of the OMS EP Device to ensure compliance with current regulatory standards as a prerequisite for FDA clearance. We anticipate that we will need to have clinical experience with this device before we seek regulatory approval for our product candidate. If we experience delays in completion of this work or FDA approval in using the updated OMS EP Device in our ongoing clinical trials, it could delay our clinical programs, necessitate enrolling more patients in our ongoing clinical trials, delay the commercialization our product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe success of TAVO\u2122, our OMS EP Device, or any other product candidates based on our electroporation technology will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf our ability to conduct and complete pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including the time, costs and uncertainties associated with all aspects of these studies and trials;\n\u25cf our ability to retain key management and scientific personnel to oversee the approval and adoption of our product candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf the data we obtain from pre-clinical and clinical testing of the product candidates, including data demonstrating the required level of safety and efficacy of the product candidates (for example, a key factor in determining whether we are able to successfully develop and commercialize TAVO\u2122 in melanoma will be the data we obtain from our KEYNOTE-695 trial, which is our ongoing study of TAVO\u2122-EP in combination with Merck\u2019s approved therapy for melanoma in patients who have shown resistance to, or relapse from, certain other cancer therapies);\n\u25cf the regulatory approval pathway we choose to pursue for our product candidates in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals for one or more of our product candidates in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, and the time required to obtain these approvals, if they are ever obtained;\n\u25cf the manufacturing arrangements we are able to establish with third-party manufacturers, both for the manufacture of the product candidates for clinical trial use and for the potential commercial manufacture of products, if and when approved;\n\u25cf our ability to build an infrastructure capable of supporting product sales, marketing and distribution of any approved products in territories where we pursue commercialization directly;\n\u25cf our ability to establish commercial distribution agreements with third-party distributors for any approved products in territories where we do not pursue commercialization directly;\n\u25cf the labeling requirements for any product candidates that are approved, including obtaining sufficiently broad labels that would not unduly restrict our ability to market the product;\n\u25cf acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients and the medical community;\n\u25cf the ability of our products, if and when approved, to effectively compete with other cancer treatments;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile for any product candidates that are approved following such approval;\n\u25cf our level of success in obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf the levels of coverage and reimbursement we are able to secure for any product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u25cf our ability to establish a commercially viable price for our products, if and when approved; and\n\u25cf delays or unanticipated costs, including those related to any of the foregoing.\nIf one or more of these factors is unfavorable, we could experience significant delays or we may not be able to successfully commercialize TAVO\u2122 or any of our other product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates and may fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may present a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates based on our programs. If we do not successfully develop and eventually commercialize products, we will face difficulty in obtaining product revenue in future periods, or may never obtain such revenue, resulting in significant harm to our financial position and adverse effects our share price. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources.\nAdditionally, because we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our estimates regarding the potential market for a product candidate could be inaccurate, and our spending on current and future research and development programs may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Alternatively, we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon or delay our development efforts with respect to a particular product candidate or fail to develop a potentially successful product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIt may be difficult to identify and enroll patients due to clinical trial inclusion-exclusion criteria or other factors, which has in the past, and may in the future, lead to delays in enrollment and in generating clinical data for our trials.\nOur clinical trials have had, and may have in the future, strict inclusion criteria for patient enrollment. These criteria could present significant obstacles to the timely recruitment and enrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients into our trials. We may experience slower than expected patient enrollment in our existing or future clinical trials. Any inability to successfully enroll the number of patients meeting the criteria for any of our clinical trials could cause significant delays in the trial and increase the costs associated with the trial, which could materially harm our business and prospects.\nPatient enrollment in a clinical trial may be affected by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf the design of the study protocol;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for the study;\n\u25cf the perceived risks, benefits and convenience of administration of the product candidate being studied;\n\u25cf the novel 2019 coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d);\n\u25cf the competitive disease space with many trials for patients to select from;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of approved alternate treatments; and\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites to prospective patients.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development or clinical activities. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally. To date, this outbreak has resulted in extended shutdowns of businesses and has had ripple effects on businesses around the world. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are unpredictable. The outbreak may result in additional or more extensive travel restrictions, closures, disruptions of businesses or facilities around the world or lead to social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact our suppliers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 operations. Additionally, variants of the disease present additional uncertainty that could lead to further restrictions that may have a negative impact on our operations and the larger economy.\nGlobal epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could also negatively affect the hospitals and clinical sites in which we conduct any of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted.\nCertain characteristics of our ImmunoPulse\u00ae platform may negatively impact market acceptance of the platform.\nPhysicians, patients, and third-party payors may be less accepting of product candidates based on our ImmunoPulse\u00ae technology platform due to certain characteristics of this platform. For example, these parties may have concerns about the complexity inherent in a combination therapy approach or the clinical application of electroporation technology, which is less prevalent in the U.S. than in certain foreign markets. Moreover, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of any of our technologies and product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. As a result, even if any of our product candidates achieve regulatory approval, a lack of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors and patients of the products or underlying technologies could prevent their successful commercialization and could materially limit our revenue potential.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by the effects of global health epidemics and pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur operational and financial performance have already been affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our clinical trials have experienced delays in patient enrollment, potentially due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, or concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a public health emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the operations of government entities, such as the FDA, as well as contract research organizations, third-party manufacturers, and other third-parties upon whom we rely. As a result of previous \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, many companies, including our own, implemented work-from-home policies for their employees. The effects of these stay-at-home orders and work-from-home policies may have negatively impacted productivity, resulting in delays in our clinical programs and timelines. These and similar disruptions in our operations, ongoing or in the future, could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital, i.e., increases economic uncertainty. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial results, and value of our common stock, it may also affect our ability to access capital and obtain financing, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly, and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, new variants of the virus, or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. Despite the development of effect COVID-19 vaccines and other treatments, we still do not yet know the full impact of potential delays or effects on our business, our clinical trials, our ability to access the capital markets, or supply chains or on the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nIf the commencement or completion of clinical testing for our product candidates is delayed or prevented, we could experience significantly increased costs and our ability to pursue regulatory approval or generate revenue could be delayed or limited.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, unpredictable and difficult to design and implement. Even if we are able to complete our ongoing and currently proposed clinical trials and assuming the results are favorable, clinical trials for product candidates based on our technology are planned to continue for several years and may take significantly longer than expected to complete. Even with the Fast Track designation we received from the FDA for TAVO\u2122-EP in metastatic melanoma in February 2017, additional clinical trials, which can take years to complete, are still required.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan. We do not know and cannot predict whether any of our ongoing or planned trials or studies will be completed on schedule or at all. We also do not know and cannot predict whether any other pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trials to follow completion of our ongoing or any other Phase 2 clinical trials, will be planned or will begin, and in many cases such future trials would be dependent on obtaining favorable results from preceding studies.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed or prevented for many reasons, including due to delays or issues related to:\n\u25cf obtaining clearance or approval from the FDA or a comparable international regulatory body and other applicable agencies, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health, to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and trial sites;\n\u25cf the receipt of flawed or erroneous data from third-party vendors that may include CROs, contractors, clinical trial management experts, or clinical investigators;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board (IRB) and institutional biological committee (IBC), approval to initiate and conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf identifying, recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials, which can pose challenges for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs or approved products for similar indications, requirements for larger than anticipated patient populations, slower than expected enrollment, or higher than predicted rates of patient drop-out or withdrawal;\n\u25cf natural disaster, epidemics, pandemics, political crisis (such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflicts), or other events outside of our control;\n\u25cf retaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but who may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues, death or for any other reason, or who are lost to further follow-up; and\n\u25cf identifying and maintaining a sufficient supply of necessary products or product candidates, including those produced by third parties, on commercially reasonable terms.\nWith respect to any clinical trial we plan, the FDA could determine it is not satisfied with our plan or the details of our clinical trial protocols and designs and could put a clinical hold on the proposed trials, or issue a clinical hold after a trial has commenced. Any such determination could delay the commencement or completion of the trials and would be a setback for the commercialization strategy for the product candidate that is the subject of the trial. Additionally, changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, in which case clinical trial protocols may need to be amended to reflect these changes. Any such amendments could require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs or IBCs for re-examination, which could impact the costs, timing and successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our ongoing, planned or future clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nTo the extent we conduct clinical trials of our product candidates in combination with third parties\u2019 products, we will face additional risks relating to these products.\nTo the extent our commercialization strategy includes the combination of our product candidates with third parties\u2019 products or product candidates, we will likely be required to conduct clinical studies to evaluate the combinations. We have several ongoing and planned combination trials, and these combination studies involve additional risks due to their reliance on circumstances outside our control, such as those relating to the availability and marketability of the third-party product involved in the study. If the marketability of third-party products such as KEYTRUDA\u00ae is impacted, or if we are unable to secure and maintain a sufficient supply of such third-party products when needed on commercially reasonable terms, our clinical studies could be delayed or we could be forced to terminate these studies. Such a delay or termination could have a material negative impact on our development strategy, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, we may need to address any serious safety concerns as part of ongoing or post-marketing surveillance efforts; otherwise we may need to modify, limit or discontinue development efforts related to some of our product candidates.\nEstablishing the safety of a new product is one of the principal objectives of any clinical trial. Adverse events, including serious adverse events, suspected adverse reactions, and unexpected adverse events, and their proper reporting, form the basis of the critical risk-benefit analysis of investigational drug therapies. If adverse events are identified during the development of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidates, we may need to address any serious safety concerns as part of ongoing or post-market surveillance efforts. Alternatively, we may need to modify, limit or discontinue the development of these product candidates to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In the development of new and investigational drug therapies in this industry, many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing have later been associated with adverse events, including serious adverse events that have subsequently prevented further development of the compound. It is not uncommon for adverse events to be encountered during clinical trials. Upon discovery of an adverse event, sponsors are required to investigate this event in order to determine whether there is enough evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.\nIn the event that adverse events, including serious adverse events, suspected adverse reactions, and unexpected adverse events are identified during any of our clinical trials, these trials could be modified, limited, suspended or terminated. Such adverse events may trigger a notification requirement to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, who in turn could order us to cease further clinical investigation or deny approval of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The FDA could also issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve a product candidate. The number of requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased and has resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. Adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidates could also result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, such as a black box warning, or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating market acceptance and revenues from the sale of that product candidate. Adverse events or side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims.\nNo matter how extensive clinical trials and premarket studies may be, the safety profile of a new therapeutic product can only be fully characterized by continuing safety surveillance through a spontaneous adverse event monitoring system and a post-marketing surveillance study. FDA may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. It is well understood in the drug development process that drug safety can never be considered an absolute, since the safety profile of a new therapeutic product will continue to evolve as more information is generated, gathered, and assessed over the course of general use.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by this product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, including specific warnings, black box warnings, adverse reactions, precautions, and/or contraindications;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, and/or require it to be removed from the market;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; or\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any of our product candidates or any future product candidates, or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues, or any revenues, from its sale.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and other studies, and if these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements with third-party CROs to help us manage critical aspects of the clinical trials we sponsor. We rely on these third parties for the execution of certain of our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, and we only control certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations for conducting clinical trials and good clinical practice, as well as the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. We are also required to harmonize standard operating procedures between companies and conduct periodic internal and vendor audits to ensure compliance. Additionally, the FDA and comparable foreign regulators enforce these good clinical practice regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, trial sites, laboratories and other entities involved in the completion of the study protocol and processing of data.\nIf we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable good clinical practice or other regulations, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and/or the FDA or comparable foreign regulators may refuse to accept the data, and these regulators may require us to perform additional or repeat clinical trials, which could significantly increase costs and delay the regulatory approval process. Additionally, repeated compliance failures could prompt the FDA or other regulatory authority to suspend or terminate a clinical trial, which could cause significant approval delays and increased costs. Further, if CROs do not otherwise successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed or terminated or we may not be able to rely on the data produced by the trials.\nMoreover, if any of our relationships with third-party CROs terminate before completion of a clinical trial, we may not be able to establish arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, on a timely basis or at all, which could materially delay or jeopardize the trial. Any such occurrence could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or successfully commercializing our product candidates, which could increase our costs, delay or eliminate our prospects for generating revenue, and otherwise materially harm the results of our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist in the development of product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at or may have previously been, or are currently providing, consulting services to, other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to Management.\nWe have participated in, and continue to participate in, clinical trials conducted under an approved investigator-sponsored investigational new drug (IND) application, and we have little or no control over the conduct or timing of, or FDA communications regarding, these trials.\nWe have engaged sponsor-investigators and continue to engage sponsor-investigators to participate in clinical trials conducted under an approved investigator-sponsored IND application. We also have plans to engage sponsor-investigators in future investigator-sponsored trials under both INDs and Investigational Device Exemptions (\u201cIDEs\u201d), since our product candidates are drug-device combination products. In investigator-initiated trials, the clinical investigator typically designs and implements the study and the investigator or its institution acts as the sponsor of the trial. This sponsor has control over the design, conduct and timing of the trial, and as a result, we have limited or no control over the commencement, conduct and completion of these investigator-initiated trials. In addition, regulations and guidelines imposed by the FDA with respect to INDs and IDEs include a requirement that the sponsor of a clinical trial perform the study in accordance with an approved investigational plan, and provide ongoing communication with the FDA as it pertains to the safety of the drug, device, or treatment being tested. It is the responsibility of the investigator, as the sponsor of the trial, to be the sole point of contact with the FDA for these communications and to exercise all decision-making authority regarding these or other submissions to the FDA about the trial. Consequently, we may have little or no control over the content or timing of these communications, including whether they are timely, accurate or complete. Any failures by the investigator sponsoring these trials could result in reviews, audits, delays or clinical holds by the FDA that could negatively affect the timelines for these trials or jeopardize their completion. As a result, our lack of control over the conduct and timing of, and communications with the FDA regarding, these investigator-sponsored trials expose us to additional risks, many of which are outside of our control and the occurrence of which could severely harm our performance and the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nRegulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates, or any approvals we achieve may be too limited or too late for us to earn meaningful, or any, revenue.\nThe research, testing, and possible eventual manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable regulatory bodies in other countries. These regulatory agencies have the authority to delay approval of or refuse to approve our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the occurrence of adverse reactions or a failure to meet safety and efficacy endpoints in our clinical trials or otherwise to the satisfaction of the regulator, disapproval of our or our partners\u2019 trial design, or disagreement with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials. As a result, even if our product candidates achieve their endpoints in clinical trials, they still may not be approved by any of these regulatory agencies. Moreover, the requirements to obtain product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the FDA\u2019s approval requirements, review procedures and timelines may not be the same as or even similar to the requirements of a comparable foreign regulator. As a result, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in one country, we may be required to undertake additional clinical trials or studies, submit additional information, wait for longer review periods or make other efforts in order to obtain regulatory approvals in other desirable geographic markets, or may not be able to achieve approval in those other desirable geographic markets.\nAlthough we have seen no systemic drug-related adverse events in our trials and studies to date, if we cannot adequately demonstrate through the clinical trial process that a product candidate we are developing is safe and effective, regulatory approval of that product candidate may never be achieved, which could impair our reputation, increase our costs and delay or prevent us from generating revenue. Importantly, success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the required level of efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including many with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in Phase 2, and earlier studies. Further, even if a product candidate is approved, it may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than requested, may include substantial safety warnings or the approval may be subject to the performance of significant post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Any limitation, condition or denial of approval could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial competition we face, even if we are ultimately able to achieve regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, delays in such regulatory approval could delay, limit or prevent our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates if competing products obtain approvals before ours, or with more permissible, or less-restricted, claims and gain market traction against which we are not able to compete. Moreover, we may be forced to reevaluate our development strategies and plans in the face of setbacks or other delays that could jeopardize the value of any regulatory approval that is obtained, which could include abandoning planned clinical trial efforts for a product candidate that we no longer believe has promising value as a commercial product. If we are not able to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals for our product candidates or if we decide or are forced to abandon our efforts to obtain or maintain these approvals, we would have expended significant costs on assets that may never generate any return. Such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our continued viability as a company.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business; even if we comply with such laws and regulations, they may result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material, energy, freight and compliance costs.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. Increased environmental legislation or regulation could also result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials, as well as energy and freight costs. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits.\nThe biotechnology industry is highly competitive, and many of our competitors are significantly larger and more experienced than we are.\nThe biotechnology industry is intensely competitive. This competitive environment stimulates an ongoing and extensive search for technological innovation and necessitates effective and targeted marketing strategies to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and payors in managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and Medicare and Medicaid services.\nWe face competition from a number of sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. We compete against all other developers of cancer treatments, including other immunotherapy treatments as well as other types of treatments for the cancer indications on which we are focused. In particular, a number of companies, some of which are large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, have development strategies similar to our current focus. These companies could include, among others, Bristol Myers-Squibb, Iovance Therapeutics, Syndax, Dynavax Technologies, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals and Idera Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we also compete with other clinical-stage biotechnology companies for funding and support from healthcare and other investors and potential collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical or other companies, as well as for personnel with expertise in our industry. We are smaller, less experienced and less well-funded than many of our competitors, and we have a shorter and less proven operating history and a less recognizable and established brand name than many of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have commercially available products, which provide them with operating revenue and other competitive advantages. Furthermore, recent trends in the biotechnology industry are for large drug companies to acquire smaller outfits and consolidate into a smaller number of very large entities, which further concentrates financial, technical, and market strength and increases competitive pressure in the industry.\nOur competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates more rapidly, or with more or more-extensive claims, than we can or may obtain more robust patent protection or other intellectual property rights to protect their product candidates and technologies, which could limit or prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of one or more of our product candidates, we would face competition from approved products or products under development by larger companies that may address our targeted indications. If we directly compete with these very large entities for the same markets and/or customers, their greater resources, brand recognition, sales and marketing experience and financial strength could prevent us from capturing a share of these markets or customers. Our competitors may also develop products that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed, less costly or more widely accepted for other reasons than any of our products that might obtain regulatory approvals, and our competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing, distributing and otherwise marketing their products.\nWe expect our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. We may not be able to effectively compete in any of these areas, or we may be prevented from being able to compete at all in these areas due to the performance of our products during clinical trials and/or the circumstances of an approval. Presently, we compete with other biotechnology companies for funding and support on the basis of our technology platforms and the potential value of our product candidates based on the factors described above.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur liability if our presentations of information regarding our product candidates are determined, or are perceived, to be inconsistent with regulatory requirements or guidelines.\nThe FDA provides guidelines regarding appropriate presentation of product information and continuing medical and health education activities. Even though we do not have any FDA approved products, these guidelines apply to our current activities with respect to disclosures, presentations or other communications about our product candidates and technologies at healthcare conferences or in other forums. Although we endeavor to follow these guidelines, the FDA, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the Department of Justice could disagree, in which case we could be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, Management\u2019s attention could be diverted and our reputation could be damaged, any of which could materially harm our business and prospects.\nIf we and our contract manufacturers fail to produce our systems and product candidates in the volumes and within the timelines we require, or if they fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could face delays in the development and commercialization of our equipment and product candidates.\nCurrently, we assemble certain components of our OMS EP Device, which is our proprietary delivery mechanism for our TAVO\u2122 product candidate, and we utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture the remaining components of these systems and for the manufacture, testing and storage of all of our supply of our plasmid product candidate for clinical trials or other studies. Except for the facility used to assemble certain components of our electroporation system, we do not own and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial manufacturing capabilities, and we expect to increase our reliance on third-party manufacturers if and when we commercialize any of our product candidates and systems.\nThe manufacture of our systems and product supplies requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the use of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up for commercial production if regulatory approvals are obtained. These difficulties include, among others: problems with production costs and yields; quality control issues, including qualification of the equipment, stability of product candidates and compliance with testing requirements; shortages of qualified personnel; and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. If we or our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or our manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, our ability to provide our electroporation equipment to our partners and product candidates to patients enrolled in our clinical trials, or to commercially launch a product if regulatory approvals are obtained, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs, and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the development program completely.\nIn addition, all manufacturers of our products must comply with current good manufacturing practices, which are regulated by the FDA through its facilities inspection programs. These practices include requirements regarding, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the generation and maintenance of records and documentation. We are required by law to establish adequate oversight and control over raw materials, components and finished products furnished by our third-party manufacturers, but we have limited direct control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Any failure by our manufacturers, including our non-U.S. contract manufacturers, to comply with these requirements could potentially result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, restrictions on imports and exports, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall or withdrawal of product approval. Additionally, if the safety of any product candidate or approved product is compromised due to our or our manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable regulatory requirements or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result of the failure. Any of these factors could cause delays in clinical trials, regulatory submissions or approvals, entail significant costs or hinder our ability to effectively commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, assuming we are successful in receiving approval for and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, if our manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis, pursuant to provided specifications and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and we could lose potential revenue.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber-attacks or system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause material disruptions to our commercialization activities, clinical and other development programs, financial and disclosure controls and other reporting functions and the administrative aspects of our business, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of capital and other resources to remedy. Further, any loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials as a result of such a disruption could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the lost data. Moreover, to the extent any such disruption results in the loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur significant liabilities. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could cause our operations and our performance to suffer.\nWe may be unable to acquire or develop new product candidates or technologies, or we may never be able to commercialize any product candidates or technologies we do successfully acquire or develop.\nAs part of our business strategy, we plan to expand our clinical pipeline and build our portfolio of product candidates through the development, acquisition or licensing of assets or businesses, product candidates or approved products. The process of identifying, planning, negotiating, implementing and integrating an acquisition or license of a new business, product candidate or approved product can be lengthy and complex and can involve numerous difficulties, including difficulties related to:\n\u25cf identifying new potential product candidates or promising technologies;\n\u25cf competing with other companies for the acquisition or license, including many of our competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources;\n\u25cf negotiating the terms of the acquisition or license, at which we have relatively little experience;\n\u25cf accurately judging the value or worth of a potential acquisition or in-license candidate;\n\u25cf paying for an acquisition or license, including the consideration to acquire or license a business, technology or asset (which could include cash and/or issuance of equity or debt securities);\n\u25cf acquisition and integration efforts could disrupt our business and divert the time and attention of Management and other internal personnel from existing operations;\n\u25cf any integration failures could result in the loss or impairment of relationships with employees, consultants, suppliers and other vendors and partners;\n\u25cf exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities based on an acquired company\u2019s operations or assets;\n\u25cf acquisition and integration efforts and costs could reduce available liquidity and other resources to pursue other acquisitions or strategic transactions;\n\u25cf challenges establishing appropriate controls and procedures for any acquisition by us of a private company;\n\u25cf failing to recoup our investment of time, capital and other resources into a proposed acquisition or license, as a result of failing to complete the transaction or, for transactions that are completed, failing to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired or licensed business or asset; and\n\u25cf challenges developing and commercializing any product candidates or technologies that we are successful in acquiring or licensing, which is subject to all of the risks described throughout these risk factors regarding the development of our current product candidates.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, any efforts to acquire or develop new product candidates, technologies or businesses may not produce commercially successful products or otherwise result in meaningful revenue or profitability for our business. As a result, the pursuit of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAny collaboration arrangements we may establish may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may seek collaboration arrangements for the development or commercialization of our current and any future product candidates. To the extent we pursue collaboration arrangements, we would face significant risks in connection with establishing and maintaining the arrangements, including, among others:\n\u25cf we could be subject to intense competition in seeking appropriate collaborators;\n\u25cf collaboration arrangements are complex, costly and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement, and they could require our payment to the collaborator of cash or other consideration, including issuances of equity or debt securities, in order to establish the relationship;\n\u25cf we may be unsuccessful in establishing and implementing any collaboration we desire to pursue, or the terms of the arrangement may not be favorable to us;\n\u25cf collaborations often would require that we relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of the product candidate to the third-party collaborator;\n\u25cf the success of any collaboration arrangements we may establish would depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators, who would likely have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they would apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf disagreements between collaborators regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can be difficult to resolve and can lead to delays in the development process or commercialization of the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the arrangement; and\n\u25cf any termination of a collaboration arrangement that we are able to establish could adversely affect our performance, particularly to the extent we become reliant upon the collaboration for revenue or important commercialization processes or efforts.\nIn addition, collaboration arrangements may also include our pursuit of combination trials to develop and commercialize our product candidates as combination products, such as our KEYNOTE-695 and KEYNOTE-890 studies with Merck\u2019s KEYTRUDA\u00ae. To the extent we continue to pursue these or any other similar collaborative arrangement, we will face certain additional risks and uncertainties in development, as drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, establishing clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors. Additionally, combination products face continued risk and uncertainty post-development in connection with manufacturing and supply regarding the establishment of a reliable commercial supply chain.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks with respect to any collaboration arrangements we pursue or establish could materially adversely affect our performance, financial condition and reputation.\nWe may not be successful in executing our sales and marketing strategy for the commercialization of any of our product candidates, should they be approved, in which case we may not be able to generate significant, or any, revenue.\nIf one or more of our product candidates are approved, our commercialization strategy may include the establishment of our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to market products to our target markets. Developing these capabilities would require significant expenditures on personnel and infrastructure. Moreover, we have no experience with these activities. While we currently expect that any approved products would be marketed for a limited patient population, we might not be able to create an effective sales force to address even a niche market. In addition, some of our product candidates could require, if approved, a large sales force to call on and educate physicians and patients. We could decide in the future to pursue collaborations with one or more pharmaceutical companies to sell, market and distribute any approved products, but we may not be able to establish any such arrangement when desired, on acceptable terms or at all. Further, any such collaboration we do establish may not be effective in generating meaningful revenue to us.\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing the commercialization strategies we have planned. Further, we have not proven our ability to succeed in the biotechnology industry and are not certain that our commercialization strategies, even if implemented as we envision, would lead to significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully implement our commercialization plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of any product candidates that obtain regulatory approval, then we will not generate meaningful, or any, revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf any product candidate that receives regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance, our revenue potential may be limited.\nThe commercial success of any product candidate that obtains marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will depend on the acceptance of these products by physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of adverse effects;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved or other regulator-approved labeling;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf the availability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u25cf any negative publicity related to the product or any competing product;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our or any current or future collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution strategies;\n\u25cf pricing and cost effectiveness;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain adequate third-party payor coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of adequate third-party payor coverage and reimbursement.\nFailures with respect to any one of these factors could severely limit the commercial potential of any product candidate that obtains regulatory approval, which could materially adversely affect our performance and prospects.\nWe may not be able to establish adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for any product candidate that achieves regulatory approvals, which could severely limit our market potential, performance and prospects.\nCost containment has become a significant trend in the U.S. healthcare industry. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for certain products and procedures. Increasingly, third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and treatments and require that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices. In addition, recent trends in U.S. politics suggest that the U.S. healthcare insurance framework may experience significant changes in the near term. For all of these and other reasons, coverage and reimbursement at adequate or commercially viable levels may not be available for any product candidate that achieves regulatory approval. If coverage and reimbursement is not available or is not available at an adequate level for any approved product, the demand for or price of the product could be materially negatively affected, which could severely limit our revenue potential and prospects.\nIn addition, the regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals remains subject to continuing government control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in a particular country, we could be subject to continuing pricing regulations that could delay our commercial launch of the product or negatively impact the revenue potential for the product in that country.\nFuture growth, including growth in international operations, could strain our resources, and if we are unable to manage any growth we may experience, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plans.\nIn late 2016, we established a subsidiary corporation in Australia in preparation for planned clinical trials in that country. In addition, our business plan includes continued growth of our operations, including, among other things, growth in our workforce, expansion of our clinical trial efforts within and outside of the U.S., and expansion of our portfolio of product candidates. This growth could place an additional strain on our Management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, and will require that we incur significant additional costs and hire and train additional personnel to support our expanding operations. Further, we must maintain and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures, which can be more challenging during periods of expansion. As a result, our future success will depend in part on the ability of Management to effectively manage any of this growth we may experience. If we fail to successfully manage any growth we may experience, we may be unable to execute on our business plan.\nIn connection with any geographic expansion we may pursue, international operations would involve substantial additional risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf difficulties complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u25cf difficulties complying with foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data, including the European Union General Data Privacy Regulation, which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data of individuals within the European Union;\n\u25cf difficulties maintaining compliance with the varied and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions that may be applicable to our business, many of which may be unfamiliar to us;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf complexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;\n\u25cf more complexity in our regulatory and accounting compliance;\n\u25cf differing or changing obligations regarding taxes, duties or other fees;\n\u25cf limited intellectual property protection in some jurisdictions;\n\u25cf risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, including vulnerability to appreciation and depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf uncertainty related to developing legal and regulatory systems and standards for economic and business activities in some jurisdictions;\n\u25cf trade restrictions or barriers, including tariffs or other charges and import-export regulations, which are subject to uncertainty, and the trade policies of the current administration regarding existing and proposed trade agreements and the ability to import goods into the U.S.;\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws or policies;\n\u25cf possible failure by us or our distributors to obtain appropriate licenses or regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our product candidates, if approved, in various countries; and\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, economic instability, or the impact of and response to natural disasters, including, but not limited to, the effects of climate change, wars and terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, earthquakes, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could limit our ability to pursue international expansion, increase our costs or expose us to fines or other legal sanctions, any of which could negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to maintain or grow our business.\nIn order to successfully implement and manage our business plans, we depend on, among other things, successfully recruiting and retaining qualified executives, managers, scientists and other employees with relevant experience in life sciences and the biotechnology industry. Competition for qualified individuals is intense, particularly in our industry, due to the many larger and more established life science and biotechnology companies that compete with us for talent. We may also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we heavily rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific, clinical and regulatory advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by others or may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to support us. If we are not able to retain existing personnel, consultants and/or advisors, and find, attract and retain new qualified personnel, consultants and/or advisors on acceptable terms and in a timely manner to coincide with our needs, we may not be able to successfully maintain or grow our operations and our business and prospects could suffer.\nAdditionally, although we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements are terminable by them at will. The loss of the services of any one or more members of our current senior management team could, among other things, disrupt or divert our focus from pursuing our business plans while we seek to recruit other executives, impact the perceptions of our existing and prospective employees, partners and investors regarding our business and prospects, cause us to incur substantial costs in connection with managing transitions and recruiting suitable replacements and, if the departing personnel are crucial to any of our clinical or other development programs, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of the affected product candidates. These risks would be amplified if we are not able to recruit suitable replacements for any departing personnel on acceptable terms and in a timely manner. The occurrence of any of these or other potential consequences could cause significant harm to our business.\nRecent changes in the Company\u2019s executive management team and Board of Directors may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, its business, results of operations and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn June 24, 2021, Daniel J. O\u2019Connor stepped down from his positions as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director of the Company, and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Brian A. Leuthner, formerly Chief Operating Officer, as the Company\u2019s interim Chief Executive Officer. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors commenced a search to recruit a permanent successor with the assistance of an executive search firm. Subsequently, on August 13, 2021, Mr. Brian A. Leuthner stepped down from his role as interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Also on August 13, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors formed a temporary Leadership Committee consisting of three board members, Dr. Margaret Dalesandro, Dr. Yuhang Zhao and Dr. Herbert Kim Lyerly, to lead all development efforts, with a focus on the Company\u2019s lead asset, TAVO\u2122, until a permanent Chief Executive Officer is hired. Subsequently, upon Dr. Dalesandro\u2019s and Dr. Zhao\u2019s resignation from the Board of Directors on December 13, 2021 and December 15, 2021, respectively, the Board of Directors appointed Dr. Linda Shi and Mr. Kevin Smith to serve on the Leadership Committee. On February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the appointment of George Chi, CFA, CPA as the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and on April 28, 2022, approved the appointment of Robert H. Arch, Ph.D., as the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, after which the Leadership Committee was dissolved. Changes in the Company\u2019s executive management team and to the Board of Directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, the Company\u2019s business, and any additional changes to the executive management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to manage and grow its business effectively. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key roles could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nExtensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nBiotechnology companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation relating to the ability to market and sell any drug or medical device. In the U.S., these regulations are principally administered and enforced by the FDA and, to a lesser extent, by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d), and comparable state government agencies, and outside the U.S., these types of regulations are typically administered by various regulatory agencies comparable to the FDA in foreign countries where products or product candidates are researched, tested, manufactured and/or marketed.\nThe Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), the Controlled Substances Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, as well as similar state and foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, design, verification, validation, clinical testing, manufacture, storage, record-keeping, approval, labeling, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, import and export of product candidates such as ours. Under these regulations, we and our contract manufacturers may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, quality control and other procedures, and operations and/or product candidate testing by the FDA, DEA and other authorities during and after the approval process for a product candidate, to confirm compliance with all applicable regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and other applicable requirements. Further, even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained, such approval would, in the U.S. at least, impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, and these limitations could materially limit a product\u2019s market and revenue potential. Additionally, we would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulators with respect to any approved product. Moreover, we could be required to conduct potentially costly post-approval studies or surveillance programs to monitor the effect of any approved products, and the FDA and comparable foreign regulators have the authority to stop or limit further marketing of a product or impose more stringent labeling restrictions based on the results of these post-approval tests and programs or in the event of any unexpected or serious health or safety concern regarding any approved product.\nPossible penalties or other consequences for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements include, among others, observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could force us to modify our clinical programs or other activities; clinical holds on our ongoing clinical programs; adverse publicity from the FDA or others; the FDA\u2019s suspension of its review of pending applications; fines; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution; labeling changes; withdrawal of previously granted product approvals; enforcement actions; restrictions on imports and exports; injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, the regulations, policies and guidance of the FDA or other regulatory agencies could change and new or additional statutes or regulations could be enacted or promulgated. If changes or new laws are more stringent or impose additional, different, or more challenging requirements, our costs of compliance could increase, regulatory approval of our product candidates could be delayed or jeopardized, or post-approval activities for any product candidates that obtain regulatory approval could be further restricted or regulated. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market any of our product candidates, which would materially adversely affect our prospects to generate revenue.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated, constantly evolving and subject to significant change and fluctuation. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that impact our business include, among others:\n\u25cf the laws and regulations administered and enforced by the FDA and other state and federal regulatory agencies, including the FDCA, Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, discussed above;\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration to induce the referral of an individual for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf the federal false claims laws, which generally prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf the Affordable Care Act, which, in general and among other things, expands the government\u2019s investigative and enforcement authority, including requiring pharmaceutical companies to record and disclose to government agencies any transfers of value to doctors and teaching hospitals, and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to the federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute to make it easier to file lawsuits under these statutes;\n\u25cf HIPAA and HITECH, which, in general and among other things, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and impose requirements for the use of standardized electronic transactions with respect to transmission of such information;\n\u25cf the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery laws; and\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of these federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by applicable federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, the healthcare compliance environment is continuously changing at the federal level and with some states mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, registration requirements for sales personnel, spending limits and reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. This shifting regulatory environment, as well as our obligation to comply with different reporting and other compliance requirements, in multiple jurisdictions, including foreign laws and regulations comparable to the U.S. laws and regulations described above, to the extent we continue to pursue operations in foreign countries, such as our clinical activities in Australia, or if we seek to sell any product that obtains regulatory approval in a foreign country, increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of these laws. In addition, these conditions may also adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, the availability of capital, our ability to generate meaningful or any revenue and, if any of our product candidates achieve regulatory approval, our ability to establish a price we believe is fair for the approved product. Further, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights would be applicable to our business, if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval and become commercially available.\nAll of these laws impose penalties or other consequences for non-compliance, some of which may be severe. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, the consequences could include, but are not limited to, fines or other monetary damages, orders forcing us to curtail or restructure our operations, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our strategic plans. Additionally, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert Management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with the various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business could prove costly. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause our performance and financial condition to materially suffer.\nWe are subject to new legislation and regulatory proposals that may affect costs for compliance and adversely affect revenue.\nCongress has closely monitored drug pricing and health care spending in the U.S. Many members of Congress have prioritized policies targeting drug prices and health care spending and are committed to lowering spending in federal government programs. Legislative efforts to reduce health care spending within federal programs may affect overall health care spending in the U.S. The Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act, or PDPRA, which was introduced in Congress in 2019, and again in 2020, proposed to, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and D faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and several changes to how drugs are reimbursed in Medicare Part B. A similar drug pricing bill, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, proposes to enable direct price negotiations by the federal government for certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped based on an international index), requires manufacturers to offer these negotiated prices to other payers, and restricts manufacturers from raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and D. This Act passed in the House of Representatives when it was introduced in 2019, and it has been introduced again in the 2021 term. In September 2021, provisions from this Act were included in budget reconciliation recommendations from several House committees. These recommendations include a provision advanced by the Ways and Means Committee that would limit federal tax credits associated with the clinical study of certain drugs intended for use in certain rare diseases. If passed, this law could increase the costs associated with clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. More recently, on August 16, 2022, President Joseph Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The Inflation Reduction Act, among other things, amends the longstanding \u201cnon-interference\u201d clause under Medicare Part D and now permits the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices with companies for a small number of brand name drugs or biologics without generic or biosimilar competitors starting in 2026 for such products covered under Medicare Pard D and in 2028 for products covered under Medicare Part B. Further, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have also focused heavily on patent and exclusivity reform for prescription drugs. While we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately become law, elements under consideration could significantly change health care spending in which the U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets operate.\nPresident Joseph Biden, like his predecessor, has prioritized drug pricing and price transparency in the health care industry. On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) directing federal agencies to develop and implement policies to lower drug prices. The EO expresses the Biden Administration\u2019s support for a range of drug policy proposals, including Medicare drug pricing negotiation, inflationary rebates, and drug importation from foreign countries, including Canada. Under the previous Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) proposed or enacted several drug pricing measures, including finalization of a regulation that would prohibit rebates from drug manufacturers to payors (referred to as the Rebate Rule). The Rebate Rule\u2019s implementation was delayed by courts, and Congress may prevent its implementation through legislation. Legislative or regulatory changes to the framework of permissible rebates could impact our ability to negotiate with payers to obtain coverage and reimbursement, which may ultimately impact our ability to market our products.\nOn June 24, 2019, President Donald Trump signed an EO directing federal agencies to improve price transparency. Since then, under both the Trump and Biden Administrations, HHS has proposed and implemented regulations to improve price transparency in both provider and payor industries. These transparency measures may shift bargaining power among various stakeholders within the U.S. drug supply chain and could ultimately impact drug pricing and health care costs generally.\nFurther, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), within HHS, has significant regulatory authority to promulgate regulations and impose other compliance requirements that may increase our compliance costs and impact our ability to attain profitability and market our products. CMS sets coverage and reimbursement rates for Medicare and oversees the implementation of Medicaid at the state level. CMS could modify or impose coverage restrictions or modify reimbursement rates on any of our products in a manner that could adversely impact our business. For example, on January 8, 2021, CMS approved Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid section 1115 demonstration application, granting the state the unprecedented ability to implement a closed drug formulary without foregoing the state\u2019s entitlement to rebates under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Implementation of a closed formulary could mean that our products could be excluded from coverage under Medicaid. Further, CMS has implemented regulations that encourage the implementation of value-based payment models for drugs within the Medicaid program. Such payment mechanisms, if implemented, could lead to reduced payment for any of our products.\nWithin CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (\u201cCMMI\u201d), as established by the Affordable Care Act, has broad authority to design, implement, and test new health care payment models that could potentially lower health care spending while maintaining quality or increase quality without increasing spending. CMMI has considered implementing models that could have a significant adverse effect on our business. For example, on November 27, 2020, CMMI finalized a mandatory Medicare Part B drug payment model that would have aligned payment for drugs with international reference prices, entitled the Most Favored Nation (\u201cMFN\u201d) Model. The MFN Model was enjoined by a Federal court on December 28, 2020 for failure to comply with rulemaking procedural requirements. The Biden Administration has withdrawn the MFN Model, but it is unclear whether the Administration will propose and implement the same or a similar model in future rulemaking, and we cannot predict how future regulatory actions by CMMI or any other component of CMS may impact our business.\nIn addition to significant uncertainty with respect to legislation and regulation at the federal level, similar developments by state governments may impact our business. State legislative and regulatory developments could impact drug development, manufacturing, pricing, marketing, distribution, coverage, or payment. Jurisdictional and preemption issues between federal and state laws and regulations are complex and increase the costs of compliance. Further, similar legislative and regulatory uncertainties may arise in foreign drug markets, some of which are heavily regulated. We cannot predict how developments at the state level may impact our business.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them is approved.\nAny product for which we might obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) and good documentation practices) relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, adherence to requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and compliance with requirements regarding company presentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing, studies, and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We also may be subject to certain state laws, including registration requirements covering the marketing, promotion, and distribution of products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u25cf restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling, marketing, or promotion of a product;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf inspectional observations or warning letters from regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u25cf product seizure or detentions;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u25cf adverse publicity.\nIf we or our respective suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our respective collaborators may experience one or more of the actions above, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nEurope has enacted a new data privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, a violation of which could subject us to significant fines.\nIn May 2018, a new privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect across all member states of the European Economic Area. The new regime increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the member states by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data, and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, it increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the member states should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The regime imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenues or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and the failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines.\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third party partners could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards, including those we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately, to comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based off such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives, especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we could incur substantial liability.\nThe clinical use of our product candidates and, if any of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval, any future commercial use of the approved products, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse, or abuse associated with our product candidates or any approved products could result in injury to a patient or even death. In addition, a liability claim could be brought against us even if our product candidates or any approved products merely appear to have caused an injury. These product liability claims could be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others that come into contact with our product candidates or any approved products.\nRegardless of merit or potential outcome, product liability claims against us could result in, among other effects, the inability to continue clinical testing of our product candidates or, for any approved products, commercialization of the products, impairment of our business reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants and distraction of Management\u2019s attention from our primary business activities. In addition, if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities, including liabilities that may be beyond the scope or limits of any applicable insurance policies we may have in place. Any of these outcomes could severely harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to realize value from, or otherwise preserve and utilize, our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising prior to the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds 50% over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. If we experience such an ownership change, our net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations that could reduce, eliminate or defer the utilization of these losses.\nMoreover, the recognition and measurement of net operating loss carryforwards may include estimates and judgments by Management, and the Internal Revenue Service could, upon audit or other investigation, disagree with the amount of net operating loss carryforwards or the determination of whether an ownership change has occurred. Additionally, legislative or regulatory changes or judicial decisions could further negatively impact the ability to use any tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards. Any inability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our U.S. federal or state income tax liability could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technologies, and we may be unsuccessful in these efforts.\nWe believe our success and ability to compete depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product candidates and their respective components and underlying technologies, including devices, formulations, manufacturing methods and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending our intellectual property rights against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using or selling products that infringe on our intellectual property rights depends on the extent to which we have secured and properly safeguarded these rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.\nAlthough we previously owned patents protecting our OMS EP Devices, our primary U.S. and foreign patents providing such protection expired in 2017 and 2018, and the final foreign patents expired in late 2019. As a result, we may have limited ability to enforce these rights against third parties to prevent them from making or selling competing products that rely upon the protected technology, which could harm our competitive position and prospects. In addition to these proprietary rights that expired between 2017 and 2019, we also own or have exclusively licensed certain patents and applications that cover our current clinical methods. These patents/patent applications will expire between 2024 and 2041. These method patents protect the use of a product for a specified method under certain defined parameters. These types of method patents do not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical or similar to the protected product under parameters that are outside the scope of the patented method claims. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote such a product for the indications protected by the method patent, physicians could prescribe the products for these methods on an off-label basis. Although such off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent or prosecute. Furthermore, our licensed patents expiring between 2024 and 2032 may not have as broad a scope as our patents that expired between 2017 and 2019, which in turn may limit our remedies against competitors making and marketing a product that is identical or similar to ours.\nTo the extent our existing patents or pending or planned patent applications expire before we are able to commercialize product depending on the technology or do not otherwise provide sufficient protection, we could be subject to substantially increased competition and our business and ability to commercialize or license our technology or product candidates could be materially adversely affected.\nEven if we secure patents that cover our proprietary technology, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights with patents may prove inadequate. For instance, the breadth of claims in a patent application is often restricted during patent prosecution, resulting in granted claims with a more limited scope than the claims in the original application. Additionally, pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. Laws and regulations for the prosecution of patents are continuously evolving, and the U.S. Supreme Court has, in the past several years, revised certain tests regarding both the grant and review of patents that could make it more difficult to obtain issued patents. Also, any patents that are granted could be subject to post-grant proceedings that could limit their scope or enforceability, and claims that are amended during post-grant proceedings may not be broad enough to provide meaningful protection. Moreover, any patents that are issued to us or any future collaborators may be circumvented or invalidated by third-party efforts, may expire before or shortly after obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, or may not provide sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantage for other reasons. Such challenges could include third-party pre-issuance submissions of prior art to the PTO, or opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter parties review, or post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The cost of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority or validity of the invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Further, obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. These risks may be amplified in some foreign jurisdictions, where patent protection may not be as strong or as effective as it is in the U.S.\nOur reliance on unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, may also pose significant risks. For instance, it can be difficult to protect these rights and they may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost. Although we have taken measures to protect these rights, including establishing confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other third parties, these measures may not sufficiently safeguard our unpatented proprietary rights and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of the confidential information. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such parties, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to secure patent protection for our patentable technologies, if any of our issued patents are limited or found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our patented or unpatented proprietary rights, our business and prospects could be materially negatively affected.\nOur in-licensed intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights and may not prevent competitors from pursuing similar technology.\nIn addition to our owned proprietary rights, we have also exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications that cover our current and future clinical platforms. These patents will expire between 2024 and 2032. These method patents protect the use of a product for a specified method under certain defined parameters. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical or similar to the protected product under parameters that are outside the scope of the patented method claims. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote such a product for the indications protected by the method patent, physicians could prescribe the products for these methods on an off-label basis. Although such off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent or prosecute.\nWe entered into a license agreement with Gaeta Therapeutics in May 2019. Under the license, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to Gaeta Therapeutics\u2019 portfolio of patents and applications covering the combination use of IL-12 protein or DNA and various checkpoint inhibitor therapies, including anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 compounds, in key global markets. Although we do not currently rely on the intellectual property we have licensed from Gaeta, our product candidates could in the future utilize this intellectual property. The in-licensing of this portfolio provides patent protection on our current clinical methods in certain countries until at least 2032 and also gives us the potential to block others utilizing IL-12 in combination with various checkpoint inhibitors, which may not be part of our current clinical platform.\nIf we are not able to maintain our existing in-licenses or if we are not able to establish new in-licenses for any other third-party rights we need, we could become subject to significant costs or royalty or other fees to establish alternative license arrangements, if such licenses are available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, or we could be forced to develop modifications to the affected product candidates or technologies to avoid reliance on the third-party rights, if such modifications are possible. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us and the respective licensing partner regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected. Any inability to secure and maintain adequate rights to any third-party technologies necessary for the development of our product candidates could severely limit our continued research and development activities, our efforts to obtain product approvals and, if such approvals are obtained, our ability to commercialize the approved products, any of which would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.\nWe may become involved in litigation or other proceedings in our efforts to protect our patent and other intellectual property rights, which could require significant time and costs and would be subject to unpredictable outcomes.\nWe may become aware of activities by third parties, including our competitors, that infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property rights. If we choose to file a lawsuit against a potentially infringing third party to try to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, the third party may seek a ruling that the patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced. Such a ruling could severely limit our ability to protect our rights from use by third parties. Further, patent law is a constantly evolving body of law, and changes can affect our rights and our ability to execute on our strategy and our financial results. In the past several years, the U.S. Supreme Court has revised certain tests regarding assessing the validity of patents, which could result in the invalidation of issued patents and/or their claims based on the application of the current patent validity standards. As a result, in the event of any patent infringement litigation or other proceedings involving our patents, our patents could be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope under the current standards. Moreover, even if the validity of our patents is upheld in a patent infringement lawsuit, a court could refuse to stop a third party\u2019s activities on the grounds that the activities do not infringe the specific claims of our patents. Further, even if we were successful in stopping the infringing activity, patent infringement lawsuits are expensive and could consume significant time, Management attention, capital and other resources. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid.\nThese risks of third parties\u2019 infringement of our intellectual property rights may increase if we engage in discussions, collaborations or other strategic arrangements with third parties. Also, new challenges could arise if and to the extent we pursue engagements with third parties located outside the U.S. These factors could increase the risks and costs associated with building and protecting our intellectual property portfolio and could adversely affect our performance and our business prospects. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary information during such discussions, third parties may unintentionally or willfully disclose or convert our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, which could prevent us from pursuing our clinical and other studies and other research and development activities.\nThe validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties has been the subject of substantial litigation in the biotechnology industry. In the course of our research and development activities, we could become subject to legal claims that we, our activities or our product candidates or technologies infringe the rights of others. This type of patent infringement litigation is costly and time-consuming and diverts the attention of Management and technical personnel. In addition, if we or our product candidates or technologies are found to infringe the rights of others, we could lose our ability to continue our development programs or could be forced to pay monetary damages. Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology industry have often settled their disputes by establishing licenses or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, any such licenses may not be available when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. These risks may be amplified due to our small size and limited experience and resources relative to many of our competitors. As a result, any claims of infringement against us, adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could materially delay, hinder or restrict our development efforts or prevent us from continuing to pursue our operational and strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nPublications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nIf we acquire, enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in companies in the future, it could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our Common Stock thereby diluting stockholder value and disrupting our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain a significant ownership stake in other companies. Acquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;\n\u25cf the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;\n\u25cf the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;\n\u25cf with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and\n\u25cf potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or investments, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, we might incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and Management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\nIf we cannot continue to fund our research and development programs, we may be required to reduce product development, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\nOur research and development programs will require substantial additional capital to conduct research, preclinical testing and human studies, establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our research and development activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing and future collaborations and additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress our stock price. If additional funds are required to support our operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy. For example, in October 2022, due to our financial position we made the strategic decision to decrease all clinical activity outside of our melanoma clinical pipeline, including trials and studies involving TNBC and SCCHN.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to extreme volatility, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our Company.\nThe trading volume and market price of our common stock has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant volatility. This volatility could negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital or utilize equity as consideration in any acquisition transactions we may seek to pursue, and could make it more difficult for existing stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock at a price they consider acceptable or at all. This volatility is caused by a variety of factors, including, among the other risks described in these risk factors:\n\u25cf adverse research and development or clinical trial results;\n\u25cf our liquidity and ability to obtain additional capital, including the market\u2019s reaction to any capital-raising transaction we may pursue;\n\u25cf declining working capital to fund operations, or other signs of financial uncertainty;\n\u25cf any negative announcement by the FDA or comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S., including that it has denied any request to approve any of our product candidates for commercialization;\n\u25cf conducting open-ended clinical trials, which could lead to results (either positive or negative) being available to the public prior to a formal announcement;\n\u25cf market assessments of any strategic transaction or collaboration arrangement we may pursue;\n\u25cf potential negative market reaction to the terms or volume of any issuance of shares of our common stock or other securities to new investors pursuant to strategic or capital-raising transactions or to employees, directors or other service providers;\n\u25cf sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold, by stockholders in the public market;\n\u25cf issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts or changed recommendations for our common stock;\n\u25cf significant advances made by competitors that adversely affect our competitive position;\n\u25cf the loss of key management and scientific personnel and the inability to attract and retain additional highly-skilled personnel; and\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions, including factors not directly related to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, such as increased uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare regulatory environment following the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for stock of companies in the life sciences and biotechnology industries in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of specific companies. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our Management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf we issue additional equity securities in the future, our existing stockholders would be diluted.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition to capital-raising activities, on which we have historically relied for cash to fund our operations, other possible business and financial uses for our authorized common stock include, among others, stock splits, acquiring other businesses or assets in exchange for shares of our common stock, issuing shares of our common stock to collaborators in connection with strategic alliances, issuing common stock to vendors for services performed, attracting and retaining employees with equity compensation or other transactions and corporate purposes that our Board of Directors deems to be in the best interest of our Company. Additionally, issuances of common stock could be used for anti-takeover purposes or to delay or prevent changes in control or management of our Company. Any future issuances of our common stock may be consummated on terms that are not favorable, may not enhance stockholder value and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Further, any such issuance will reduce the book value per share of our common stock and reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our existing stockholders.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of your stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future. You should not rely on an investment in our stock if you require dividend income. Further, you will only realize income on an investment in our stock in the event you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares at a price higher than the price you paid for your shares. Such a gain would result only from an increase in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable.\nIf outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock are exercised or outstanding restricted stock units vest and settle, our existing stockholders would be diluted.\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had outstanding (i) options to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock, (ii) warrants to purchase approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, and (iii) approximately 0.06 million restricted stock units. In addition, as of July 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.8 million shares reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive and stock purchase plans. The exercise of options and warrants, the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units or the issuance of additional equity awards under our stock incentive and stock purchase plans could have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock, including the price that any stockholder could obtain for its shares. Further, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the issuance of additional shares of our common stock through the exercise of derivative securities that are currently outstanding or that we may issue in the future.\nSales of common stock by our stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by, or the perceived possibility of sales by, our existing stockholders. Since March 2011, we have completed a number of offerings of our common stock and warrants. Future sales of common stock by significant stockholders, including by those who acquired their shares in our prior equity offerings, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the price of our common stock.\nIf our stock price continues to remain below $1.00 or our stockholders\u2019 equity falls below $2.5 million, our common stock may be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market, which would materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on our market price.\nOn June 2, 2022, we received Notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from Nasdaq that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock has been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, which will continue to trade at this time on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cONCS.\u201d\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until November 29, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by November 29, 2022, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period if the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares ($1 million) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price, and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In that event, we may appeal such delisting determination to a hearings panel.\nWe are currently evaluating our alternatives to resolve the listing deficiency.\nAdditionally, Nasdaq has the authority, pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5550(b)(1), to delist our common stock if our stockholders\u2019 equity falls below $2.5 million. As of July 31, 2022, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $6.1 million. If our stockholders equity falls below $2.5 million, as a result of operating losses or for other reasons, we will fail to meet Nasdaq\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement. We expect that our stockholders\u2019 equity as of October 31, 2022 will fall below Nasdaq\u2019s $2.5 million threshold. If that occurs, or if we are unable to demonstrate to Nasdaq\u2019s satisfaction that we subsequently regained compliance with this requirement, Nasdaq will notify us of such non-compliance. If we receive such notice from Nasdaq, in accordance with Nasdaq rules, we will have 45 calendar days from the date of the notification to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). If our compliance plan is accepted, we may be granted up to 180 calendar days from the date of the initial notification to evidence compliance.\nWe are actively monitoring our stockholders\u2019 equity and will consider any and all options available to us to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance and meet Nasdaq\u2019s minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirements. To the extent that we are unable to maintain compliance, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock, potentially result in even lower bid prices for our common stock, and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing through the sale of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.\nOur results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Continuing concerns over COVID-19, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, including acts of war, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and residential real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence, have precipitated fears of a possible economic recession. Domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil. These events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us. In the event of a continuing market downturn, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may further decline.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and stockholders and the investment community could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business.\nOur Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Although Management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2022, our controls over financial processes and reporting may not continue to be effective, or we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including failures to implement new or improved controls as needed in a timely and effective manner or remediate any significant deficiency or material weakness that is identified in the future, could cause noncompliance with our public reporting obligations, an inability to produce reliable financial reports or material misstatements in our financial statements or other public disclosures. If any of these circumstances were to occur, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other reported information, our reputation could otherwise be harmed, the investment of our stockholders in our company could be negatively affected and the costs to us of raising additional capital could materially increase, any of which could harm our business and prospects.\nMaintaining compliance with our reporting and other obligations as a public company could strain our resources and distract Management.\nAs a public company, we experience significant demands that are not applicable to private companies. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related and other rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market, which maintains the securities exchange on which our common stock is listed for trading, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices, periodic reporting and other disclosure requirements and financial and disclosure controls and procedures. Further, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and make changes to existing regulations that require our compliance, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the corporate governance and executive compensation-related disclosure requirements of this legislation.\nMaintaining compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies involves significant legal, accounting and financial costs. Additionally, if we grow as anticipated, we may need to hire additional personnel and implement new and more sophisticated financial and accounting systems and procedures to continue to meet our public company obligations. Our Management and other personnel devote substantial attention to maintaining our compliance with these obligations, which diverts attention from other aspects of our business. Any failure to comply with these public company requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects and could materially harm our stockholders\u2019 investment in our Company.", "PERMNO": 15380, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ONCS"}
