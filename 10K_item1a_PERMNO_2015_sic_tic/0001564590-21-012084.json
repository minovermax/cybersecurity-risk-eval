See also certain risk factors discussed in Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d In addition to the potential effect of these risk factors, any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses, or reduced liquidity, could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities.\nOperational Risk Factors\nDemand for, and prices of, certain of Kronos\u2019 products are influenced by changing market conditions for its products, which may result in reduced earnings or in operating losses.\nKronos\u2019 sales and profitability are largely dependent on the TiO2 industry. In 2020, 93% of Kronos\u2019 sales were attributable to sales of TiO2. TiO2 is used in many \u201cquality of life\u201d products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local gross domestic product and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic conditions. Such events are likely to cause a decrease in demand for Kronos\u2019 products and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPricing within the global TiO2 industry over the long term is cyclical and changes in economic conditions worldwide can significantly impact Kronos\u2019 earnings and operating cash flows. Historically, the markets for many of Kronos\u2019 products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand. Relative changes in the selling prices for Kronos\u2019 products are one of the main factors that affect the level of its profitability. In periods\n- 17 -\nof increasing demand, Kronos\u2019 selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase, while in periods of decreasing demand Kronos\u2019 selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease. In addition, pricing may affect customer inventory levels as customers may from time to time accelerate purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price increases or defer purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price decreases. Kronos\u2019 ability to further increase capacity without additional investment in greenfield or brownfield capacity may be limited and as a result, Kronos\u2019 profitability may become even more dependent upon the selling prices of its products.\nThe TiO2 industry is concentrated and highly competitive and Kronos faces price pressures in the markets in which it operates, which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses.\nThe global market in which Kronos operates its business is concentrated, with the top five TiO2 producers accounting for approximately 52% of the world\u2019s production capacity, and is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Some of Kronos\u2019 competitors may be able to drive down prices for Kronos\u2019 products if their costs are lower than Kronos\u2019 costs. In addition, some of Kronos\u2019 competitors\u2019 financial, technological and other resources may be greater than its resources and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions. Kronos\u2019 competitors may be able to respond more quickly than it can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Further, consolidation of Kronos\u2019 competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for its products or make it more difficult for Kronos to compete with its competitors. The occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses.\nCompX operates in mature and highly competitive markets, resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs.\nMany of the markets CompX serves are highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar products. CompX focuses its efforts on the middle and high-end segment of the market where it feels that it can compete due to the importance of product design, quality and durability to the customer. However, CompX\u2019s ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses.\n\u2022\nCompetitors may be able to drive down prices for CompX\u2019s products beyond its ability to adjust costs because their costs are lower than CompX, especially products sourced from Asia.\n\u2022\nCompetitors\u2019 financial, technological and other resources may be greater than CompX\u2019s resources, which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions.\n\u2022\nCompetitors may be able to respond more quickly than CompX can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.\n\u2022\nConsolidation of CompX\u2019s competitors or customers in any of the markets in which it competes may result in reduced demand for its products.\n\u2022\nA reduction of CompX\u2019s market share with one or more of its key customers, or a reduction in one or more of its key customers\u2019 market share for their end-use products, may reduce demand for its products.\n\u2022\nNew competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with CompX\u2019s products.\n\u2022\nCompX may not be able to sustain a cost structure that enables it to be competitive.\n\u2022\nCustomers may no longer value CompX\u2019s product design, quality or durability over the lower cost products of its competitors.\nCompX\u2019s development of innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing its sales.\nHistorically, CompX\u2019s ability to provide value-added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of its success. CompX spends a significant amount of time and effort to refine, improve and adapt its existing products for new customers and applications.\n- 18 -\nSince expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the amount of CompX\u2019s research and development expenditures, which is not significant, is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features. The introduction of new product features requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the new product features with current and potential customers. The ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond CompX\u2019s control. While CompX will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer-specific opportunities, we do not know if any new product features it introduces will achieve the same degree of success that it has achieved with its existing products. Introduction of new product features typically requires CompX to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes, including delays, quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials. As CompX attempts to introduce new product features in the future, we do not know if it will be able to increase production volumes without encountering these or other problems, which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nHigher costs or unavailability of CompX\u2019s raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nCertain raw materials used in CompX\u2019s products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world-wide supply and demand as well as speculative investor activity. Zinc and brass are the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of security products. Stainless steel and aluminum are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of marine components. These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources. CompX occasionally enters into short-term raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity-related raw material costs. Materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases.\nCertain components used in CompX\u2019s products are manufactured by foreign suppliers located in China and elsewhere. Global economic and political conditions, including natural disasters, terrorist acts, global conflicts and public health crises such as pandemics, could prevent CompX\u2019s vendors from being able to supply these components. Should CompX\u2019s vendors not be able to meet their supply obligations or should CompX be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials or components, CompX may incur higher supply costs or may be required to reduce production levels, either of which may decrease our liquidity or negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations as CompX may be unable to offset the higher costs with increases in its selling prices or reductions in other operating costs.\nHigher costs or limited availability of Kronos\u2019 raw materials may reduce its earnings and decrease its liquidity. In addition, many of Kronos\u2019 raw material contracts contain fixed quantities it is required to purchase.\nFor Kronos, the number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. For example, titanium-containing feedstocks suitable for use in Kronos\u2019 TiO2 facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world. Political and economic instability in the countries from which Kronos purchases its raw materials could adversely affect their availability. If Kronos\u2019 worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and it were unable to obtain necessary raw materials, Kronos could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels. Kronos experienced increases in its feedstock costs in 2019 and during the first half of 2020, before they moderated in the second half of 2020. Kronos expects its feedstock costs in 2021 to remain relatively consistent with average 2020 costs. Kronos may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect its profitability. Kronos may not always be able to increase its selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce its earnings and decrease its liquidity.\nKronos has long-term supply contracts that provide for its TiO2 feedstock requirements that currently expire through 2023. While Kronos believes it will be able to renew these contracts, there can be no assurance it will be successful in renewing them or in obtaining long-term extensions to them prior to expiration. Kronos\u2019 current agreements (including those entered into through January 2021) require it to purchase certain minimum quantities of feedstock with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $1.2 billion beginning in 2021. In addition, Kronos has other long-term supply and service contracts that provide for various raw materials\n- 19 -\nand services. These agreements require Kronos to purchase certain minimum quantities or services with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $86 million at December 31, 2020. Kronos\u2019 commitments under these contracts could adversely affect our financial results if Kronos significantly reduces its production and was unable to modify the contractual commitments.\nCOVID-19 has affected Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s operations and may continue to affect operations during 2021.\nOur results of operations during 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the second and third quarters, specifically through reduced demand for many of Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s products resulting from the rapid contraction of the global economy. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations will depend on the time period and degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic persists in the global economy, including the timing and extent to which Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s customers\u2019 operations continue to be impacted, their customers\u2019 perception as to when consumer demand for their products will return to pre-pandemic levels and on any future disruptions in their operations or their suppliers\u2019 operations, all of which are difficult to predict.\nCompX has 513 employees and operates three facilities, each of which specializes in certain manufacturing processes and is therefore dependent upon the other facilities to some extent to manufacture finished goods. With the onset of COVID-19, within each facility CompX enhanced cleaning and sanitization procedures, mandated social distancing and implemented other health and safety protocols. CompX is designated an essential business in the states where it operates and is therefore permitted to fully operate during the pandemic, but because the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health and safety of its employees, CompX temporarily closed its Illinois facility for one week in the second quarter. It is possible CompX may have additional temporary closures at one or more of its facilities for the health and safety of its workforce before the end of the pandemic if conditions warrant.\nKronos has 2,242 employees and operates facilities throughout North America and Europe. With the onset of COVID-19, within each facility Kronos enhanced cleaning and sanitization procedures, mandated social distancing and implemented other health and safety protocols. Kronos is also designated an essential business in the countries where it operates and is therefore permitted to fully operate during the pandemic. It is possible Kronos may have temporary closures at one or more of its facilities for the health and safety of its workforce before the end of the pandemic if conditions warrant.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nOur assets consist primarily of investments in our operating subsidiaries and affiliates, and we are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates.\nThe majority of our operating cash flows are generated by our operating subsidiaries and affiliates, and our ability to service liabilities and to pay dividends on our common stock (to the extent such dividends are declared by our board of directors) depends to a large extent upon the cash dividends or other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Our subsidiaries and affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities and they have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay such cash dividends or other distributions to us. In addition, the payment of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates could be subject to restrictions under applicable law, monetary transfer restrictions, currency exchange regulations in jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate or any other restrictions imposed by current or future agreements to which our subsidiaries and affiliates may be a party, including debt instruments. Events beyond our control, including changes in general business and economic conditions, could adversely impact the ability of our subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. If our subsidiaries and affiliates were to become unable to make sufficient cash dividends or other distributions to us, our ability to service our liabilities and to pay dividends on our common stock (if declared) could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our assets consist of ownership interests in our subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were required to liquidate any of such securities in order to generate funds to satisfy our liabilities, we may be required to sell such securities at a time or times at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the actual value of such assets.\n- 20 -\nKronos\u2019 leverage may impair our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Kronos\u2019 total consolidated debt was approximately $487 million, substantially all of which relates to its Senior Secured Notes issued in September 2017. Kronos\u2019 level of debt could have important consequences to its stockholders and creditors, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for Kronos to satisfy its obligations with respect to its liabilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing its vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring that a portion of its cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on its debt, which reduces its ability to use its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends on its common stock, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of Kronos\u2019 subsidiaries to pay dividends to it;\n\u2022\nlimiting Kronos\u2019 ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting Kronos\u2019 flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u2022\nplacing Kronos at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors.\nIndebtedness outstanding under Kronos\u2019 revolving North American credit facility and revolving European credit facility accrues interest at variable rates. To the extent market interest rates rise, the cost of Kronos\u2019 debt could increase, adversely affecting its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to Kronos\u2019 indebtedness, Kronos is party to various lease and other agreements (including feedstock purchase contracts and other long-term supply and service contracts, as discussed above) pursuant to which, along with its indebtedness, Kronos is committed to pay approximately $591 million in 2021. Kronos\u2019 ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on its future ability to generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. In addition, Kronos\u2019 ability to borrow funds under its revolving credit facilities in the future will, in some instances, depend in part on its ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement.\nKronos\u2019 business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable it to pay its debts when they become due and to fund its other liquidity needs. As a result, Kronos may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt before maturity. Kronos may not be able to refinance any of its debt in a timely manner on favorable terms, if at all, in the current credit markets. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance its debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and impact its ability to pay a dividend to us.\nLegal, Compliance and Regulatory Risk Factors\nWe could incur significant costs related to legal and environmental matters.\nWe formerly manufactured lead pigments for use in paint. We and others have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury, property damage and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of lead-based paints. These lawsuits seek recovery under a variety of theories, including public and private nuisance, negligent product design, negligent failure to warn, strict liability, breach of warranty, conspiracy/concert of action, aiding and abetting, enterprise liability, market share or risk contribution liability, intentional tort, fraud and misrepresentation, violations of state consumer protection statutes, supplier negligence and similar claims. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek to impose on the defendants responsibility for lead paint abatement and health concerns associated with the use of lead-based paints, including damages for personal injury, contribution and/or indemnification for medical expenses, medical monitoring expenses and costs for educational programs. We entered into a legal settlement in one public-nuisance lead pigment case and have\n- 21 -\nrecognized a material liability related to the settlement. Any additional liability we might incur in the future for these matters could be material. See also Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings - Lead pigment litigation.\u201d\nCertain properties and facilities used in our former operations are the subject of litigation, administrative proceedings or investigations arising under various environmental laws. These proceedings seek cleanup costs, personal injury or property damages and/or damages for injury to natural resources. Some of these proceedings involve claims for substantial amounts. Environmental obligations are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, and we may incur costs for environmental remediation in the future in excess of amounts currently estimated. Any liability we might incur in the future could be material. See also Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings - Environmental matters and litigation.\u201d\nIf Kronos\u2019 or CompX\u2019s intellectual property were to be declared invalid, or copied by or become known to competitors, or if Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s competitors were to develop similar or superior intellectual property or technology, their ability to compete could be adversely impacted.\nProtection of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks and tradenames, is important to Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s businesses and their competitive positions. Kronos and CompX endeavor to protect their intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which their products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which their products are imported. However, Kronos and CompX may be unable to obtain protection for their intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Although Kronos and CompX have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, they may have to rely on judicial enforcement of their patents and other proprietary rights. Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against Kronos and Compx and their customers and distributors alleging their products infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights.\nAlthough it is the practice of Kronos to enter into confidentiality agreements with its employees and third parties to protect its proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not provide sufficient protection for its trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. Kronos also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of Kronos\u2019 patents or confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in a material loss of its competitive position, which could lead to significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nCompX relies on patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in its technology and designs. Despite these measures, any of CompX\u2019s intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. Others may independently discover CompX\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases CompX could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Further, CompX does not know if any of its pending trademark or patent applications will be approved. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, CompX may be unable to protect its technology and designs adequately against unauthorized third party use, which could adversely affect its competitive position.\nThird parties may claim that CompX or its customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if CompX believes such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and distract management\u2019s and technical staff\u2019s attention and resources. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require CompX to redesign affected technology, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting CompX from marketing or selling certain technology. If CompX cannot or does not license the infringed technology on reasonable pricing terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf Kronos or CompX must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention, and\n- 22 -\nKronos or CompX may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly as it relates to Kronos, may result in increased regulatory scrutiny which could decrease demand for Kronos\u2019 products, increase Kronos\u2019 manufacturing and compliance costs or obligations and result in unanticipated losses which could negatively impact its financial results or limit its ability to operate its business.\nFrom time to time, new environmental, health and safety regulations are passed or proposed in the countries in which Kronos operates or sells its products, seeking to regulate its operations or to restrict, limit or classify TiO2, or its use (such as the classification of TiO2 powder as a suspected carcinogen in the EU). Increased regulatory scrutiny could affect consumer perception of TiO2 or limit the marketability and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2 and increase Kronos\u2019 manufacturing and regulatory compliance obligations and costs. Increased compliance obligations and costs or restrictions on certain TiO2 applications could negatively impact Kronos\u2019 future financial results through increased costs of production, or reduced sales which may decrease its liquidity, operating income and results of operations, which could in turn negatively impact our investment in Kronos.\nGlobal climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s ability to operate their businesses.\nCompX operates production facilities in the United States and Kronos operates production facilities in North America and Europe. Kronos and CompX believe that all of their production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Legislation has been passed, or proposed legislation is being considered, to limit greenhouse gases through various means including emissions permits and/or energy taxes. In several production facilities, Kronos consumes large amounts of energy, primarily electricity and natural gas. To date the climate change legislation in effect has not had a material adverse effect on its financial results. However, if further greenhouse gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries, it could negatively impact Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s future results from operations through increased costs of production, particularly as it relates to energy requirements or the need to obtain emissions permits. If such increased costs of production were to materialize, Kronos and CompX may be unable to pass on price increases to their customers to compensate for increased production costs, which may decrease our liquidity, income from operations and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nTechnology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nKronos and CompX rely on integrated information technology systems to manage, process and analyze data, including to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of their products to and from their plants, receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from their customers and manage payments to vendors. Although Kronos and CompX have systems and procedures in place to protect information technology systems, there can be no assurance that such systems and procedures would be sufficiently effective. Therefore, any of Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s information technology systems may be susceptible to outages, disruptions or destruction as well as cyber security breaches or attacks, resulting in a disruption of their business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or their assets, and/or the inability to access Kronos\u2019 and CompX\u2019s information technology systems. If any of these events were to occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 13303, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "NL"}
