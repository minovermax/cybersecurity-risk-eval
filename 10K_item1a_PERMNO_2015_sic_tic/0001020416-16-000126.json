{"cik": "1020416", "company": "MONSTER WORLDWIDE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe global economic and financial market environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business and operations.\nBecause demand for our services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity, our business has suffered during economic downturns. Many companies hire fewer employees when economic activity is slow. As a result, demand for our services is reduced, which leads to lower sales. If the economy worsens or unemployment increases, demand for our services and our sales may be further reduced. In addition, lower demand for our services may lead to lower prices for our services.\nVolatility in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if the economy worsens, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur markets are highly competitive.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive. They are characterized by pressures to:\n\u2022\nreduce prices;\n\u2022\nincorporate new capabilities and technologies; and\n\u2022\naccelerate hiring timelines.\nFurthermore, we face competition from a number of sources. These sources include:\n\u2022\nother employment-related websites, including large national and international competitors, niche career websites targeted at specific industry verticals, and jobs aggregator websites that aggregate job postings from multiple company websites and job boards;\n\u2022\nprofessional networking and social networking websites;\n\u2022\ngeneral classified advertising websites, some of which offer a low-cost or free alternative to our offerings;\n\u2022\ntraditional media companies, including newspapers;\n\u2022\ncompanies specializing in mobile technologies; and\n\u2022\nInternet portals, search engines and general-interest websites such as blogs.\nIn addition to traditional competitors that provide products and services that are very similar to Monster\u2019s core products and services, we face increasing competition from a broad range of competitor types. Professional networking websites have had significant success over the past several years in gaining large numbers of members and attracting employer customers with products that compete directly with our products. Many niche career websites have been launched targeted at specific industry verticals and many industry blogs and websites now provide employment advertising opportunities for employers within specific industries. Jobs aggregator websites have become a source of competition as they permit job seekers to search multiple\ncompany websites and job boards. Low-cost and free classified advertising websites have also gained increased acceptance with employers. In addition, there are companies specializing in mobile technologies which are garnering the attention of employers.\nSome of our competitors or potential competitors may have greater financial resources, management, technological development, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors have more diversified businesses or may be owned by entities engaged in other lines of business, allowing them to operate their directly competitive operations at lower margins than our operations. In addition, our ability to maintain our existing customers and attract new customers depends to a large degree on the quality of our services and our reputation among our customers and potential customers.\nDue to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our products and services, loss of market share or diminished use of our services by job seekers and our customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.\nWe have no significant proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the online advertising market. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer services and products that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over our services. If we do not keep pace with product and technology advances, there could be a material adverse impact on our competitive position, revenue and prospects for growth. This could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks relating to our foreign operations.\nWe earned 31%, 33% and 34% of our total revenue from continuing operations outside of the United States in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such amounts are generally collected in local currencies. In addition, we generally pay operating expenses in local currencies. Therefore, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the United States dollar. Global foreign exchange markets have experienced periods of heightened volatility in recent years and we cannot predict the direction or magnitude of future currency fluctuations. A weakening of the currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated may lower our results of operations.\nWe are also subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, transactions between our foreign subsidiaries and us may be subject to United States and foreign withholding taxes. Applicable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions differ from those of the United States, and change periodically. The extent, if any, to which we will receive credit in the United States for taxes we pay in foreign jurisdictions will depend upon the application of limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as the provisions of any tax treaties that may exist between the United States and such foreign jurisdictions.\nOur international operations might not succeed or might fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral political uncertainty;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncompetition from local recruiting services;\n\u2022\noperational issues such as longer customer payment cycles and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity;\n\u2022\nlanguage and cultural differences;\n\u2022\ntaxation issues;\n\u2022\ncomplex legal and regulatory requirements that may be uncertain and may change; and\n\u2022\nissues relating to uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the regulation and protection of intellectual property.\nAlso, we could be exposed to fines and penalties under United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, we cannot be sure that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies. Any such violations could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our business and our operating results.\nWe rely on the value of our brands, particularly Monster, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.\nOur success depends on our brands and their value. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to adequately protect our brand names, particularly Monster. We believe that maintaining and expanding the Monster brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and expand our job seeker and employer customer base. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of Internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry. We have spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and maintenance of the Monster brand. We are devoting substantial resources to advertising, marketing and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand. Despite this, we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the Monster brand in a cost-effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed significantly.\nWe also are susceptible to others imitating our products and brands, particularly our Monster brand, and infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, upon which we are dependent. While we believe we have strong trademark protection in the Monster brand worldwide in the careers and recruitment business, that protection does not extend fully to our other businesses. Other companies and organizations use the \u201cMonster\u201d name, and more may do so in the future. This use could adversely affect our brand recognition and reputation if employers or job seekers confuse us with these other organizations. In addition, the laws of foreign countries do not necessarily protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Imitation of our products or brands, particularly our Monster brand, or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise reduce our revenues.\nIf we cannot successfully execute on our \u201cAll the Jobs, All the People\u201d strategy and continue to develop and market products, services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our financial results may suffer.\nThe implementation of our strategy globally is a complex process and relies on leveraging our portfolio of core products to help accelerate the adoption of our new products and services. Success of our future operating results will be dependent upon rapid customer adoption of our new products and services. If our customers are not receptive to our new products and services or our new products and services do not provide the quantity or quality of job candidates that our customers seek, there could be a negative impact on the implementation of our strategy. To successfully execute on this strategy, we need to continue to further evolve the focus of our organization towards the delivery of cost effective and unique solutions for our customers. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of existing customers\u2019 subscription renewals;\n\u2022\nenhancements to existing services;\n\u2022\nthe hiring cycles of employers;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions, such as recessions, that could, among other things, affect recruiting efforts generally and online recruiting efforts in particular;\n\u2022\nthe magnitude and timing of marketing initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance and development of our strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain customers;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet generally or the operation of our products and services specifically; and\n\u2022\nenhancements to technology to safeguard against security breaches.\nWe face risks relating to developing technology.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The emerging character of these products and services and their rapid evolution will require continuous improvement in the performance, features and reliability of our Internet and mobile content, particularly in response to competitive offerings. We may not be successful in responding quickly, cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies or standards (including several different mobile and smart phone operating systems) could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our websites, applications and services. Each manufacturer or distributor of a mobile device or smart phone may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with such devices, we might fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for our products and services. This could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNew Internet services or enhancements that we have offered or may offer in the future may contain design flaws or other defects that could require expensive modifications or result in a loss of customer confidence. Any disruption in Internet access or in the Internet generally could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Slower response times or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our software, hardware or network infrastructure. To the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed.\nTrends that could have a critical impact on our success include:\n\u2022\nrapidly changing technology in online recruiting;\n\u2022\nevolving industry standards relating to online recruiting;\n\u2022\ndevelopments and changes relating to the Internet and mobile devices;\n\u2022\nevolving government regulations;\n\u2022\ncompeting products and services that offer increased functionality;\n\u2022\nchanges in employer and job seeker requirements; and\n\u2022\ncustomer privacy protection concerning transactions conducted over the Internet.\nWe rely heavily on our information systems and if our access to this technology is impaired, or we fail to further develop our technology, our business could be significantly harmed.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage substantial amounts of information, including our employer customer and job seeker databases. To achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our information systems. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our information systems to evolving industry standards and to improve the performance and reliability of our information systems. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through independent consultants, of new proprietary software. Our inability to design, develop, implement and utilize, in a cost-effective manner, information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively could significantly harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nConcerns relating to our compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers, job seekers and other Internet users from using our products and services and subject us to fines.\nConcerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation, which in turn could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, which could potentially have an adverse impact on our business. Moreover, failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, requirements or our policies related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal\ninformation or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of confidence in us by customers, job seekers and other Internet users and could expose us to fines and penalties and could require us to expend significant sums in connection with any failure or perceived failure, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Laws related to data protection continue to evolve. It is possible that certain jurisdictions may enact laws or regulations that impact our ability to offer our products and services and/or result in reduced traffic or contract terminations in those jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling that immediately invalidated the United States-European Union Safe Harbor Framework, a privacy protection mechanism that facilitated personal data transfers to the United States in compliance with the European Commission\u2019s Directive on Data Protection. On February 2, 2016, EU and U.S. officials announced an agreement on a new framework, called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, to replace the Safe Harbor Framework. The exact details of the new EU-U.S. Privacy Shield have not been released, and it has not been formally adopted yet by the European Commission or the U.S. Department of Commerce. As a global company with headquarters in the United States, the operation of our business involves the transfer of EU citizens\u2019 personal information to the United States. While we believe we remain in compliance with EU law regarding the transfer of personal data to the United States, and we believe we will be able to operate our business in accordance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield if it is adopted, there is significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the future of data transfers from the European Union to the United States.\nIntrusions on our systems could damage our business.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. Unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems relating to our customers, job seekers and other website users, and can lead to \u201cphishing\u201d schemes whereby unauthorized persons pose as employers or Monster representatives and seek to obtain personal information from our customers and job seekers. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user\u2019s computer.\nWe have experienced these intrusions in the past. We may also experience these intrusions in the future and may be required to expend significant sums and resources to safeguard against or remediate them. Moreover, negative publicity arising from any intrusion is damaging to our reputation and may adversely impact traffic to our sites. Accordingly, any intrusion could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruptions, delays or failures in the provision of our services could damage our brand and harm our operating results.\nOur systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our systems\u2019 continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Customers, job seekers and other website users may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them, including failures affecting our ability to serve web page requests without significant delay to the viewer. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to customers, job seekers and other Internet users and result in reduced traffic, contract terminations, fee rebates and make goods, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions is damaging to our reputation and may adversely impact traffic to our sites.\nWe do not have multiple site redundancy for all of our services and some of our systems are not fully redundant in the event of any such occurrence. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of a geographical or other disaster impacting our business, we have distributed, and intend to continue assessing the need to distribute, our servers among additional data centers. Failure to execute these changes properly or in a timely manner could result in delays or interruptions to our service, which could result in a loss of users and damage to our brand, and harm our operating results. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.\nWe are vulnerable to intellectual property infringement claims brought against us by others.\nSuccessful intellectual property infringement claims against us could result in monetary liability or a material disruption in the conduct of our business. We cannot be certain that our products, content and brand names do not or will not infringe valid patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We expect that infringement claims in our markets will increase in number. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we were found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party, we could be liable to that party for license fees, royalty payments, lost profits or other damages, and the owner of the intellectual property might be able to obtain injunctive relief to prevent us from using the technology or\nsoftware in the future. If the amounts of these payments were significant or we were prevented from incorporating certain technology or software into our products, our business could be significantly harmed.\nWe may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. As a result, due to the diversion of management time, the expense required to defend against any claim and the potential liability associated with any lawsuit, any significant litigation could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or maintain our rights to use key technologies of third parties, our business may be harmed.\nA degree of uncertainty exists concerning the application and enforcement of trademark, trade dress and copyright laws to the Internet, and existing laws may not provide us adequate protection for our original content or the appearance of our Internet sites. In addition, because copyright laws do not prohibit independent development of similar content, copyright laws may not provide us with any competitive advantage. We have obtained patents and applied for other patents with respect to certain of our software systems, methods and related technologies, but our pending applications may not be granted and any patents issued to us may in the future be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage. We also face risks associated with our trademarks, particularly trademarks covering the Monster brand. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights could involve significant expense and could be difficult or impossible, particularly given the global nature of the Internet and the fact that the laws of certain other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Moreover, certain amendments to the United States patent law made by the America Invents Act of 2011, may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.\nIn addition, we rely on certain technology licensed from third parties, and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in managing our Internet sites and providing related services to users and advertising customers. Our ability to generate fees from Internet commerce may also depend on data encryption, authentication and other technologies that we may be required to license from third parties. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain any of these technology licenses could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks associated with cuts in government spending could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nReductions in government expenditures that have been or may be proposed or mandated could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. Government agencies may be limited in their ability to contract for Monster\u2019s services due to any proposed or mandated spending cuts. In addition, there could be an overall negative impact on economic growth as a result of decreased government spending, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions and entered into alliances and joint ventures in the past and may do so in the future. If we are unable to achieve expected benefits from such transactions, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, growth rates and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy we have entered into agreements relating to acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. Such transactions are inherently risky and can be accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies into our operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with customers and partners of the acquired companies or our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with employees of the acquired companies or our employees as a result of integration of new management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the acquired companies\u2019 accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty regarding foreign laws and regulations and the difficulty integrating operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems and operational differences; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired companies.\nOur failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations generally.\nOur business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, including senior management.\nWe are substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and senior management. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire, motivate and develop talented, highly skilled personnel. Experienced management and technical, marketing and support personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill impairment charges and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or our own operations, and/or other materially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business. In the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to declines in our market capitalization, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $325.8 million in our Careers-North America segment. On a net of tax basis, the charge was $263.0 million after recognizing a tax benefit of $62.8 million. See Note 6-Goodwill and Intangible Assets of the Company\u2019s financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. We may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined which could adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, our goodwill balance was $496.5 million, which represented 43% of total consolidated assets.\nWe estimate tax liabilities, the final determination of which is subject to review by domestic and international taxation authorities.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. We are also subject to review and audit by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to e-Commerce businesses such as Monster and to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-Commerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business models. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nEffects of anti-takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of Monster Worldwide by others.\nSome of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could, together or separately:\n\u2022\ndiscourage potential acquisition proposals;\n\u2022\ndelay or prevent a change in control; and/or\n\u2022\nlimit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.\nIn particular, our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of Preferred Stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our Common Stock, without the consent of the holders of the Common Stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide, among other things, for advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nThere is volatility in our stock price.\nThe market for our Common Stock has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Factors such as announcements of variations in our quarterly financial results and fluctuations in revenue could cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate significantly. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted equity compensation.\nThe market price of our Common Stock can be influenced by stockholders\u2019 expectations about the ability of our business to grow and to achieve certain profitability targets. If our financial performance in a particular quarter does not meet the expectations of our stockholders, it may adversely affect their views concerning our growth potential and future financial performance and, therefore, result in a drop in the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, if the securities analysts who regularly follow our Common Stock lower their ratings of our Common Stock, the market price of our Common Stock is likely to drop significantly.\nWe face risks associated with government regulation.\nThe application of existing laws and regulations to our websites relating to issues such as user privacy, security of data, defamation, advertising, taxation, promotions, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and dampen growth in Internet usage.\nThe federal CAN-SPAM Act and state anti-spam laws impose certain requirements on the use of e-mail. The implications of these laws have not been fully tested. Portions of our business rely on e-mail to communicate with consumers on our behalf and for our customers. We may face risk if our use of e-mail is found to violate the federal law or applicable state law.\nWe post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data on our websites. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or other privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings which could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies as well as various European Union institutions, bodies and agencies regarding privacy issues related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations through a decrease in user registrations and revenues. This could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws. We might unintentionally violate such laws or such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments (or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws) may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nLegal proceedings may significantly harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. It is possible that such litigation or proceedings may significantly harm our future results of operations or financial condition due to expenses we may incur to defend ourselves or the ramifications of an adverse decision.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOn October 22, 2014, the Company consummated an offering of $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.50% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). On October 31, 2014, the Company amended and restated its existing credit facility pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which increased the quarterly amortization payments required with respect to the term loans under our credit facility. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes and the loans and letters of credit under our credit facility, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon any conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, is the subject of recent changes that could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be\nsettled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nFuture conversion of the Notes may limit our ability to utilize our tax attribute carryovers.\nUtilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the United States Internal Revenue Code. If an annual limitation is triggered by an ownership change, it could result in the expiration of carryover attributes before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three year period. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, and (following our receipt of stockholder approval) we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), that conversion of the Notes to shares may contribute to such a cumulative ownership change.", "PERMNO": 84342, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MWW"}
