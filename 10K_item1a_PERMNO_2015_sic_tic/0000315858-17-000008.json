RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our businesses, operations and investments, and general business, economic, financing, legal, regulatory, and other factors and conditions. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors or assess all potential impacts of any factor, or combination of factors, on BBX Capital Corporation or its subsidiaries, including with respect to their operations, results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital relies on dividends from Bluegreen to fund operations.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital has relied and continues to rely primarily on dividends from Bluegreen in order to fund its operations and investments. Dividends from Bluegreen may not be paid to BBX Capital to the extent previously paid or when anticipated or at all. Bluegreen paid dividends totaling $54.4 million during 2015 and $70.0 million during 2016. The payment of dividends by Bluegreen is subject to compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities and certain of Bluegreen's credit facilities contain terms which may limit the payment of cash dividends without the lender's consent or waiver. Decisions with respect to dividends by Bluegreen are generally based on, among other things, Bluegreen's operating results, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity needs. Dividend payments to BBX Capital by any of its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, could, in certain circumstances, be subject to claims made by creditors of such subsidiary.\n\ufeff\nIf cash flow is not sufficient to fund BBX Capital's liquidity needs or BBX Capital otherwise determines it is advisable to do so, BBX Capital might seek to liquidate some of its investments or seek to fund its operations with the proceeds of additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and if BBX Capital chooses to liquidate its investments, it may be forced to do so at depressed prices.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s acquisitions may reduce earnings, require it to obtain additional financing and expose it to additional risks.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s business strategy includes investments in or acquisitions of operating companies, such as its acquisitions of Renin Corp. and the acquisitions of businesses by BBX Sweet Holdings in the candy and confections industry. BBX Capital may also seek to make opportunistic investments outside of its existing portfolio. Some of these investments and acquisitions may be material. While BBX Capital is seeking investments and acquisitions primarily in companies that provide opportunities for growth, it may not be successful in identifying these opportunities. Investments or acquisitions that it completes may not prove to be successful or even if successful may not initially generate income, or may generate income on an irregular basis or over a long time period. Accordingly BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations may vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year. Acquisitions and investments will also expose BBX Capital, or increase BBX Capital\u2019s exposure in the case of acquisitions of or additional investments in its portfolio companies, to the risks of any business acquired or invested in. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in integrating and assimilating acquired management, acquired company founders, and operations;\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with achieving profitability;\n\u00b7\nThe incurrence of significant due diligence expenses relating to acquisitions that are not completed;\n\u00b7\nUnforeseen expenses and losses;\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with entering new markets in which it has no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nThe potential loss of key employees or founders of acquired organizations; and\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with transferred assets and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may not be able to acquire or profitably manage additional businesses, or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses, including Renin and the businesses BBX Sweet Holdings acquired, without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in integrating information systems and personnel and establishing control environment processes across acquired businesses. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that operating businesses are acquired outside the United States or the State of Florida, there will be additional risks\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrelated to compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws, labor laws, currency fluctuations and geographic economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, there is significant competition for investments and acquisitions, which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Substantial costs are incurred in connection with the evaluation of potential acquisition and investment opportunities whether or not the acquisition or investment is ultimately consummated. Further, funding such investments or acquisitions may rely on additional debt or equity financing, which will subject BBX Capital to the risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors. If BBX Capital requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, BBX Capital does not intend to seek shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation or by BBX Capital\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, BBX Capital from time to time may consider transactions involving the sale of its subsidiaries or investments or other transactions which would result in a decrease in BBX Capital\u2019s ownership interest in its subsidiaries, and there is no assurance that any such transactions, if pursued and consummated, will generate a profit or otherwise be advantageous to BBX Capital.\n\ufeff\nWe may issue additional securities and incur additional indebtedness at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may in the future seek to raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities. There is generally no restriction on BBX Capital\u2019s ability to issue debt or equity securities which are pari passu or have a preference over its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Authorized but unissued shares of BBX Capital\u2019s capital stock are available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors, and any such issuance may be dilutive to BBX Capital\u2019s shareholders.\n\ufeff\nFurther, BBX Capital and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future incur significant amounts of debt, including at Bluegreen. Any indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future could have several important effects on BBX Capital or its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, that BBX Capital or its subsidiaries may be required to use available cash for the payment of principal and interest due on its debt and that the outstanding indebtedness and leverage at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries will impact liquidity, and any negative changes in general economic and industry conditions will increase such impact.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s business and operations, including its ability to market VOIs, may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the availability of financing.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s business is subject to risks related to general economic and industry conditions and trends. Bluegreen\u2019s results, operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions, such as high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, declines in real estate values and the occurrence of geopolitical conflicts, including if these or other factors adversely impact the availability of financing for Bluegreen or Bluegreen\u2019s customers or the ability of Bluegreen\u2019s customers\u2019 to otherwise pay amounts owed under notes receivable. Further, adverse changes affecting the vacation ownership industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and other consumer preferences, demographic and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulation of the industry, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business. In addition, Bluegreen's operations and results may be negatively impacted if Bluegreen is unable to update its business strategy over time and from time to time in response to changing economic and industry conditions.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen may be adversely affected by extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations and changes in applicable laws and regulations, including the cost of maintaining compliance with new or existing laws and regulations and the imposition of additional taxes on operations. In addition, results of audits of Bluegreen\u2019s tax returns or those of Bluegreen\u2019s subsidiaries may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which Bluegreen markets and sells VOIs and conducts its other business operations. In addition, many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of VOIs. Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of Bluegreen\u2019s resorts are located, extensively regulate\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe creation and management of timeshare resorts, the marketing and sale of timeshare properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina\u2019s Time Sharing Transaction Procedures Act. Most states also have other laws that are applicable to Bluegreen\u2019s activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws. Bluegreen's management of, and dealings with, POAs, including Bluegreen's purchase of defaulted inventory from POAs in connection with its Secondary Market Sales, is also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen currently is authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which its marketing and sales are conducted. If Bluegreen\u2019s agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew Bluegreen\u2019s licenses, render Bluegreen\u2019s sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on Bluegreen based on past activities.\n\ufeff\nFurther, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of Bluegreen\u2019s business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which Bluegreen provides purchase money financing to the purchasers of its VOIs and conducts its lending and loan servicing operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the federal government and the states and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen conducts business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal government\u2019s national \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list, and the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage rapidly becoming the primary method of communication. The regulations have impacted Bluegreen\u2019s marketing of VOIs, and Bluegreen has taken steps designed to ensure compliance with these new regulations. However, these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase Bluegreen\u2019s marketing costs and may not prevent failures in compliance. Bluegreen cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on Bluegreen\u2019s marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against Bluegreen by individuals claiming that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations.\n\ufeff\nCurrently, most states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective POAs that maintain the related resorts and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, Bluegreen\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, consumers file complaints against Bluegreen in the ordinary course of Bluegreen\u2019s business. Bluegreen could be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding its activities. Bluegreen may not remain in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and violations of applicable laws may have adverse implications on Bluegreen, including negative public relations, potential litigation and regulatory sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations or financial position.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, VOIs may in the future be deemed to be securities under federal or state law and therefore subject to applicable securities regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen due to, among other things, the cost of compliance with such regulations.\n\ufeff\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and Bluegreen may not be able to compete successfully.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell time-share units or VOIs in resort properties. Bluegreen also competes with numerous\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsmaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and also faces competition from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes or apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Bluegreen's ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers' satisfaction with its products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of its products and services from those offered by its competitors. Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at its resorts or otherwise as a member of the Bluegreen Vacation Club, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen's ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries. Bluegreen may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact Bluegreen's operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen would suffer substantial losses and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity position could be adversely impacted if customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations.\n\ufeff\nPrior to December 15, 2008, Bluegreen did not perform credit checks on the purchasers of its VOIs in connection with Bluegreen\u2019s financing of their purchases. Effective December 15, 2008, Bluegreen implemented a FICO\u00ae score-based credit underwriting program. Bluegreen enhanced this credit underwriting program starting in January 2010. While Bluegreen\u2019s loan portfolio originated after December 15, 2008 has to date experienced defaults at a lower rate than loans originated prior to that date, Bluegreen\u2019s FICO\u00ae score-based underwriting standards may not continue to result in decreased default rates or otherwise result in the improved performance of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable. Adverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers\u2019 financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including those outside Bluegreen\u2019s control, may increase the default rates Bluegreen experiences or otherwise negatively impact the performance of its notes receivable. In recent years, external parties have been discouraging certain borrowers from staying current on their note payments. Although in many cases Bluegreen may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit Bluegreen\u2019s ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or Bluegreen may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, Bluegreen has generally not pursued such recourse against its customers. In the case of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable secured by VOIs, if Bluegreen is unable to collect the defaulted amount due, Bluegreen traditionally has terminated the customer\u2019s interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of Bluegreen\u2019s remedy in the event of a default, Bluegreen cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale and such costs generally exceed the cash received by Bluegreen from the buyer at the time of the sale. In addition, Bluegreen will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI. Bluegreen updates its estimate of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods. In addition, defaults may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, Bluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or to result in an increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase and Bluegreen may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to Bluegreen, if at all, which would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s earnings, financial position and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nUnder the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s pledged and receivable sale facilities, Bluegreen may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s securitization transactions require Bluegreen to repurchase or replace loans if Bluegreen breached any of the representations and warranties Bluegreen made at the time Bluegreen sold the receivables. These agreements also often include terms providing that in the event of defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met, substantially all of Bluegreen\u2019s cash flow from its retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold will be required to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from Bluegreen.\n\ufeff\nWhile Bluegreen has attempted to restructure its business to reduce its need for and reliance on financing for liquidity in the short term, there is no assurance that Bluegreen\u2019s business and profitability will not be impacted by its ability to obtain financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with sales of VOIs, Bluegreen may offer financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, Bluegreen incurs selling, marketing and administrative cash expenditures prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs generally exceed the down payment Bluegreen receives at the time of the sale. Accordingly, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to borrow against or sell its notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen\u2019s continued liquidity, and Bluegreen therefore has depended on funds from its credit facilities and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsecuritization transactions to finance its operations. If Bluegreen\u2019s pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and Bluegreen is unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if Bluegreen is unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \u201cwarehouse\u201d facilities on acceptable terms, Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \u201cwarehouse\u201d lines of credit for VOI receivables and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical. While Bluegreen has increased its focus on expanding its fee-based service business and encouraging higher down payments in connection with sales. There is no assurance that these initiatives will enhance Bluegreen\u2019s financial position or otherwise be successful in the long term.\n\ufeff\nNotwithstanding the initiatives implemented by Bluegreen to improve its cash position, Bluegreen anticipates that it will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including funds that Bluegreen obtains pursuant to additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that Bluegreen may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which Bluegreen may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:\n\u00b7\nSupport Bluegreen\u2019s operations and pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nFinance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;\n\u00b7\nFinance a substantial percentage of Bluegreen\u2019s sales; and\n\u00b7\nSatisfy Bluegreen\u2019s debt and other obligations.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to service or refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including its ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on Bluegreen\u2019s future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of Bluegreen\u2019s business, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of Bluegreen\u2019s receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016, Bluegreen had $7.5 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2017. Historically, much of Bluegreen\u2019s debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will in the future be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, or at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of its outstanding debt. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen's indebtedness may impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of Bluegreen's indebtedness may limit its activities.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen's level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on Bluegreen's operations. Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase Bluegreen's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, Bluegreen's leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to Bluegreen's indebtedness require Bluegreen to meet certain financial tests and restrict Bluegreen's ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If Bluegreen fails to comply with the terms of its debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor Bluegreen's compliance with its debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases.\n\ufeff\nTo the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, Bluegreen\u2019s debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to Bluegreen\u2019s variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of $2.8 million, based on December 31, 2016 balances.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.\n\ufeff\nRating agencies from time to time review prior corporate and specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria. In December 2016, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services affirmed Bluegreen\u2019s \u2018B+\u2019 credit rating. Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit rating is also based, in part, on rating agencies\u2019 speculation about Bluegreen\u2019s potential future debt and dividend levels. If rating agencies were to downgrade Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit ratings, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, if rating agencies downgraded their original ratings on certain bond classes in Bluegreen\u2019s securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all. While Bluegreen is not currently aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to its corporate credit rating or the ratings of bond classes in its securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s future success depends on its ability to market its products and services successfully and efficiently and Bluegreen\u2019s marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in the future.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen competes for customers with hotel and resort properties, other vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging options, including private rentals of homes and apartments or condominium units. The identification of sales prospects and leads, and the marketing of Bluegreen\u2019s products and services to them are essential to Bluegreen\u2019s success. Bluegreen incurs expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If Bluegreen\u2019s lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or Bluegreen is unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, Bluegreen may be unable to recover the expense of its marketing programs and systems and its business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, Bluegreen is currently focusing and has increased its marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners and therefore has increased and is expected to continue to increase Bluegreen\u2019s sales and marketing expenses. If Bluegreen is not successful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted. In addition, Bluegreen's marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which Bluegreen has in place and Bluegreen may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes.\n\ufeff\nChanges in new forms of competition, including but not limited to internet marketing models or online applications may impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability for lead generation.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through its arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. If these arrangements do not generate a sufficient number of leads or if these arrangements are terminated or limited and not replaced by other sources of sales prospects and leads, Bluegreen may not be able to successfully market and sell its products and services to new customers at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with its marketing efforts. This would adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen may not be successful in maintaining or expanding its capital-light business relationships, or its capital-light activities, including fee based sales and marketing arrangements, just-in-time VOI arrangements, and Secondary Market Sales activities, and such activities may not be profitable, which may have an adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen offers fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers. Bluegreen has over the last several years continued to expand its capital-light business strategy, which Bluegreen believes enables it to leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. Bluegreen currently intends to continue its focus on its capital-light business activities as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than Bluegreen\u2019s traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen has attempted to structure these activities to cover its costs and generate a profit. Sales of third party developers' VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of their financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due Bluegreen. The third party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet the developer\u2019s requirements, which could impact Bluegreen's ability to sell the developers' inventory. While Bluegreen could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including just-in-time arrangements, where Bluegreen would utilize its receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\notherwise available to Bluegreen and impact profitability. Bluegreen commenced its capital-light activities largely during the recession in response to poor economic conditions and Bluegreen\u2019s fee-based and other capital-light business activities in the future may be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions. While Bluegreen performs fee-based sales and marketing services, Bluegreen sells VOIs in a resort developed by a third party as an interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club. This subjects Bluegreen to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under its own brand name, including litigation risks. Additionally, third party resorts may not meet Bluegreen\u2019s expectations or match the needs of Bluegreen\u2019s owners.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen also sells VOI inventory through Secondary Market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment. In connection with Secondary Market Sales, Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from its resorts\u2019 POAs on a non-committed basis in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from POAs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a discount. While Bluegreen intends to increase its Secondary Market Sales efforts in the future, Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in Bluegreen achieving anticipated results. Further Bluegreen\u2019s Secondary Market Sale activities may subject Bluegreen to negative publicity, which could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s reputation and business.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen does not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if Bluegreen\u2019s customers are not satisfied with the networks in which Bluegreen participates or Bluegreen\u2019s strategic alliances.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen believes that its participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and its Traveler Plus\u2122 program make ownership of Bluegreen VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts. A VOI owner\u2019s participation in the RCI exchange network allows an owner to exchange their annual VOI for occupancy at over 4,300 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. During 2016, approximately 9% of Bluegreen owners utilized the RCI exchange network for an exchange of two or more nights. Bluegreen also has a strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of Bluegreen\u2019s resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Resort Collection\u00ae and Ascend Hotel Collection\u00ae. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus\u2122 members have the ability to convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges\u00ae points which can be used for stays at participating Choice Hotels or may convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points to stay at Ascend Collection\u00ae hotels. Also, all Bluegreen Vacation Club members may convert their Bluegreen Vacation Club points for Choice Privileges\u00ae points for a fee. Bluegreen Vacation Club members, for an additional annual fee, may also participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus\u2122 program which allows them to use their points for a variety of hotel stays, RV site stays within the \u201cCoast to Coast\" network, or various cruise vacations. Also, for a nominal fee, Bluegreen Vacation Club owners who purchased or upgraded their VOI since July 1, 2007 and participate in the Bluegreen Traveler Plus\u2122 program have the ability to use their vacation points to reserve accommodations in 43 additional resort locations through Direct Exchange. Bluegreen may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or Direct Exchange networks in the future. In addition, these networks and Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus\u2122 program may not continue to operate effectively, and Bluegreen\u2019s customers may not be satisfied with them. Further, Bluegreen\u2019s relationship with Choice Hotels may not be well received by Bluegreen\u2019s customers or otherwise result in the benefits Bluegreen expects to derive from the relationship. In addition, Bluegreen may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nBased on Bluegreen\u2019s experience at its resorts and at resorts owned by third parties, Bluegreen believes that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial purchase price of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers and Bluegreen competes with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on Bluegreen\u2019s business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBluegreen is subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.\n\ufeff\nReal estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nLevels of unemployment;\n\u00b7\nLevels of discretionary disposable income;\n\u00b7\nLevels of consumer confidence;\n\u00b7\nThe availability of financing;\n\u00b7\nOverbuilding or decreases in demand;\n\u00b7\nInterest rates; and\n\u00b7\nFederal, state and local taxation methods.\n\ufeff\nA deterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nTo the extent Bluegreen decides to acquire more real estate inventory in the future, the availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices at that time will be critical to Bluegreen\u2019s profitability and the ability to cover its significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If Bluegreen is unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of Bluegreen\u2019s real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction materials and services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of Bluegreen\u2019s future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims of non-compliance with applicable regulations or development-related defects, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nIn the ordinary course of business, Bluegreen is subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes in the litigation and other proceedings to which Bluegreen is or may be subject could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen engages third-party contractors to construct its resorts. Bluegreen also historically engaged third-party contractors to develop the communities within its former Bluegreen Communities business. However, Bluegreen\u2019s customers may assert claims against Bluegreen for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future. Bluegreen could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable. In addition, liabilities related to Bluegreen Communities that were not assumed by Southstar Development Partners, Inc. (\u201cSouthstar\u201d) in connection with Southstar\u2019s purchase of substantially all of the assets which comprised Bluegreen Communities on May 4, 2012, including those relating to Bluegreen Communities\u2019 operations prior to the closing of the transaction, remain Bluegreen\u2019s responsibility.\n\ufeff\nSee \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for a description of currently pending legal matters with respect to Bluegreen. Costs associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental liabilities, including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, could have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, Bluegreen may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including mold, located on, in or emanating from property that Bluegreen owns, leases or operates, as well as related costs of investigation and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproperty damage at such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether Bluegreen knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell or lease its property or to borrow money using such property or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral. Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require Bluegreen to cease or alter operations at one or more of its properties. Further, Bluegreen may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of Bluegreen\u2019s properties.\n\ufeff\nA failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in damage to Bluegreen's reputation and subject Bluegreen to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen's operations and activities require the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of Bluegreen's customers and employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to Bluegreen. If that data is inaccurate or incomplete, Bluegreen could make faulty decisions. Bluegreen's customers and employees also have a high expectation that Bluegreen will adequately protect their personal information. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation are increasingly demanding. Bluegreen's systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data all threaten Bluegreen's information systems and records. Bluegreen's reliance on computer, Internet-based and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to such systems have increased significantly in recent years. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data could adversely impact Bluegreen's reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation and could have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s technology requires updating, the cost involved in updating the technology may be significant, and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair Bluegreen's operations or competitive position.\n\ufeff\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. Bluegreen is currently taking steps to update its information technology platform, which has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and Bluegreen may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which Bluegreen has put in place or expects to put in place in the near term may become outdated requiring new technology, and Bluegreen may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as its competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, Bluegreen may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws related to their real estate activities and the cost of compliance could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses.\n\ufeff\nAs current or previous owners or operators of real property, BBX Capital and its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, may be liable under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. These laws often impose liability whether or not BBX Capital or its subsidiaries knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of investigating, remediating or removing such hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn connection with the sale of BankAtlantic to BB&T during July 2012, BBX Capital acquired nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if these criticized assets are monetized below their current book values.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the BB&T transaction, BBX Capital maintains and manages a portfolio of foreclosed real estate and non-performing loans. As a consequence, BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations will be dependent on its ability to successfully manage and monetize these legacy assets. Further, BBX Capital\u2019s loan portfolio and real estate may not be easily salable in the event BBX Capital decides to liquidate an asset through a sale transaction. If the legacy assets are not monetized at or near the current book values ascribed to them, or if these assets are liquidated for amounts less than book value, BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Because a majority of these legacy assets do not generate income on a regular basis, BBX Capital does not expect to generate significant revenue or income with respect to these assets until such time as an asset is monetized through repayments or it consummates transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate or investments.\n\ufeff\nSome of BBX Capital\u2019s operations are through unconsolidated joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties and we may be adversely impacted by a joint venture partner\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations.\n\ufeff\nBy entering into joint ventures, BBX Capital may be successful in reducing the amount it invests in the ownership and development of real estate properties. However, joint venture partners may become financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreements. Most joint ventures borrow money to help finance their activities, and although recourse on the loans is generally limited to the managing members, joint ventures and their properties, BBX Capital has in some cases and may in the future provide ongoing financial support or guarantees. If joint venture partners do not meet their obligations to the joint venture, BBX Capital may be required to make significant expenditures which may have an adverse effect on its operating results or financial condition. BBX Capital has in the past and may in the future have investments in a number of different joint ventures with the same or related developers which could increase the adverse effects of any failures by such developer to fulfil its obligations.\n\ufeff\nInvestments by BBX Capital\u2019s real estate division in real estate developments directly or through joint ventures expose us to market and economic risks inherent in the real estate construction and development industry.\n\ufeff\nThe real estate construction and development industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous risks which in many cases are beyond management\u2019s control. The success of BBX Capital\u2019s investments in real estate developments is dependent on many factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nDemand for or oversupply of new homes, finished lots, rental apartments and commercial real estate;\n\u00b7\nDemand for commercial real estate tenants;\n\u00b7\nReal estate market values;\n\u00b7\nChanges in capitalization rates impacting real estate values;\n\u00b7\nInventory of foreclosed homes negatively impacting selling prices;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of skilled labor;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of construction materials such as lumber, framing, concrete and other building materials;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws and regulations for new construction and land entitlements, including environmental and zoning laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions increasing costs, delaying construction, causing uninsured losses or reducing demand for new homes;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and cost of mortgage financing for potential purchasers;\n\u00b7\nMortgage loan interest rates;\n\u00b7\nAvailability, delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, approvals or licenses necessary to develop property;\n\u00b7\nConstruction defects and product liability claims and;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nAny of these factors could give rise to delays in the start or completion of a project, or increase the cost of developing a project, or could result in reduced prices and values for BBX Capital\u2019s developments, including developments underlying its joint venture investments.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA significant portion of BBX Capital\u2019s loans and real estate assets are located in Florida and economic conditions in the Florida real estate market could adversely affect BBX Capital\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe legacy assets retained by BBX Capital in the BB&T Transaction and the real estate investments made by BBX Capital are primarily in Florida, and adverse changes to the Florida economy or the real estate market may negatively impact BBX Capital\u2019s earnings and financial condition. BBX Capital\u2019s real estate investment business, the primary source of repayment for loans and the real estate collateralizing loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure or settlements with borrowers and its investments in real estate joint ventures are primarily concentrated in Florida. As a result, BBX Capital is exposed to geographic risks of high unemployment rates, declines in the housing industry and declines in the real estate market in Florida. Adverse changes in laws and regulations in Florida would have a negative impact on BBX Capital\u2019s revenues, financial condition and business. Declines in the Florida housing markets may negatively impact the credit performance of BBX Capital\u2019s loans and result in significant asset impairments. Further, the State of Florida is subject to the risks of natural disasters such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which may disrupt BBX Capital\u2019s operations, adversely impact the ability of its borrowers to timely repay their loans, adversely impact the value of any collateral securing loans and BBX Capital\u2019s portfolio of real estate (both held-for-sale and held-for-investment), or otherwise have an adverse effect on BBX Capital\u2019s results of operations. The severity and impact of tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather related events are unpredictable.\n\ufeff\nRenin sales are concentrated with two significant customers and there is significant competition in the industry.\n\ufeff\nA significant amount of Renin\u2019s sales are to big-box home centers. These home centers in many instances have significant negotiating leverage with their vendors, including Renin, and are able to affect the prices of the products sold and the terms and conditions of conducting business with them. These home centers may also reduce the number of vendors they purchase from or make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for Renin\u2019s products, the loss of a home center customer or reduced sales volume at any of these home centers would have a material adverse effect on Renin\u2019s business. Further, Renin has substantial competition from overseas manufacturers of products similar to those sold by Renin.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical and outside of management\u2019s control.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business in Canada and the United States is dependent on the levels of home improvement activity, including spending on repair and remodeling projects, and new home construction activity. Macroeconomic conditions including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, interest rates, regulatory initiatives, and the availability of home equity loans and mortgage financing affect both discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity. Adverse changes in these factors or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect Renin\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe operating results of Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings would be negatively impacted if they experience increased commodity costs or a limited availability of commodities.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s middle market operating businesses purchase various commodities to manufacture products, including steel, aluminum, glass and mirror in the case of Renin, and sugar and cocoa in the case of BBX Sweet Holdings. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase the cost to manufacture products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase production costs as well as transportation costs, each of which could negatively affect their operating results. Renin\u2019s and BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and the relative negotiating power and resistance of home center customers and big-box retailers to price increases make it difficult to increase selling prices to absorb increased production costs. If Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings are not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve other cost savings or productivity improvements to offset any increased commodity and production costs, BBX Capital\u2019s operating results could be negatively impacted. Many of the raw materials purchased by Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings are sourced from China, Mexico and other countries. Changes in United States trade practices, or taxes levied on these imports, could significantly impact the results of these operating companies.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMarket demand for chocolate and candy products could decline.\n\ufeff\nBBX Sweet Holdings and its acquired businesses operate in highly competitive markets and compete with larger companies that have greater resources. The success of these businesses is impacted by many factors, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nEffective retail execution;\n\u00b7\nEffective and cost efficient advertising campaigns and marketing programs;\n\u00b7\nAdequate supply of commodities at a reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nOversight of product safety;\n\u00b7\nAbility to sell manufactured products at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nResponse to changes in consumer preferences and tastes;\n\u00b7\nChanges in consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and;\n\u00b7\nConcerns related to effects of sugar or other ingredients which may be used to make its products.\n\ufeff\nA decline in market demand for chocolate and candy products could negatively affect operating results.\n\ufeff\nBBX Sweet Holdings may experience product recalls or product liability claims.\n\ufeff\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. BBX Sweet Holdings could decide or be required to destroy inventory, recall products or lose sales in connection with contamination, tampering, adulteration or other deficiencies. These events could result in significant losses and may damage BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 reputation, and discourage consumers from buying products, or cause production and delivery disruptions which would adversely affect BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. BBX Sweet Holdings may also incur losses if products cause injury, illness or death. A significant product liability claim may adversely affect both reputation and profitability, even if the claim is unsuccessful.\n\ufeff\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on information technology (IT) systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties. These IT systems, like those of most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, the Company\u2019s computer systems, like those of most companies, may become subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to cyber or phishing-attacks. Although administrative and technical controls have been implemented which attempt to minimize the risk of cyber incidents, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and any enhanced controls installed might be breached. If the IT systems cease to function properly, the Company could suffer interruptions in its operations. If the cyber-security is breached, unauthorized persons may gain access to the proprietary or confidential information of BBX Capital and its subsidiaries, including information about borrowers, employees or investments. This could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with legally required protocols and to repair or restore the security of its systems.\n\ufeff\nSubstantial sales of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the market prices of such securities.\n\ufeff\nSubstantial sales of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including sales of shares by controlling shareholders and management, could adversely affect the market prices of such securities. Management has in the past and may in the future enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans pursuant to which a significant number of shares are sold into the open market.\n\ufeff\nAlan B. Levan and John E. Abdo's control position may adversely affect the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nAlan B. Levan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital and John E. Abdo, the Vice Chairman of BBX Capital, collectively beneficially own shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 76% of the general voting power of BBX Capital. In addition, each of Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo has been granted restricted securities of BBX Capital which are scheduled to vest over time. Further, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo are parties to an agreement pursuant to which Mr. Alan Levan has\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nagreed to vote his shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock in favor of the election of Mr. Abdo to BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors for so long as he is willing and able to serve as a director of BBX Capital, and Mr. Abdo has agreed to vote the shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock he owns in the same manner that Mr. Alan Levan votes his shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock. Mr. Abdo has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer certain of his shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock and to obtain the consent of Mr. Alan Levan prior to the conversion of certain of his shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock into shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock. Because BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo effectively have the voting power to elect the members of BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors and to control the outcome of any other vote of BBX Capital\u2019s shareholders, except in those limited circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock vote as a separate class. Mr. Alan Levan\u2019s and Mr. Abdo\u2019s control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock. In addition, their interests may conflict with the interests of BBX Capital\u2019s other shareholders.\n\ufeff\nProvisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as BBX Capital's shareholder rights plan, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire BBX Capital and could impact the price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of BBX Capital or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. These provisions include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nThe provisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the special voting rights of BBX Capital 's Class B Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nSubject to the special class voting rights of holders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock under certain circumstances, the authority of BBX Capital's board of directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without additional shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nAdvance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, BBX Capital\u2019s rights agreement, which was adopted and is designed to preserve certain tax benefits available to BBX Capital, may have an anti-takeover effect because the rights agreement provides a deterrent to investors from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nHolders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may not receive dividends in the amounts anticipated, when anticipated, or at all.\n\ufeff\nDuring each of June 2016, September 2016 and December 2016, BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.005 per share on BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. BBX Capital has indicated its intention to declare regular quarterly dividends of $0.005 per share on its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (an aggregate of $0.02 per share annually). However, future dividends are subject to approval and declaration by BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors and, accordingly, BBX Capital may not make dividend payments in the future, whether in the amount anticipated, on a regular basis or as anticipated, or at all. The payment of dividends, if any, by BBX Capital will depend on many factors considered by its board of directors, including, without limitation, BBX Capital\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, and contractual constraints. Further, over time, BBX Capital\u2019s cash needs may change significantly from its current needs, which could affect whether BBX Capital pays dividends and the amount of any dividends it may pay in the future. The terms of BBX Capital\u2019s indebtedness may also restrict it from paying cash dividends on its stock under certain circumstances. In addition, BBX Capital pays regular quarterly cash dividends of $187,500 with respect to its outstanding 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. BBX Capital may not pay or set apart for payment any dividend or other distribution (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in common stock) on its Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends on BBX Capital\u2019s 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared or paid and a sum is set apart sufficient for payment of such accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on BBX Capital\u2019s financial position and operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports BBX Capital files with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the amortization/accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. BBX Capital bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that BBX Capital believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are often not readily apparent from other sources. However, estimates, judgments and assumptions are subject to change in the future, and BBX Capital's estimates, judgments and assumptions may prove to be incorrect and BBX Capital's actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, or BBX Capital\u2019s actual results differ from BBX Capital's estimates or assumptions, BBX Capital may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges, which would be recorded as a charge against its earnings and could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s goodwill was tested for impairment on December 31, 2016 (annual testing date) and the goodwill assigned to one of BBX Sweet Holdings reporting units was determined to be impaired. The goodwill assigned to another BBX Sweet Holdings reporting unit was determined not to be impaired. If BBX Sweet Holdings\u2019 reporting units do not meet expectations or if there is a downturn in the sugar and confectionery industry, the Company may recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\n\ufeff\nUnexpected events, such as natural disasters, severe weather and terrorist activities may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and increase our costs.\n\ufeff\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather or terrorist activities in countries or regions in which our assets, suppliers or our operating businesses are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\ufeff\nNatural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, or other unexpected events could result in temporary or long-term disruption in the delivery or supply of necessary raw materials and component products from suppliers, which would disrupt production capabilities and likely increase our cost of doing business.\n\ufeff\nLegal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact BBX Capital and its financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings. The impact of any funding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results and the costs of defending pending or threatened legal proceedings could be significant.\n\ufeff\nThe loss of the services of key management and personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on the ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. If the Company is unable to retain and motivate its existing employees and efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 89735, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BBX"}
