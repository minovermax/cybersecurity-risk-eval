You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Below please find a summary of the principal risks we face. These risks are discussed more fully below.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and are expected to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to identify or execute on any strategic alternatives.\n\u2022\nWe will need additional capital to continue product development and may not be able to do so. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate product development programs.\n\u2022\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing arrangements may cause dilution to stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\n\u2022\nWe have no history of obtaining regulatory approval or commercialization of pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s prospects.\n\u2022\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies.\n\u2022\nCB 2782-PEG and CB 4332, are in the early stages of development and their commercial viability remains subject to current and future preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and the risks generally inherent in the development of a pharmaceutical product candidate. If we are unable to successfully advance or develop our complement product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\n\u2022\nCB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 and all of our other product candidates will require additional clinical testing before they can be sold.\n\u2022\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the commencement of clinical trials or patient enrollment in clinical trials, our regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n\u2022\nThe operations of our third-party manufacturers may be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by U.S. or foreign government orders such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\n\u2022\nThe coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may impact our third-party supply of the raw materials and components needed for our product candidates, which increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of such product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development efforts.\n\u2022\nOur complement product candidates may cause the generation of neutralizing antibodies, which could prevent their further development.\n\u2022\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\u2022\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to build a pipeline of additional product candidates.\n\u2022\nResults from preclinical or early stage clinical trials may not be confirmed in later trials, and if serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nFast Track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\n\u2022\nBreakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for any product candidate may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval.\n\u2022\nWe expect to seek to establish additional collaborations, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\n\u2022\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical testing and expect to continue to do so for clinical testing and commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities or quality of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates and any future products.\n\u2022\nWe and our contract manufacturers will be subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products. The manufacturing facilities on which we will rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and any clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such tasks or trials.\n\u2022\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\n\u2022\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\n\u2022\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\n\u2022\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\n\u2022\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\n\u2022\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\n\u2022\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\n\u2022\nThe FDA may disagree with our regulatory plan and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\n\u2022\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to evolving privacy and data protection laws, including HIPAA and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). If we fail to protect personal information or comply with existing or future data protection regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of our product candidates harms patients or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\n\u2022\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and share price.\n\u2022\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n\u2022\nOur product candidates are years away from regulatory approval.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved.\n\u2022\nWe face substantial competition that may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\n\u2022\nEven if we commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that would harm our business.\n\u2022\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\n\u2022\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than expected, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile.\n\u2022\nFluctuations in operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management.\n\u2022\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\n\u2022\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nRisks related to our financial condition and capital requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and are expected to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a preclinical-stage biotechnology company, and we have not yet generated significant revenues. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in August 2002, including net losses of $87.9 million and $56.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $402.7 million.\nWe are still in the early stages of development of our product candidates, and have no products approved for commercial sale. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through issuances of shares of common stock, from private placements of convertible preferred stock, and from payments under collaboration agreements.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our preclinical and clinical development activities. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our complement product candidates. Our operating losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We are expected to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years as we:\n\u2022\ncontinue preclinical development and begin clinical development of CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 and our other complement product candidates;\n\u2022\ncontinue having CB 4332 and our other complement product candidates manufactured for preclinical and clinical development;\n\u2022\nfurther develop the manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nattract, hire and retain skilled personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies\u037e\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies\u037e\n\u2022\nmaintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio\u037e\n\u2022\ncreate additional infrastructure to support operations as a public company and our product development and planned future commercialization efforts\u037e and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or other issues with any of the above.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which regulatory approval is obtained. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain research and development efforts, diversify product offerings or even continue operations. A decline in the value of our common stock could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may not be able to identify or execute any strategic alternatives.\nIn February 2022 we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all.\nWe will need additional capital to continue product development and may not be able to do so. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate product development programs.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. If we continue with preclinical and clinical development activities, we will continue to incur expenses related to the preclinical and clinical development of our complement product candidates. We believe that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we expect to need to raise substantial additional capital to begin the clinical development of CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 or any of our other complement product candidates, and depending on the availability of capital, may need to delay or cease development of some or all of our product candidates. Even if we raise additional capital, we may elect to focus our efforts on one or more development programs and delay or cease other development programs.\nUntil we can generate sufficient revenue from our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations and/or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs.\nBecause successful development of our product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe costs and results of preclinical studies or clinical trials of CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 or our other complement product candidates, and expenses related to potential clinical development of such candidates;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022\nthe costs we incur related to our cessation of development of MarzAA and DalcA;\n\u2022\nthe costs we incur to purchase CB 2782-PEG inventory from Biogen;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\nour headcount and costs associated with hiring or retaining personnel;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patent rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of completing outsourced manufacturing activities;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of continuing to operate our business, including costs associated with being a public company; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire, license or invest in businesses, products or technologies.\nWe will require additional capital to achieve our business objectives. Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Further, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our strategy.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing arrangements may cause dilution to stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. We currently have in place an Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler & Co. that permits us, subject to applicable SEC regulations, up to $50.0 million worth of shares of our common stock in \u201cat the market\u201d transactions at prevailing market prices.\nDebt financing, if available at all, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We may also seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding if, and when necessary. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we could be required to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more, or all, of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe currently have an effective registration statement on Form S-3 that allows us to offer up to $150.0 million of securities in one or more offerings, subject to limitations under applicable SEC rules, including up to $50.0 million of common stock issuable under our Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler & Co. Any additional sales in the public market of our common stock or other securities under these shelf registration statements could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe have no history of obtaining regulatory approval or commercialization of pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s prospects.\nWe began operations in August 2002. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing the Company, developing our technology and product candidates, establishing collaborations and conducting Phase 2 clinical trials on small numbers of patients. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a product at commercial scale repeatedly, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, predictions about the Company\u2019s future product development timelines, clinical trial plans, expenses, success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nRisks related to our business operations and product candidates\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies.\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has resulted in widespread requirements for individuals to work from their homes, strained medical facilities worldwide and is causing disruptions to certain pharmaceutical manufacturing and product supply chains. We are experiencing operational and other challenges as a result of the COVID-19 global\npandemic across our programs. The impact of COVID-19 on the enrollment of the MAA-304 and MAA-202 studies contributed to their being halted in November 2021, and may delay or halt our development in other programs. In particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies, drug manufacturing and clinical trials including:\n\u2022\ndelays in manufacturing of our product candidates as third-party manufacturing capacity is shifted towards the production of COVID-19 vaccines;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, European Medicines Agency (the \u201cEMA\u201d) or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines;\n\u2022\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022\nmaterial delays and complications with respect to our research and development programs.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our operations and the value of our common stock.\nCB 2782-PEG and CB 4332 are in the early stages of development and their commercial viability remains subject to current and future preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and the risks generally inherent in the development of a pharmaceutical product candidate. If we are unable to successfully advance or develop our complement product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe currently have no products approved for commercial sale, and all of our product candidates are currently in clinical and preclinical development. To date, we have not successfully commercially marketed, distributed or sold any product candidate. The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to successfully advance the development of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials, have the product candidates approved for sale by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries, and ultimately have the product candidates successfully commercialized by us or a strategic partner. We cannot assure you that the results of our ongoing preclinical studies or future clinical trials will support or justify the continued development of CB 2782-PEG or CB 4332, or that we will receive approval from the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities in other countries, to advance the development of CB 2782-PEG or CB 4332.\nOur ability to generate revenue from our product candidates, which may not occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval, obtaining of manufacturing supply, capacity and expertise, and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 or any other product candidates that we develop or otherwise may acquire will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u2022\nthe number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n\u2022\nfiling acceptable investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacture the product candidates and complete associated regulatory activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing and successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment and timely completion of clinical trials, including our ability to generate positive data from any such clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the development of any additional development programs and product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations;\n\u2022\nreceipt of timely marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and expanding sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of products, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the benefits and use of our products, including method of administration, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, for their approved indications;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 or any other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative therapies for any product candidate that we develop;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, if and when approved, and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, including Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLPs, and cGMPs, and to comply effectively with other rules, regulations and procedures applicable to the development and sale of pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022\npotential significant and changing government regulation, regulatory guidance and requirements and evolving treatment guidelines;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement and patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of the products following approval; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of any business interruptions to our operations or those of third parties with which we work, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize the product candidates we develop, which would materially harm our business. Failure to successfully advance the development of our complement product candidates, including CB 2782-PEG and CB 4332, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nCB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 and all of our other product candidates will require additional clinical testing before they can be sold.\nOur product candidates must satisfy rigorous regulatory standards of safety and efficacy before we can advance or complete their clinical development or they can be approved for sale. To satisfy these standards, we must engage in expensive and lengthy preclinical studies and clinical trials, develop acceptable manufacturing processes, and obtain regulatory approval of our complement product candidates. Despite these efforts, our complement product candidates may not:\n\u2022\noffer therapeutic or other medical benefits over existing drugs or other product candidates in development to treat the same patient population;\n\u2022\nbe proven to be safe and effective in current and future preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nhave the desired effects;\n\u2022\nbe free from undesirable or unexpected effects;\n\u2022\nmeet applicable regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nbe capable of being formulated and manufactured in commercially suitable quantities and at an acceptable cost; or\n\u2022\nbe successfully commercialized by us or by collaborators.\nEven if we demonstrate favorable results in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials, we cannot assure you that the results of late-stage clinical trials will be favorable enough to support the continued development of our product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries have experienced significant delays, setbacks and failures in all stages of development, including late-stage clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing or early-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, results from completed preclinical studies of our complement product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in human clinical trials. Furthermore, even if the data collected from preclinical studies and clinical trials involving our complement product candidates demonstrate a favorable safety and efficacy profile, such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of a biologics license application to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA in the United States or other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, which is required to market and sell the products.\nOur product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts, the commitment of substantial financial resources, and regulatory approvals prior to advancing into clinical development or being commercialized by us or collaborators. We cannot assure you that CB 4332 or CB 2782-PEG will successfully progress into clinical development or through the drug development process or will result in commercially viable products. We do not expect any of our other complement product candidates to be commercialized by us or collaborators for at least several years.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the commencement of clinical trials or patient enrollment in clinical trials, our regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate, enroll and maintain enrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In particular, there is a relatively small number of individuals with CFI deficiency or dry AMD for whom CB 2782-PEG or CB 4332 can be used in clinical trials. The availability of other approved products and other products in clinical trials have and may limit the number of patients willing to participate in our clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022\nthe severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u2022\nthe perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of other product candidates in the same indication;\n\u2022\nlaboratory testing and turnaround time for samples needed for eligibility assessments;\n\u2022\nthe patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials will result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in clinical trials conducted by us may also result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the Company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe operations of our third-party manufacturers may be requisitioned, diverted or allocated by U.S. or foreign government orders such as under emergency, disaster and civil defense declarations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nThe third-party manufacturers of our complement product candidates have advised us that they could be required under orders of the U.S. government to allocate manufacturing capacity to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. If any of our third-party manufacturers become subject to acts or orders of U.S. or foreign government entities to allocate manufacturing capacity to the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 vaccines or medical supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients, this could delay or interrupt, perhaps substantially, our supply of clinical trial material for MarzAA which could materially and adversely affect our business. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.\u201d\nThe coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may impact our third-party supply of the raw materials and components needed for our product candidates, which increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of such product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development efforts.\nIf supplies of the raw materials for our product candidates are significantly delayed, or if the third parties that we engage to supply any materials or to manufacture any products for our preclinical tests and clinical trials should cease to continue to do so for any reason, including due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we likely would experience delays in advancing these tests and trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers or manufacturers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur current and anticipated dependence upon third-party suppliers may adversely affect our ability to develop product candidates and could delay our clinical trials and development programs, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nRisks related to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates\nOur complement product candidates may cause the generation of neutralizing antibodies, which could prevent their further development.\nCB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 and our other complement product candidates are protein molecules which may cause the generation of antibodies in individuals who receive them. If clinical trials demonstrate a treatment-related neutralizing immunological response in individuals that causes safety concerns or would limit the efficacy of either product candidate, development of the product candidate could be halted.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we must focus on development programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332 and our other complement product candidates. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications for these product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to build a pipeline of additional product candidates.\nWe may not be able to continue to identify and develop new product candidates in addition to our current pipeline. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development. For example, product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be successfully developed, much less receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nResults from preclinical or early stage clinical trials may not be confirmed in later trials, and if serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any preclinical studies and clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. The clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure at any stage of drug development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a suitable population of patients, the occurrence of severe or medically or commercially unacceptable adverse events, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements and determination by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority that a drug product is not approvable. It is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials we may fail to detect toxicity of or intolerability caused by our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case.\nIn addition, the outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of late-stage clinical trials. Trials of our product candidates in larger numbers of patients may not have similar efficacy results and could result in adverse effects that were not observed in the earlier trials with smaller numbers of patients.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we may face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether our results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials that we may conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of the product candidate to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Any such limitations could adversely affect the value of our product candidates or common stock.\nFast Track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nThe FDA grants Fast Track designation to therapies that are considered capable of addressing unmet medical needs and possess the potential to treat serious or life-threatening disease conditions in order to facilitate its development and expedite the review procedure. The FDA has broad discretion in granting Fast Track designation, so even if we believe that a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation, the FDA could decide not to grant it. Even though Marzeptacog alfa (activated)-or MarzAA-has received Fast Track designation in certain indications, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval, or receive FDA approval at all, in any of those indications compared to conventional FDA procedures. A Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval. The FDA may also withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nBreakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for any product candidate may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval.\nWe may, in the future, apply for breakthrough therapy designation, or the equivalent thereof in foreign jurisdictions (where available), for our product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the BLA.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nWe expect to seek to establish additional collaborations, and, if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We have previously relied on collaborators, such as Biogen, Pfizer and ISU, to contribute to the development of our product candidates. We may seek one or more additional collaborators for the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. For example, we are seeking a new collaborator to develop MarzAA or DalcA, and we are also seeking collaborators for our complement programs.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we can reach a definitive agreement with a collaborator will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of preclinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the regulatory pathway for any such approval, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering the product to patients and the potential of competing products. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us. There can also be no assurance that we will enter into any collaboration agreements, or that any such agreements will be on favorable terms.\nCollaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, and increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical testing and expect to continue to do so for clinical testing and commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities or quality of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently have no internal capabilities to manufacture our product candidates for clinical use or for preclinical trials following good manufacturing practices (\u201cGMP\u201d), or good laboratory practices (\u201cGLP\u201d). We expect to rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture, package, label and distribute clinical supplies and commercial quantities of any product candidate that we commercialize following approval for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities. We also expect to rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical trials. Reliance on such third-party contractors entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and negotiate manufacturing and supply agreements with suitable manufacturers;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing delays if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nthe failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe possible mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nAlthough we do not currently rely on third parties with operations in Russia or Ukraine, some of our vendors may do so, and disruptions in supply of materials or components to our vendors as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect us. We may incur delays in product development resulting from the need to identify or qualify manufacturers for our product candidates. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our product candidates and any future products.\nTo date, our product candidates have been manufactured by third-party manufacturers solely for preclinical studies and relatively small clinical trials. The process of manufacturing our complement associated therapeutic product candidates is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe process of manufacturing biologics is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error and improper storage conditions. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, the manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and eliminate the contamination;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor and raw material shortages, financial difficulties of our contract manufacturers, including as a result of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, power failures, local political unrest and numerous other factors; and\n\u2022\nany adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations or the scale up of manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the supply of our product candidates. We may also have to record inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for product candidates or drug substances that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek costlier manufacturing alternatives.\nSpecifically, we have entered into various development, manufacturing and clinical supply services agreements with third-party manufacturers for drug substance and drug product manufacturing of our product candidates CB 2782-PEG, CB 4332, MarzAA, and DalcA. If our third-party manufacturers are not able to provide us with sufficient quantities or quality of our of product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, whether due to production shortages or other supply delays or interruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our preclinical\ntrials, clinical trials or regulatory approvals, as applicable, may be delayed. Significant portions of our research and development resources are focused on manufacturing. If any of our third-party manufacturers experiences difficulties in scaling production or experiences product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error or improper storage conditions, the potential trials of the affected product candidate would be delayed, perhaps substantially, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe have minimal process development capabilities and have access only to external manufacturing capabilities. We do not have, and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in clinical trials or commercialization. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial material or preclinical trial material could delay the completion of clinical trials or preclinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining such trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials or preclinical trials at additional expense or terminate the trials completely.\nWe and our contract manufacturers will be subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products. The manufacturing facilities on which we will rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical studies or commercial sale, including any contract manufacturers for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical studies must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA\u2019s GLP and GMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection or do not have a GMP compliance status acceptable for the FDA, FDA approval of the products will not be granted.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third-party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical studies may be delayed, or we could lose potential revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and any clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such tasks or trials.\nWe rely on third parties such as contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct certain aspects of preclinical development, including assay development and testing, and to enroll qualified patients and conduct, supervise and monitor clinical trials. Our reliance on these third parties for preclinical and clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Our reliance on these third parties, however, will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities, including ensuring that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, and the investigational plan and protocols contained in the relevant regulatory application, such as an investigational new drug application, or IND. In addition, the CROs with whom we contract may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our preclinical studies or clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our efforts to complete development and obtain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize, our product candidates may be delayed or prevented.\nRisks related to employee matters, managing growth and our business operations\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our executive management and scientific personnel. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. In addition, we will need to add personnel to achieve our business objectives. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees, and our inability to find suitable replacements, or our inability to hire new clinical development and manufacturing personnel, could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nWe conduct operations at our facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. This region is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at Catalyst, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in the Company\u2019s stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of management and scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with the Company on short notice. Our employees are under at-will employment arrangements, which means that any of our employees can leave employment with Catalyst at any time, with or without notice. Failure to retain, replace or recruit personnel could harm our business.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and collaborators. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-US regulators, to provide accurate information to the FDA and non-US regulators, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, to report financial information or\ndata accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained during clinical studies that could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. Stockholder activism, the political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that are not currently anticipated. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. In addition, these rules and regulations make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. We expect that we will annually incur significant expenses to comply with the requirements imposed on us as a public company.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is prone to earthquakes. Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans that, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect or enforce intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of our patents, which may result in those patents being narrowed or invalidated. The patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. The current conflict between Russia and Ukraine may make it difficult or impossible to continue to prosecute patent applications or maintain patents in those countries or other affected territories. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent\napplications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Certain of our patents also cover processes, for which enforcement can be difficult. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties that may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf the patents or patent applications we hold or have in-licensed for our programs or product candidates are invalidated or fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could threaten our ability to commercialize future products. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent and other elements of our product candidate discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information.\nFurther, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter partes reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates infringes patents held by such third parties, or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions of matter, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. There is a patent family pending in the U.S. in which claims that may read on MarzAA have been filed. We, however, do not believe such claims are patentable. If they were to issue, we would take appropriate action to challenge their enforceability and/or validity. We are also aware of additional patents that have issued in the United States and Europe that have claims related to Factor VII. We do not believe that MarzAA does or will infringe any valid claims in such patents.\nIn addition, we have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties, and we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates unless we redesigned infringing products (which may be impossible) or obtained a license under the applicable patents (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all), or until such patents expire.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we or our collaborators may be required to file infringement claims that can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, would cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, in addition\nto paying royalties, redesign infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third-party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nRisks related to regulatory approval of our product candidates and other compliance matters\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nWhile we have multiple drug candidates in clinical and advanced preclinical development for a range of diseases, we have not yet submitted BLAs for our engineered human proteases to the FDA, or similar approval filings to comparable foreign authorities. Submission of a BLA requires extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information that demonstrates the product candidate\u2019s safety, purity, and potency, also known as safety and effectiveness, for each desired indication. A BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. However, failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage in the clinical trial process. Accordingly, the regulatory pathway for our product candidates is still uncertain, complex, and lengthy, and ultimately, approval may not be obtained.\nWe may experience delays in completing planned clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial resources to commence and complete the planned trials;\n\u2022\ninability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining approval at each clinical trial site by an independent institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d);\n\u2022\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in trials;\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites\u037e and\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of qualified materials under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) regulations and applying them on a subject-by-subject basis for use in clinical trials.\nWe could also experience delays in obtaining approval if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles given the serious nature of the diseases for the core indications for our product candidates. Additionally, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions\nin which the trials are being conducted, the Data Monitoring Committee for the trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues, or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. In addition, the FDA review and approval process could be delayed by any future shutdown of the U.S. government, and our development activities could be harmed or delayed as a result. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. Additionally, delays in completing trials will increase costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and impair our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Many of the factors that could create or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may lead to the denial of regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nThe FDA may disagree with our regulatory plan and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe results of clinical trials we conduct may not support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and may not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. These regulations include:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and which will constrain our marketing practices and the marketing practices of our licensees, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services\u201d with whom the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent, and which may expose entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers to potential criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and including as a result of claims presented in violation of the Federal Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other healthcare-related laws, including laws enforced by the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services that, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nfederal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which requires manufacturers of approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and\n\u2022\nstate and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and which may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws such as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs,\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions.\nLegislative and regulatory actions affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently. In the United States, the ACA was enacted in 2010 to expand healthcare coverage. Since then, numerous efforts have been made to repeal, amend or administratively limit the ACA in whole or in part. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Trump in 2017, repealed the individual health insurance mandate, which is considered a key component of the ACA. In December 2018, a Texas federal district court struck down the ACA on the grounds that the individual health insurance mandate is unconstitutional, although this ruling has been stayed pending appeal. The ongoing challenges to the ACA and new legislative proposals have resulted in uncertainty regarding the ACA\u2019s future viability and destabilization of the health insurance market. The resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\nEfforts to control prescription drug prices could also have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) released the \u201cAmerican Patients First Blueprint\u201d and have begun implementing certain portions. The initiative includes proposals to increase generic drug and biosimilar competition, enable the Medicare program to negotiate drug prices more directly and improve transparency regarding drug prices and ways to lower consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. The Trump administration also proposed to establish an \u201cinternational pricing index\u201d that would be used as a benchmark to determine the costs and potentially limit the reimbursement of drugs under Medicare Part B. Among other pharmaceutical manufacturer industry-related proposals, Congress has proposed bills to change the Medicare Part D benefit to impose an inflation-based rebate in Medicare Part D and to alter the benefit structure to increase manufacturer contributions in the catastrophic phase. The volume of drug pricing-related bills has dramatically increased under the current Congress, and the resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material.\nIn addition, many states have proposed or enacted legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, in 2017, California\u2019s governor signed a prescription drug price transparency state bill into law, requiring prescription drug manufacturers to provide advance notice and explanation for price increases of certain drugs that exceed a specified threshold. Both Congress and state legislatures are considering various bills that would reform drug purchasing and price negotiations, allow greater use of utilization management tools to limit Medicare Part D coverage, facilitate the import of lower-priced drugs from outside the United States and encourage the use of generic drugs. Such initiatives and legislation may cause added pricing pressures on our products.\nChanges to the Medicaid program at the federal or state level could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Proposals that could impact coverage and reimbursement of our products, including giving states more flexibility to manage drugs covered under the Medicaid program and permitting the re-importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries, could have a material adverse effect by limiting our products\u2019 use and coverage. Furthermore, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of an increase in the federal base Medicaid rebate. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, they could use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and the adverse effects may be magnified by their adoption of lower payment schedules.\nOther proposed regulatory actions affecting manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is difficult to predict the impact, if any, of any such proposed legislative and regulatory actions or resulting state actions on the use and reimbursement of our products in the United States, but our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to evolving privacy and data protection laws, including HIPAA and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). If we fail to protect personal information or comply with existing or future data protection regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nNumerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, and other processing of personal information. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information (as defined in HIPAA) (\u201cPHI\u201d) by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, such as us, to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, use and disclosure of electronic PHI, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information, and certain notification requirements in the event of a data breach.\nBy virtue of our clinical trial activities in Europe, we are also subject to European data protection laws, including the GDPR (as implemented in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d) and the United Kingdom). The GDPR which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes stringent requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords various data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes potential penalties for serious breaches of up to 4.0% annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater. Individuals (e.g., study subjects) also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). There may be circumstances under which a failure to comply with the GDPR, or the exercise of individual rights under the GDPR, would limit our ability to utilize clinical trial data collected on study subjects. The GDPR imposes additional responsibility and liability in relation to our processing of personal data. This may be onerous and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The GDPR also prohibits the international transfer of personal data from the EEA/UK to countries outside of the EEA/United Kingdom unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission or a data transfer mechanism has been put in place.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are subject to various U.S. state laws which may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of our product candidates harms patients or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to our product candidates, regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted, and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that our product candidates may induce adverse events. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation\u037e\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants\u037e\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation\u037e\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business\u037e\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants\u037e\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates\u037e and\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe carry product liability insurance of $10,000,000 per occurrence and $10,000,000 aggregate limit. We believe our product liability insurance coverage is sufficient for our current clinical programs; however, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nPatients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and share price.\nIn connection with the preparation and audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our material weakness related to the following control deficiency: we did not design and maintain effective controls related to the review of certain contracts, including the proper application of U.S. GAAP. Specifically, we did not design and maintain controls to properly review the retention bonuses granted to our employees in November 2021 after our reduction in workforce to assess the appropriate accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.\nTo address our material weakness, we are evaluating our accounting policy over monitoring and reviewing contracts so that contracts with a significant impact are reviewed and U.S. GAAP is properly applied. We are also formalizing our internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our management. While these actions and planned actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period, we are committed to continuous improvement and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting.\nWhile we believe these efforts will remediate the material weakness, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing or any required remediation in a timely fashion, or at all. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date and may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiency that led to our material weakness in internal control over financial reporting or that we will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness or identify additional material weaknesses in the future, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the forms of the SEC, could be adversely affected which, in turn, may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, any such failures could result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, loss of investor confidence, delisting of our securities and harm to our reputation and financial condition, or diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of our business.\nRisks related to commercialization of our product candidates\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, we may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current hemophilia treatments like intravenous NovoSeven RT are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe subcutaneous efficacy and potential advantages compared with alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices\u037e\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of subcutaneous administration compared with alternative treatments\u037e\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies\u037e\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support\u037e\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement\u037e\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects\u037e and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nOur product candidates are years away from regulatory approval.\nOur development candidates are not expected to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Further, the commercial success of either product candidate will depend upon its acceptance by physicians, individuals, third-party payors and other key decision-makers as a therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to products available at the time, which may include competing products currently under development by others. See \u201cWe face substantial competition that may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\u201d If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner (including due to reasons that are beyond our control, such as changes in regulations or a shutdown of the federal government, including the FDA) and commercialize our development candidates, our ability to generate revenue from product sales will be significantly delayed and our business will be materially and adversely affected, and we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern.\nEven if the FDA or other regulatory agency approves our product candidates, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product and may impose ongoing commitments or requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. The FDA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. Regulatory approval from authorities in foreign countries will be needed to market our product candidates in those countries. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to obtain approvals from foreign jurisdictions, the geographic market for our product candidates would be limited.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved.\nWe have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure for our product candidates, which are still in preclinical or early clinical development. We have not yet developed a commercial strategy for our product candidates. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization within the United States and develop a strategy for sales outside of the United States.\nThere are risks involved with establishing internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into additional arrangements with third parties to perform these services, then our product revenues and profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves.\nWe face substantial competition that may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we\nsuccessfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nAlthough there are no currently approved treatments for dry AMD, several companies are developing cyclic peptide, aptamer, antibody or gene therapy based anti-complement product candidates in clinical studies. Apellis is conducting two Phase 3 studies to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal APL-2 therapy with sham injections in patients aged 60 years and older with GA secondary to AMD; Iveric Bio (formerly Ophthotech) is developing two therapies to treat GA secondary to dry AMD, iveric Bio completed its Phase 2b clinical of Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol) with positive data in patients with dry AMD; Gemini Therapeutics is developing \u201cGEM103\u201d a recombinant human complement factor H (\u201cFH\u201d) for patients with genetically well-defined dry AMD and \u201cGEM104,\u201d a recombinant human complement factor I as well as additional molecules in preclinical development for other genetically defined subpopulations of patients with dry AMD, Gyroscope Therapeutics is developing \u201cGT005\u201d a gene therapeutic approach to expressing additional CFI in the patient\u2019s eye after subretinal delivery, and NGM Biopharmaceuticals is expecting topline data from the Phase 2a study (CATALINA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal NGM621 in the fourth quarter of 2022. NGM621 is a C3-targeting monoclonal antibody being developed to treat geographic atropy secondary to AMD. In addition, there are currently no approved agents specifically targeting systemic factor I deficiency patients irrespective of the resultant disease phenotype being aHUS, C3G, IC-MPGN, invasive infections or any other or any approved therapies for C3G and IC-MPGN. However, there are less specific treatment options on the market or in clinical development which may be applicable to some disease manifestations of systemic CFI deficiency, for instance aHUS and C3G. These treatment options include: eculizumab and ravulizumab marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (a division of AstraZeneca) for use in aHUS irrespective of the patients\u2019 CFI status; APL-2 (pegcetacoplan), a pegylated peptide based C3 inhibitor, in IgA Nephropathy (\u201cIgAN\u201d), LN, Membranous Nephropathy (\u201cMN\u201d), C3G, and Dense Deposit Disease which is in clinical development by Apellis; TAVENOS (avacopan), a twice daily oral small molecule inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor (\u201cC5aR\u201d) in C3G currently marketed by ChemoCentryx for use in combination with other standard of care such as glucocorticoids to treat adults with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and being is further being developed for in C3G and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (\u201cHS\u201d) in ongoing phase 2 studies; iptacopan (\u201cLNP023\u201d), a small peptide complement factor B inhibitor which is currently in development by Novartis for PNH, C3G and several other rare renal diseases including IgAN, aHUS, and membranous nephropathy; Omeros has initiated clinical activities in igAN, LN, MN, & C3G and a phase 3 clinical program in aHUS with OMS721 (\u201cnarsoplimab\u201d), a human monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (\u201cMASP-2\u201d), the effector enzyme of the lectin pathway of the complement system; and Argenx is developing ARGX-117, a humanized antibody targeting complement compenent 2 (\u201cC2\u201d) intended to inhibit the function of C2 and downstream complement activation. ARGX-117 is currently in a Phase 1 study for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (\u201cMMN\u201d).\nOur commercial opportunity in different indications could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products or therapies that are more convenient to use, more effective, less expensive, and safer to use than our products. Furthermore, if competitors gain FDA approval earlier than we do, we may be unable to establish a strong market presence or to gain market share. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and individual registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nEven if we commercialize any product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives that would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we may obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for certain medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we or our collaborators commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Reimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate that receives marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.\nReimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and overall financial condition.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care,\npharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than expected, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development on hemostasis and inflammation treatment. Our projections of both the number of people who suffer from related conditions, as well as the subset of people with these conditions who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected or may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nRisks related to our common stock\nThe market price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been highly volatile and there have been significant periods of time in which the trading volume of our common stock has been low, which can contribute to volatility in price. Additionally, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Factors giving rise to this volatility may include:\n\u2022\ndisclosure of clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments in both the United States and abroad\u037e\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters\u037e\n\u2022\ndisclosure of new collaborations or other strategic transactions\u037e\n\u2022\npublic concern about the safety or efficacy of product candidates or technology, their components, or related technology or new technologies generally\u037e\n\u2022\npublic announcements by competitors or others regarding new products or new product candidates\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and comments by securities analysts and investors.\nFluctuations in operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Some of the factors that may cause operating results to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include the scope, progress, duration results and costs of preclinical and clinical development programs, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments of product candidates and programs, restructuring costs, implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, non-recurring\nrevenue or expenses under any such agreement, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory compliance, approvals or other regulatory actions and general and industry-specific economic conditions, particularly as affects the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical or biotechnology industries in the United States. Period-to-period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Fluctuating losses may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur current trading volumes are modest, and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price to decline. We have effective registration statements on Form S-3 that enables us to sell up to $150.0 million of securities in one or more offerings, subject to limitations under applicable SEC rules, including up to $50.0 million of common stock issuable under our Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler & Co. Any additional sales in the public market of our common stock or other securities under these shelf registration statements could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, we have outstanding options to purchase 2,603,630 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $7.70 as of December 31, 2021. If such options are exercised and the shares are sold into the open market, such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Conversion or exercise of these securities into shares of our common stock will cause dilution to the other holders of our common stock, and all such stock may be sold in the public market after conversion or exercise, subject to restrictions under the securities laws, which may lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents may make a change in control or efforts to remove management more difficult. Also, under Delaware law, our board of directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures. The existence of the following provisions of Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. If the board of directors exercises this power to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and vote the stock they acquire to remove management or directors.\nOur restated certificate also provides staggered terms for the members of our board of directors, and that directors may be removed by stockholders only by vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of voting shares then outstanding. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws do not permit stockholders to call special or annual meetings of stockholders, or to act by written consent without a meeting. These provisions may prevent stockholders from replacing the entire board in a single proxy contest, making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions could also delay the removal of management by the board of directors with or without cause.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a publicly-held corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of our voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nOne of our stockholders, on behalf of himself and certain other stockholders, has requested that we add three individuals to our board of directors to replace existing directors and take steps to declassify our board of directors. Although we have engaged in negotions with this stockholder to reach an agreement regarding his requests, we may not be able to do so, and this stockholder may engage in proxy solicitations and submit proposals for consideration at our upcoming annual meeting. Such an activist campaign could conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs, and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategy, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe have been a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and thus have been allowed to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings. We have also had certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings. We cannot predict whether investors find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 91184, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CBIO"}
